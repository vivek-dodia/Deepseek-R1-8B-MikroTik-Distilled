Hi all,i would like to force an ntp update/sync directly after reboot on an hAP axÂ³ running RouterOS v7 with container mode. I is crucial for me the system gets the correct time immediately after reboot for my container application and logging.As far as i understand, the ntp client syncs about every 3 hours, so after a reboot i have a wrong system time for about that time? See following log example/IP/Cloud time sync is deactivated.Here is an example of one of my Systems with relevant logs from yesterday, reboot and NTP update:Code:Select allLast Log entry, then reboot, i think it startet with the time of the last ntp update, maybe?Code:Select all...rebooted again --> and again startet with the same time, then ntp update nearly three hours later:Code:Select allSo an easy fix would be to force an ntp update after reboot, but i did not find a solutionShould i disable and reenable ntp via boot up script? Any recommendations would help, thanks in advance

Code:Select allLooks like it was either1. powered off for quite some time2. The time had not been saved to flash more recently while it was running.I think 2 is more likely. (Don't want to keep updating flash just because time has changed)

I read this log differently:Code:Select allAt *some time* the router rebooted, at the time it booted the clock value was Feb/15/2024 14:20:20Code:Select allAfter some time, 4 minutes and 22 seconds after the reboot, the NTP synchronized and changed the time from 14:24:42 to 17:11:42.That it takes 4 minutes 22 seconds (262 seconds) to synchronize the NTP (usual values are between 64 and 1024 seconds) seems to me "normal" (or rather "possible").The question isWHENall this happened, since the log entry on Feb/15/2024 17:11:42 is about the actual time set to Feb/15/2024 17:11:42, the second entry happened at 17:11:42.But the same message says that at that exact time, the clock was at 14:24:42.The first entry says that it happened at 14:20:20m but in reality it happened 14:24:42-14:20:20=4:22 before the second one, i.e. it happened 4:22 seconds before 17:11:42, at 17:07:20.So it is the date/time of the first log entry (the reboot one) that is "off", the NTP is IMHO updating in a reasonable time after reboot.

... many thanks for reading my log. You are right, it only took 4 minutes what i did not realize by reading only the time at the beginning of the line...Yes, the logging could have been clearer;Code:Select allif split in two or more lines (hypothetical and probably a bit too verbose)Code:Select allThis way it would be evident that the sync happened at the "previous" time.
