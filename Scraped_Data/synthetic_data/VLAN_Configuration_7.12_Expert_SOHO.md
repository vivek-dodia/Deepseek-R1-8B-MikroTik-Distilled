**VLAN Configuration on MikroTik RouterOS 7.12**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

* Create and configure multiple VLANs for traffic segmentation.
* Assign VLANs to physical interfaces to define network boundaries.
* Control inter-VLAN communication through firewall rules and other access-control mechanisms.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**Creating VLANs**

1. Navigate to "Interfaces" > "VLAN".
2. Click the "+" button to create a new VLAN interface.
3. In the "VLAN ID" field, specify the VLAN number (e.g., 10).
4. Click "Apply".

**Assigning VLANs to Interfaces**

1. Navigate to "Interfaces" > [Physical Interface].
2. Select the "VLAN" tab.
3. In the "VLAN ID" field, specify the VLAN number to assign.
4. Disable all unused VLANs.
5. Click "Apply".

**Configuring Inter-VLAN Communication**

**Firewall Rules:**

1. Navigate to "IP" > "Firewall" > "Rules".
2. Create a new firewall rule to allow traffic between VLANs.
    - Specify the source VLAN, destination VLAN, and protocol.
3. Click "Apply".

**Example Firewall Rule:**

```
add action=accept chain=forward dst-address-list=vlan10 in-interface=port1 out-interface=port2 protocol=tcp dst-port=80
```

**Other Access-Control Mechanisms:**

* **ACL (Access Control List):** Specify which MAC addresses, IP addresses, or protocols are allowed to pass through the VLAN.
* **Security Profiles:** Apply security settings to specific VLANs, such as firewall rules, address lists, and MAC filters.

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

* **VLAN ID Conflict:** Ensure that VLAN IDs do not conflict between different interfaces or devices.
* **Tagged vs. Untagged Frames:** Configure physical interfaces to correctly tag or untag VLAN frames.
* **Firewall Rule Ordering:** Position firewall rules in the correct order to allow or deny traffic as intended.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

* Check the VLAN status on physical interfaces: "Interfaces" > [Physical Interface] > "VLAN" tab.
* Ping between devices assigned to different VLANs.
* Verify access control rules by attempting to connect from one VLAN to another.

**Related Features and Considerations**

* **Q-in-Q (802.1ad):** Support for nested VLANs, allowing multiple VLANs within a single physical interface.
* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):** Prevent loops and ensure network stability in multi-VLAN environments.
* **Security:** Implement strong security policies on inter-VLAN communication to prevent unauthorized access.
