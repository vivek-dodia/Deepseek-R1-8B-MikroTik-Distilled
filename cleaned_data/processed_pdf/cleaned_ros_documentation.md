## Hardware Support
MikroTik made devices: RouterOS is  compatible with MikroTik hardware it comes preinstalled on. Even MikroTik devices that are no longer manufactured, can run the latest RouterOS versions and
will receive software updates. There are a few exceptions to this for the very oldest product lines. The latest RouterOS v7 is not compatible with all MIPS-LE family of devices (such as RB100, series,
some RB700 series devices etc. please check the architecture of the device in question). It is also not compatible with MikroTik devices that have 32MB of RAM or less, but a minimum of 64MB is
suggested. In short, there is no set limit on software compatibility or upgrades. Even devices that are no longer manufactured for 20 years, will still receive software updates, as long as they have
enough RAM and are not based on a MIPS-LE CPU.
3rd party devices: RouterOS can also be run on 3rd party devices if they meet the following requirements:
```
x86 or AMPERE powered ARM CPU
Minimum 64MB of RAM
IDE, SATA, USB, and flash storage medium with a minimum of 64MB of space
Network cards supported by Linux kernel
```

## Installation

## Connecting to the Router
There are two types of routers:
```
Routers with default configuration.
Routers without default configuration. In cases where no specific configuration is present, the IP address 192.168.88.1/24 is assigned to ether1,
combo1, sfp1, or MGMT/BOOT.
```
For additional details regarding the current default configuration, please refer to the Quick Guide document provided with your device. This document
outlines which ports to initially utilize for connection and instructions on device setup.
This document describes the step-by-step process for configuring the device from scratch. Therefore, we recommend clearing all defaults when initiating
the setup.
When connecting the first time to the router with the default username admin and no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords
on the sticker). Upon the initial boot, a notification will appear, offering you the choice to either remove the default configuration (even if the default config
has only an IP address), leading to a reboot with no configuration applied, or to "Show Script" and retain the current default configuration, applying it
accordingly. Since this article assumes that there is no configuration on the router, you should remove it by pressing "r" on the keyboard when prompted or
click on the "Remove Configuration" button in WinBox.

## Router without Default Configuration
If the router doesn't have a default configuration, there are multiple options to consider. However, in this case, we'll opt for a method that best fits our
requirements.
Connect the ISP cable to the router's ether1 port and connect your PC to any port except ether1. Then, launch WinBox and search for your router using
the neighbor discovery feature. See detailed example in Winbox article.
If the router appears in the list, select its MAC address and click Connect.
The easiest method to ensure a completely clean router is to run the CLI command
```
/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes
```
Or from WinBox:
Configuring IP Access
As MAC connection can sometimes be unreliable, our first step is to configure the router to enable IP connectivity:
```
Create a bridge interface and assign bridge ports;
Assign an IP address to the bridge interface;
Configure a DHCP server.
```
Setting up the bridge and assigning an IP address are straightforward processes:
```
/interface bridge add name=bridge
/interface bridge port add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge
```
If you prefer WinBox/WebFig as configuration tools:
```
Open Bridge window, Bridge tab should be selected;
Click on the + button to open a new dialog box. You can either enter a custom bridge name or retain the default bridge1, then click OK to proceed;
Switch to the Ports tab and click on the + button to open another dialog box;
Select interface ether2 and bridge bridge1 form drop-down lists and click on the OK button to apply settings;
You may close the bridge dialog.
```
Access the IP menu and navigate to the Addresses dialog;
Select the + button to open a new dialog box;
Enter IP address 192.168.88.1/24 select interface bridge1 from the drop-down list;
Click OK to confirm the settings.
Next, proceed with setting up a DHCP server. To simplify and expedite this process, we'll execute the setup command.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip dhcp-server/ setup [enter]
Select interface to run DHCP server on
```
```
dhcp server interface: bridge1 [enter]
Select network for DHCP addresses
```
```
dhcp address space: 192.168.88.0/24 [enter]
Select gateway for given network
```
```
gateway for dhcp network: 192.168.88.1 [enter]
Select pool of ip addresses given out by DHCP server
```
```
addresses to give out: 192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 [enter]
Select DNS servers
```
```
dns servers: 192.168.88.1 [enter]
Select lease time
```
```
lease time: 1800 [enter]
```
Notice that most of the configuration options are automatically determined and you just simply need to hit the enter key.
The setup tool is also accessible in WinBox/WebFig:
```
Navigate to IP -> DHCP Server window, ensuring the DHCP tab is selected;
Click on the DHCP Setup button to open a new dialog;
Select the bridge1 as the DHCP Server Interface and click Next;
Follow the wizard to complete the setup.
```
Following these steps, the connected PC should now obtain a dynamic IP address. You can then close Winbox and reconnect to the router using the IP
address (192.168.88.1).
Configuring Internet Connection
To enable internet access for the router, you'll need to configure one of the following common types of internet connections:
```
Dynamic public IP address.
Static public IP address.
PPPoE connection.
```
Dynamic Public IP
Dynamic address configuration is the easiest option. Simply set up a DHCP client on the public interface. The DHCP client will obtain information from your
Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as an IP address, DNS servers, NTP servers, and default route, making the setup process straightforward for you.
```
/ip dhcp-client add disabled=no interface=ether
```
After adding the client you should see the assigned address and status should be bound
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip dhcp-client print
Columns: INTERFACE, USE-PEER-DNS, ADD-DEFAULT-ROUTE, STATUS, ADDRESS
# INTERFACE USE-PEER-DNS ADD-DEFAULT-ROUTE STATUS ADDRESS
0 ether1 yes yes bound 1.2.3.100/
```
Static Public IP
When configuring a static address, your ISP provides specific parameters, such as:
```
IP: 1.2.3.100/
Gateway: 1.2.3.
DNS: 8.8.8.
```
These are three basic parameters that you need to get the internet connection working.
To configure this in RouterOS, we'll manually add an IP address, add a default route with a provided gateway, and set up a DNS server
```
/ip address add address=1.2.3.100/24 interface=ether
/ip route add gateway=1.2.3.
/ip dns set servers=8.8.8.
```
PPPoE Connection
PPPoE connection also gives you a dynamic IP address and can configure dynamically DNS and default gateway. Typically service provider (ISP) gives
you a username and password for the connection
```
/interface pppoe-client
add disabled=no interface=ether1 user=me password=123 \
add-default-route=yes use-peer-dns=yes
```
Winbox/WebFig actions:
```
In the PPP window, select the Interfaces tab and click the "+" button;
Choose PPPoE Client from the dropdown list;
Set the name and select ether1 as the interface;
Go to the Dial Out tab, configure the username, password, and other parameters;
Click OK to save the settings.
```
```
Further in configuration, the WAN interface is now the pppoe-out1 interface, not ether1.
```
Verify Connectivity
Once the configuration is complete, you should be able to access the internet from the router. To verify IP connectivity, try pinging a known IP address,
such as a Google DNS server.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping 8.8.8.
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
0 8.8.8.8 56 55 14ms399us
1 8.8.8.8 56 55 18ms534us
2 8.8.8.8 56 55 14ms384us
```
Verify DNS request
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping google.com
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
0 142.250.74.14 56 55 14ms475us
1 142.250.74.14 56 55 14ms308us
2 142.250.74.14 56 55 14ms238us
```
If all settings are configured correctly, both pings should succeed.
If there's a failure, please refer to the Troubleshooting section for assistance.
Protecting the Router
As the router is now accessible worldwide, it's important to protect it from potential intruders and basic attacks.
User Password Access
For MikroTik routers, it's essential to set up passwords. We recommend using a password generator tool to create robust passwords that meet the
following criteria:
```
At least 12 characters long;
Consist of numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters;
Avoid using dictionary words or combinations thereof.
```
```
/user set 0 password="!={Ba3N!40TX+GvKBzjTLIUcx/,"
```
Another method to set a password for the current user:
```
/password
```
We highly recommend using a secondary method or the Winbox interface to update your router's password, as an added measure to safeguard against
unauthorized access.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /password
old-password: ********
new-password: ****************************
confirm-new-password: ****************************
```
Ensure you remember the password! If it's forgotten, there's no way to recover it. You'll have to reset the configuration or reinstall the router system!
You can also add additional users with full or limited router access in the /user menu
```
The best practice is to create a new user with a strong password and disable or remove the default admin user.
```
```
/user add name=myname password=mypassword group=full
/user remove admin
```
MAC Connectivity Access
By default, the MAC server runs on all interfaces. To restrict MAC connectivity from the WAN port, we'll disable the default all entry and add a LAN
interface.
First, create an interface list:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface list add name=LAN
```
Then, add your previously created bridge named "bridge1" to the interface list:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface list member add list=LAN interface=bridge1
```
```
Note: Log in to the router using the new credentials to verify that the username and password are functioning correctly.
```
Apply newly created interface list to the MAC server:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=LAN
```
Do the same for Winbox MAC access
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=LAN
```
Winbox/Webfig actions:
```
Navigate to Interfaces → Interface List → Lists window;
Click on the "+" button to add a new list;
Enter "LAN" into the Name field and click OK;
Return to the Interfaces → Interface List section;
Click on the "+" button;
```
```
Select "LAN" from the dropdown List options;
Choose "bridge1" from the dropdown Interface options;
Click OK to confirm;
Open Tools -> Mac Server window;
Click on the MAC Telnet Server button;
In the new dialog, select the newly created list "LAN" from the dropdown list;
Click OK to apply settings.
```
Do the same in the MAC Winbox Server tab to block Mac Winbox connections from the internet.
Neighbor Discovery
MikroTik Neighbor discovery protocol is used to show and recognize other MikroTik routers in the network. Disable neighbor discovery on public interfaces:
```
/ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=LAN
```
IP Connectivity Access
While the firewall protects your router from unauthorized access by external networks, it's also possible to restrict username access based on specific IP
addresses
```
/user set 0 address=x.x.x.x/yy
```
x.x.x.x/yy - your IP or network subnet that is allowed to access your router.
IP connectivity on the public interface must be limited in the firewall. We will accept only ICMP(ping/traceroute), IP Winbox, and ssh access.
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input action=accept connection-state=established,related,untracked comment="accept established,
related,untracked"
add chain=input action=drop connection-state=invalid comment="drop invalid"
add chain=input in-interface=ether1 action=accept protocol=icmp comment="accept ICMP"
add chain=input in-interface=ether1 action=accept protocol=tcp port=8291 comment="allow Winbox";
add chain=input in-interface=ether1 action=accept protocol=tcp port=22 comment="allow SSH";
add chain=input in-interface=ether1 action=drop comment="block everything else";
```
The first rule accepts packets from already established connections, assuming they are safe to not overload the CPU. The second rule drops any packet
that connection tracking identifies as invalid. After that, we set up typical accept rules for specific protocols.
If you are using Winbox/WebFig for configuration, here is an example of how to add an established/related/untracked rule:
```
Open the IP -> Firewall window and navigate to the Filter Rules tab;
Click on the "+" button to open a new dialog;
Select "input" for the chain.
Click on "Connection state" and check the boxes for "established," "related," and "untracked."
Go to the Action tab and ensure that "accept" is selected.
Click on OK to apply the settings.
```
```
If the public interface is PPPoE, LTE, or any other type, the 'in-interface' should be set to that interface.
```
To add additional rules, click on the "+" button for each new rule and fill in the same parameters as provided in the console example.
Administrative Services
Although the firewall protects the router from the public interface, you may still want to disable RouterOS services.
Most of RouterOS administrative tools are configured at  the /ip service menu
Keep only secure ones,
```
/ip service disable telnet,ftp,www,api
```
Change default service ports, this will immediately stop most of the random SSH brute force login attempts:
```
/ip service set ssh port=2200
```
Additionally, each service can be secured by allowed IP address or address range(the address service will reply to), although more preferred method is to
block unwanted access in firewall because the firewall will not even allow to open socket
```
/ip service set winbox address=192.168.88.0/24
```
Other Services
A bandwidth server is used to test throughput between two MikroTik routers. Disable it in the production environment.
```
/tool bandwidth-server set enabled=no
```
A router might have DNS cache enabled, which decreases resolving time for DNS requests from clients to remote servers. In case DNS cache is not
required on your router or another router is used for such purposes, disable it.
```
/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=no
```
Some RouterBOARDs have an LCD module for informational purposes, set pin or disable it.
```
/lcd set enabled=no
```
It is good practice to disable all unused interfaces on your router, in order to decrease unauthorized access to your router.
```
/interface print
/interface set x disabled=yes
```
Where "X" is a number of the unused interfaces.
RouterOS utilizes stronger crypto for SSH, most newer programs use it, to turn on SSH strong crypto:
```
/ip ssh set strong-crypto=yes
```
Following services are disabled by default,  nevertheless, it is better to make sure that none of then were enabled accidentally:
```
MikroTik caching proxy,
```
```
/ip proxy set enabled=no
```
```
MikroTik socks proxy,
```
```
/ip socks set enabled=no
```
```
MikroTik UPNP service,
```
```
/ip upnp set enabled=no
```
```
MikroTik dynamic name service or IP cloud,
```
```
/ip cloud set ddns-enabled=no update-time=no
```
NAT Configuration
At this point, PC is not yet able to access the Internet, because locally used addresses are not routable over the Internet. Remote hosts simply do not
know how to correctly reply to your local address.
The solution for this problem is to change the source address for outgoing packets to routers public IP. This can be done with the NAT rule:
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
```
Another benefit of such a setup is that NATed clients behind the router are not directly connected to the Internet, that way additional protection against
attacks from outside mostly is not required.
Port Forwarding
Some client devices may need direct access to the internet over specific ports. For example, a client with an IP address 192.168.88.254 must be
accessible by Remote desktop protocol (RDP).
After a quick search on Google, we find out that RDP runs on TCP port 3389. Now we can add a destination NAT rule to redirect RDP to the client's PC.
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=dstnat protocol=tcp port=3389 in-interface=ether1 \
action=dst-nat to-address=192.168.88.254
```
Setting up Wireless
For ease of use bridged wireless setup will be made so that your wired hosts are in the same Ethernet broadcast domain as wireless clients.
The important part is to make sure that our wireless is protected, so the first step is the security profile.
Security profiles are configured from /interface wireless security-profiles menu in a terminal.
```
/interface wireless security-profiles
add name=myProfile authentication-types=wpa2-psk mode=dynamic-keys \
wpa2-pre-shared-key=1234567890
```
in Winbox/Webfig click on Wireless to open wireless windows and choose the Security Profile tab.
If there are legacy devices that do not support WPA2 (like Windows XP), you may also want to allow WPA protocol.
```
If the public interface is PPPoE, LTE, or any other type, the 'out-interface' should be set to that interface.
```
```
If you have set up strict firewall rules then RDP protocol must be allowed in the firewall filter forward chain.
```
Now when the security profile is ready we can enable the wireless interface and set the desired parameters
```
/interface wireless
enable wlan1;
set wlan1 band=2ghz-b/g/n channel-width=20/40mhz-Ce distance=indoors \
mode=ap-bridge ssid=MikroTik-006360 wireless-protocol=802.11 \
security-profile=myProfile frequency-mode=regulatory-domain \
set country=latvia antenna-gain=3
```
To do the same from Winbox/Webfig:
```
Open Wireless window, select wlan1 interface, and click on the enable button;
Double click on the wireless interface to open the configuration dialog;
In the configuration dialog click on the Wireless tab and click the Advanced mode button on
the right side. When you click on the button additional configuration parameters will appear
and the description of the button will change to Simple mode;
Choose parameters as shown in the screenshot, except for the country settings and SSID.
You may want to also choose a different frequency and antenna gain;
Next, click on the HT tab and make sure both chains are selected;
Click on the OK button to apply settings.
```
The last step is to add a wireless interface to a local bridge, otherwise connected clients will not get an IP address:
```
/interface bridge port
add interface=wlan1 bridge=bridge1
```
Now wireless should be able to connect to your access point, get an IP address, and access the internet.
Protecting the Clients
Now it is time to add some protection for clients on our LAN. We will start with a basic set of rules.
```
WPA and WPA2 pre-shared keys should not be the same.
```
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=fasttrack-connection connection-state=established,related \
comment="fast-track for established,related";
add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related \
comment="accept established,related";
add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid
add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=new connection-nat-state=!dstnat \
in-interface=ether1 comment="drop access to clients behind NAT from WAN"
```
A ruleset is similar to input chain rules (accept established/related and drop invalid), except the first rule with action=fasttrack-connection. This
rule allows established and related connections to bypass the firewall and significantly reduce CPU usage.
Another difference is the last rule which drops all new connection attempts from the WAN port to our LAN network (unless DstNat is used). Without this
rule, if an attacker knows or guesses your local subnet, he/she can establish connections directly to local hosts and cause a security threat.
For more detailed examples on how to build firewalls will be discussed in the firewall section.
Blocking Unwanted Websites
Sometimes you may want to block certain websites, for example, deny access to entertainment sites for employees, deny access to porn, and so on. This
can be achieved by redirecting HTTP traffic to a proxy server and use an access-list to allow or deny certain websites.
First, we need to add a NAT rule to redirect HTTP to our proxy. We will use RouterOS built-in proxy server running on port 8080.
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=dst-nat protocol=tcp dst-port=80 src-address=192.168.88.0/24 \
action=redirect to-ports=8080
```
Enable web proxy and drop some websites:
```
/ip proxy set enabled=yes
/ip proxy access add dst-host=www.facebook.com action=deny
/ip proxy access add dst-host=*.youtube.* action=deny
/ip proxy access add dst-host=:vimeo action=deny
```
Using Winbox:
```
On the left menu navigate to IP -> Web Proxy
Web proxy settings dialog will appear.
Check the "Enable" checkbox and click on the "Apply" button
Then click on the "Access" button to open the "Web Proxy Access" dialog
```
```
In the "Web Proxy Access" dialog click on "+" to add a new Web-proxy rule
```
```
Enter Dst hostname that you want to block, in this case, "www.facebook.com", choose the
action "deny"
Then click on the "Ok" button to apply changes.
Repeat the same to add other rules.
```
Troubleshooting
RouterOS has built-in various troubleshooting tools, like ping, traceroute, torch, packet sniffer, bandwidth test, etc.
We already used the ping tool in this article to verify internet connectivity.
Troubleshoot if ping fails
The problem with the ping tool is that it says only that destination is unreachable, but no more detailed information is available. Let's overview the basic
mistakes.
You cannot reach [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) from your computer which is connected to a MikroTik device:
If you are not sure how exactly configure your gateway device, please reach MikroTik's official consultants for configuration support.


# Securing your router

## Overview
The following steps are a recommendation on how to additionally protect your device with already configured strong firewall rules.

## RouterOS version
Start by upgrading your RouterOS version. Some older releases have had certain weaknesses or vulnerabilities, that have been fixed. Keep your device
up to date, to be sure it is secure. Click "check for updates" in WinBox or WebFig, to upgrade. We suggest you follow announcements on our security
announcement blog to be informed about any new security issues.

## Access to a router

## Access username
Change the default username admin to a different name. A custom name helps to protect access to your router if anybody has direct access to your router:
```
/user add name=myname password=mypassword group=full
/user disable admin
```

## Access password
MikroTik routers require password configuration, we suggest using a password generator tool to create secure and non-repeating passwords. With a
secure password, we mean:
```
Minimum 12 characters;
Include numbers, Symbols, Capital and lowercase letters;
Is not a Dictionary Word or a Combination of Dictionary Words;
Note that quotes in the password require escaping;
```
```
/user set myname password="!={Ba3N!40TX+GvKBz?jTLIUcx/,"
```

## Securing access to the device
To prevent remote access to your device, there is a pre-configured firewall that blocks WAN (internet side) connections. This is intentional, please do not
remove these rules unless you're absolutely certain that the connection is secure.
If you intend to open remote access to your device, we recommend securing the connection using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as WireGuard.
A configuration guide for WireGuard VPN is available here.

## RouterOS MAC-access
RouterOS has built-in options for easy management access to network devices. The particular services should be shut down on production networks: MAC-
Telnet, MAC-WinBox, and MAC-Ping:
```
/tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=none
/tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=none
/tool mac-server ping set enabled=no
```

## Neighbor Discovery
MikroTik Neighbor discovery protocol is used to show and recognize other MikroTik routers in the network, and disable neighbor discovery on all interfaces:
```
/ip neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=none
```
Bandwidth server
A bandwidth server is used to test throughput between two MikroTik routers. Disable it in the production environment:
```
/tool bandwidth-server set enabled=no
```
DNS cache
A router might have DNS cache enabled, which decreases the resolving time for DNS requests from clients to remote servers. In case DNS cache is not
required on your router or another router is used for such purposes, disable it:
```
/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=no
```
Other clients services
RouterOS might have other services enabled (they are disabled by default RouterOS configuration). MikroTik caching proxy, socks, UPnP, and cloud
services:
```
/ip proxy set enabled=no
/ip socks set enabled=no
/ip upnp set enabled=no
/ip cloud set ddns-enabled=no update-time=no
```
More Secure SSH access
It is possible to enable more strict SSH settings (add aes-128-ctr and disallow hmac sha1 and groups with sha1) with this command:
```
/ip ssh set strong-crypto=yes
```
Router interface
Ethernet/SFP interfaces
It is good practice to disable all unused interfaces on your router, to decrease unauthorized access to your router:
```
/interface print
/interface set X disabled=yes
```
Where X numbers of unused interfaces.
LCD
Some RouterBOARDs have an LCD module for informational purposes, set a pin:
```
/lcd/pin/set pin-number=3659 hide-pin-number=yes
```
or disable it:
```
/lcd/set enabled=no
```

## Overview
MikroTik devices are preinstalled with RouterOS, so installation is usually not needed, except in the case where installing RouterOS on an x86 PC or
virtual instance CHR. The upgrade procedure on already installed devices is straightforward.

## Upgrading

## Version numbering
RouterOS versions are numbered sequentially when a period is used to separate sequences, it does not represent a decimal point, and the sequences do n
ot have positional significance. An identifier of 2.5, for instance, is not "two and a half" or "halfway to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the
second first-level revision. Therefore v5.2 is older than v5.18, which is newer.
RouterOS versions are released in several "release chains": Long term, Stable, Testing, and Development. When upgrading RouterOS, you can choose a
release chain from which to install the new packages.
```
Long term: Released rarely, and includes only the most critical fixes, upgrades within one number branch do not contain new features. When a Sta
ble release has been out for a while and seems to be stable enough, it gets promoted into the long-term branch, replacing an older release, which
is then moved to the archive. This consecutively adds new features.
Stable: Released every few months, including all tested new features and fixes.
Testing: Released every few weeks, only undergoes basic internal testing, and should not be used in production.
Development: Released when necessary. Includes raw changes and is available for software enthusiasts for testing new features.
```
Standard upgrade
The package upgrade feature connects to the MikroTik download servers and checks if there is another RouterOS version for your device under the
selected release channel. Can also be used for downgrading, if you, for example, are using stable release at the moment, but changed the release channel
to the long-term.
After clicking the Check For Updates button in QuickSet (or in the System → Packages menu) the Check For Updates window will open with the current or
the latest changelog (if a newer version exists). If newer version exists, buttons Download and Download&Install will appear. By cicking the Download
button a newest version will be downloaded (manual device reboot is required), by clicking Download&Install, download will start, and after a successful
download will reboot a device to install the downloaded packages.
The versions offered will depend on the selected release channel. Not all versions migh be available. It will not be possible to upgrade from an older
version to the latest version in one go, when using check-for-updates approach. For example, if running RouterOS v6.x, even selecting the major release
upgrade channel, called "Upgrade", you will only see v7.12.1 as the available version. You must first upgrade to that intermediate version and only then
newer releases will be available in the channels. This intermediate step can be done using check for updates too, but you will simply have to repeat check
for updates after the first update to the intermediate version.
If custom packages are installed, the downloader will take that into account and download all necessary packages.
```
It is strongly recommended to upgrade the bootloader after RouterOS update. To upgrade the bootloader, execute command "/system
routerboard upgrade" in CLI, followed by a reboot. Alternatively, navigate to the GUI System → RouterBOARD menu and click the "Upgrade"
button, then reboot the device.
```
You can automate the upgrade process by running a script in the system scheduler. This script queries the MikroTik upgrade servers for new versions, if
the response received says "New version is available", the script then issues the upgrade command below. Important note, this will not work, if you are
running it for the first time on a release that is older. It might not see latest versions as available, if you are running v6.x, you would first have to manually
select the "Upgrade" channel to do a major release upgrade to v7.12.1 intermediate version, and only afterwards newer v7 releases will be visible in the
upgrade channels.
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/system package update
check-for-updates once
:delay 3s;
:if ( [get status] = "New version is available") do={ install }
```
Manual upgrade
You can upgrade RouterOS in the following ways:
```
WinBox – drag and drop files to the Files menu
WebFig - upload files from the Files menu
FTP - upload files to the root directory
```
Manual upgrade process
```
First step - visit http://www.mikrotik.com and head to the Software page, then choose the architecture of the system you have the RouterOS installed on
(system architecture can be found in System → Resource section);
Download the routeros (main) and extra packages that are installed on a device;
Upload packages to a device using one of the previously mentioned methods:
```
Menu: /system/package/update install ignore-missing command allows upgrading only the RouterOS main package, while omitting packages that are
either missing or not uploaded during a manual upgrade process.
Using WinBox
Choose your system type, and download the upgrade package. Connect to your router with WinBox, Select the downloaded file with your mouse, and drag
it to the Files menu. If some files are already present, make sure to put the package in the root menu, not inside the hotspot folder! The upload will start.
```
It is strongly recommended to upgrade the bootloader after upgrading RouterOS. To upgrade the bootloader, execute command "/system
routerboard upgrade" in CLI, followed by a reboot. Alternatively, navigate to the GUI System → RouterBOARD menu and click the "Upgrade"
button, then reboot the device.
```
```
RouterOS cannot be upgraded through a serial cable. Only RouterBOOT is upgradeable using this method.
```
After it finishes - reboot the device. The New version number will be seen in the Winbox Title and in the Packages menu
Using FTP
```
Open your favorite SFTP program (in this case it is Filezilla), select the package, and upload it to your router (demo2.mt.lv is the address of my
router in this example). note that in the image I'm uploading many packages, but in your case - you will have one file that contains them all
if you wish, you can check if the file is successfully transferred onto the router (optional):
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/file print
Columns: NAME, TYPE, SIZE, CREATION-TIME
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
0 routeros-7.9-arm.npk package 13.0MiB may/18/2023 16:16:18
1 pub directory nov/04/2022 11:22:19
2 ramdisk directory jan/01/1970 03:00:24
```
```
reboot your router for the upgrade process to begin:
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/system reboot
Reboot, yes? [y/N]: y
```
after the reboot, your router will be up to date, you can check it in this menu:
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/system package print
```
if your router did not upgrade correctly, make sure you check the log
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/log print without-paging
RouterOS local upgrade
Sub-menu: system/package/local-update/
You can upgrade one or multiple MikroTik routers within your local network by using one device which have all needed packages. Feature is available from
7.17beta3 version in (system > packages local update) and will replace (system > auto update) feature. Here is a simple example with 3 routers (the same
method works on networks with infinite numbers of routers):
Place needed packages under Files menu, on your main router:
Optional, you can set mirror device between main one, if not needed, skip this step:
```
Choose Local Package Sources and enable Mirror device. Set Primary Server where the packages are located, 10.155.136.50. Check Interval min
imum setting can be set to 00:07:12, at which device will connect using Winbox to a main device and check for packages.
If new packages are available, it will begin to download, please note download process is slow and may require some time when large amount of
files are used. In case some failures, download will resume on next Check.
```
```
New "packs" folder is created, where mirror device will store packages:
```
Add new package source on device which will be updated, in this example we use mirror device 10.155.136.71:
Once you click Refresh in Local Update packages tab,  device using Winbox will try to connect to source and check if there are new packages.
Choose packages and click download, after download completes device will be needed to reboot for update.
```
Use system/package/local-update/refresh to automate this in your scripts and tools fetch url= can be used to download packages from our web
page, for example: tool/fetch url=https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/7.16.1/routeros-7.16.1-arm.npk
```
RouterOS upgrade using Dude
The Dude auto-upgrade
The dude application can help you to upgrade the entire RouterOS network with one click per router.
```
Set type RouterOS and correct password for any device on your Dude map, that you want to upgrade automatically,
Upload required RouterOS packages to Dude files
Upgrade the RouterOS version on devices from the RouterOS list. The upgrade process is automatic, after a click on upgrade (or force upgrade),
the package will be uploaded and the router will be rebooted by the Dude automatically.
```
The Dude hierarchical upgrade
For complicated networks, when routers are connected sequentially, the simplest example is "1router-2router-3router| connection. You might get an issue,
2router will go to reboot before packages are uploaded to the 3router. The solution is Dude Groups, the feature allows you to group routers and upgrade all
of them with one click!
```
Select the group and click Upgrade (or Force Upgrade),
```
License issues
When upgrading from older versions, there could be issues with your license key. Possible scenarios:
```
When upgrading from RouterOS v2.8 or older, the system might complain about an expired upgrade time. To override this, use Netinstall to
upgrade. Netinstall will ignore old license restrictions and will upgrade
When upgrading to RouterOS v4 or newer, the system will ask you to update the license to a new format. To do this, ensure your Winbox PC (not
the router) has a working internet connection without any restrictions to reach http://www.mikrotik.com and click "update license" in the license menu.
```
Netinstall
NetInstall is a widely-used installation tool for RouterOS. It runs on Windows systems or via a command-line tool, netinstall-cli, on Linux, or through Wine
(with superuser permissions required).
The NetInstall utilities can be downloaded from the MikroTik download section.
NetInstall is also used to re-install RouterOS in cases where a previous installation has failed, been damaged, or where access passwords have been lost.
To use NetInstall, your device must support booting from Ethernet, with a direct Ethernet connection between the NetInstall computer and the target
device. All RouterBOARDs support PXE network booting, which can be enabled in the RouterOS "routerboard" menu (if RouterOS is accessible) or in the
bootloader settings using a serial console cable.
Note: For RouterBOARD devices without a serial port or RouterOS access, you can activate PXE booting using the Reset button.
NetInstall can also directly install RouterOS onto a disk (USB/CF/IDE/SATA) connected to the NetInstall Windows machine. Once installed, simply transfer
the disk to the Router machine and boot from it.
Attention! Do not try to install RouterOS on your system drive. Action will format your hard drive and wipe out your existing OS.

## Summary
In RouterOS v7, most of the features are combined in one routeros (system) package.
Installing the corresponding package can enable specific features (like container, dude).
Packages are provided only by MikroTik, and no 3rd parties are allowed to make them.

## Acquiring packages
Packages can be downloaded from the MikroTik download page.

## RouterOS packages 
Starting from RouterOS 7.13, the routeros (system) package and one of the wireless packages are needed for the basic operation of a simple home router.
802.11ax WiFi APs require radio drivers, which are provided by the wifi-qcom package or (for RouterOS version before 7.13) the wifiwave2 package.
Previous generation WiFi APs require a wireless package.
Other packages are optional and not required for a home router. Install them only if you are sure of their purpose.
For an example, E50UG - hEX refresh uses ARM packages.

## Overview
This article describes a set of commands used for configuration management.

## Configuration Undo and Redo
Any action done in the GUI or any command executed from the CLI is recorded in /system history.  You can undo or redo any action by running undo
or redo commands from the CLI or by clicking on Undo, and Redo buttons from the GUI.
A simple example to demonstrate the addition of the firewall rule and how to undo and redo the action:
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> add chain=forward action=drop
```
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic
0 X chain=input action=drop protocol=icmp src-address=10.155.101.1 log=no
log-prefix=""
```
```
1 chain=forward action=drop
```
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> /system/history/print
Flags: U - undoable, R - redoable, F - floating-undo
Columns: ACTION, BY, POLICy
ACTION BY POLIC
F filter rule added admin write
U --- write
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter>
```
We have added a firewall rule and in /system history we can see all that was done.
Let's undo everything:
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> /undo
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic
0 X chain=input action=drop protocol=icmp src-address=10.155.101.1 log=no
log-prefix=""
```
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter>
```
As you can see firewall rule disappeared.
Now redo the last change:
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> /redo
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic
0 X chain=input action=drop protocol=icmp src-address=10.155.101.1 log=no
log-prefix=""
```
```
1 chain=forward action=drop
```
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /ip/firewall/filter>
```
System history is capable of showing exact CLI commands that will be executed during "Undo" or "Redo" actions even if we perform the action from GUI,
for example, detailed history output after adding TCP accept rule from WinBox:
```
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /system/history> print detail
Flags: U - undoable, R - redoable, F - floating-undo
F redo=
/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward disabled=no log=no \
log-prefix="" protocol=tcp
undo=/ip firewall filter remove *4 action="filter rule added" by="admin"
policy=write time=oct/10/2019 18:51:05
```
```
F redo=/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward
undo=/ip firewall filter remove *3 action="filter rule added" by="admin"
policy=write time=oct/10/2019 18:49:03
```
```
U redo="" undo="" action="---" by="" policy=write time=sep/27/2019 13:07:35
[admin@v7_ccr_bgp] /system/history>
```
Safe Mode
It is sometimes possible to change router configuration in a way that will make the router inaccessible (except from the local console). Usually, this is done
by accident, but there is no way to undo the last change when the connection to the router is already cut. Safe mode can be used to minimize such risk.
The "Safe Mode" button in the Winbox GUI allows you to enter Safe Mode, while in the CLI, you can access it by either using the keyboard shortcut F4 or
pressing [CTRL]+[X]. To exit without saving the made changes in CLI, hit [CTRL]+[D].
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip route>[CTRL]+[X]
[Safe Mode taken]
[admin@MikroTik] ip route<SAFE>
```
Message
Safe Mode taken is displayed and prompt changes to reflect that session is now in safe mode. All configuration changes that are made (also from other
login sessions), while the router is in safe mode, are automatically undone if the safe mode session terminates abnormally. You can see all such changes
that will be automatically undone and tagged with an F flag in the system history:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route>
[Safe Mode taken]
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route<SAFE> add
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route<SAFE> /system/history/print
Flags: U, F - FLOATING-UNDO
Columns:
ACTION, BY, POLICY ACTION BY POLICY
F route 0.0.0.0/0 added admin write
```
Now, if the telnet connection (or WinBox terminal) is cut, then after a while (TCP timeout is  9  minutes) all changes that were made while in safe mode will
be undone. Exiting session by [Ctrl]+[D] also undoes all safe mode changes, while /quit does not.
If another user tries to enter safe mode, he's given the following message:
```
[admin@MikroTik] >
Hijacking Safe Mode from someone - unroll/release/don't take it [u/r/d]:
```
```
[u] - undoes all safe mode changes, and puts the current session in safe mode.
[r] - keeps all current safe mode changes, and puts the current session in a safe mode. The previous owner of safe mode is notified about this:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall rule input
[Safe mode released by another user]
```
```
[d] - leaves everything as-is.
```
If too many changes are made while in safe mode, and there's no room in history to hold them all (currently history keeps up to 100 most recent actions),
then the session is automatically put out of the safe mode, and no changes are automatically undone. Thus, it is best to change the configuration in small
steps, while in safe mode. Pressing [Ctrl]+[X] twice is an easy way to empty the safe mode action list.
System Backup and Restore
System backup is the way to completely clone router configuration in binary format.
More information about Backup and Restore is found here.
Configuration Export and Import
RouterOS allows exporting and importing parts of the configuration in plain text format. This method can be used to copy bits of configuration between
different devices, for example, clone the whole firewall from one router to another.
An export command can be executed from each menu (resulting in configuration export only from this specific menu and all its sub-menus) or from the root
menu for complete config export and is available for CLI only.
Configuration Export
The following command parameters are accepted:
```
Property Description
```
```
compact Output only modified configuration, the default behavior
```
```
file Export configuration to a specified file. When the file is not specified export output will be printed
to the terminal
```
```
show-sensitive (yes|no; Default: no). RouterOS
version 7 only
```
```
hide-sensitive (yes|no; Default: no). RouterOS
version 6 only
```
```
Show sensitive information, like passwords, keys, etc.
```
```
Hide sensitive information, like passwords, keys, etc.
```
```
terse With this parameter, the export command will output only configuration parameters, without
defaults.
```
```
verbose With this parameter, the export command will output whole configuration parameters and items
including defaults.
```
For example, export configuration from /ip address the menu and save it to a file:
```
The Export command does not export system user passwords, installed certificates, SSH keys, Dude, or a User-manager database.
```
```
Installed certificates, Dude, and User-manager databases must be manually exported and imported into a new device.
```
```
System user passwords and user SSH keys can not be exported.
```
```
During config import, we suggest using the same RouterOS version used during config export to prevent cases when some of the commands do
not exist in one or another RouterOS version.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS NETWORK BROADCAST INTERFACE
0 10.1.0.172/24 10.1.0.0 10.1.0.255 bridge1
1 10.5.1.1/24 10.5.1.0 10.5.1.255 ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip address export file=address
[admin@MikroTik] > /file print
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
0 address.rsc script 315 dec/23/2003 13:21:48
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
By default, the export command writes only user-edited configuration, RouterOS defaults are omitted.
For example, the IPSec default policy will not be exported, and if we change one property then only our change will be exported:
```
[admin@rack1_b4] /ip ipsec policy> print
Flags: T - template, X - disabled, D - dynamic, I - inactive, * - default
0 T * group=default src-address=::/0 dst-address=::/0 protocol=all
proposal=default template=yes
[admin@rack1_b4] /ip ipsec policy> export
# apr/02/1970 17:59:14 by RouterOS 6.22
# software id = DB0D-LK67
#
[admin@rack1_b4] /ip ipsec policy> set 0 protocol=gre
[admin@rack1_b4] /ip ipsec policy> export
# apr/02/1970 17:59:30 by RouterOS 6.22
# software id = DB0D-LK67
#
/ip ipsec policy
set 0 protocol=gre
```

```
Starting from RouterOS 7.13, you can export parts of a specific menu. For instance, it is possible to export a specific address-list among multiple address-
lists on your router.
[admin@MikroTik] > ip firewall address-list export where list=mylist
Configuration Import
Root menu command import allows running configuration script from the specified file. Script file (with extension ".rsc") can contain any console command
including complex scripts.
For example, load saved configuration file
```
[admin@MikroTik] > import address.rsc
Opening script file address.rsc
```
```
Script file loaded and executed successfully
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
Import command allows to specify the following parameters:
```
Property Description
```
```
from-line Start executing the script from the specified line number. This option is only available in verbose mode.
```
```
file-name Name of the script (.rsc) file to be executed.
```
```
verbose Reads each line from the file and executes individually, allowing to debug syntax or other errors more easily.
```
```
dry-run Simulates the import without making any configuration changes. This helps in catching syntax errors. This option is only available in
verbose mode.
```
```
If some specific menu will not be able to respond to the export command, starting from the RouterOS v7.11, an error message will be printed
out in the export command output after a timeout ("#error exporting "/xxx" (timeout)") and the process will move on to the next menu.
```
```
If the device has a default or existing configuration that requires replacement, it is necessary to initiate a configuration reset.
```
```
This involves applying a clean, empty configuration using the command /system/reset-configuration no-defaults=yes, followed by a device
reboot.
```
Auto Import
It is also possible to automatically execute scripts after uploading to the router with FTP or SFTP. The script file must be named with the extension *.auto.
rsc. Once the commands in the file are executed, a new *.auto.log file is created which contains import success or failure information.
Import troubleshooting
Configuration parts to watch out for in exported .rsc files
Things that should be removed from export files that were created with "/export", before attempting import on a new device.
```
Interface renaming conflicts with the default ethernet naming scheme.
```
```
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=ether5 ] auto-negotiation=no name=ether1-gateway
set [ find default-name=ether6 ] name=ether2
set [ find default-name=ether7 ] name=ether3
set [ find default-name=ether8 ] name=ether4
set [ find default-name=ether1 ] name=ether5
set [ find default-name=ether2 ] name=ether6
set [ find default-name=ether3 ] name=ether7
set [ find default-name=ether4 ] name=ether8
```
```
In older versions "export" default entries might show with "add" instead of the "set" command. That should be edited before import to avoid errors.
Check if the total number of physical interfaces count matches the new and old devices. If there are some missing that will end up in error during.
rsc import.
```
In case of problematic import, attempt the following:
```
Use the dry-run parameter to simulate the import without making any configuration changes. This helps in catching syntax errors. This option is
only available in verbose mode.
Reset the configuration on that device.
Run the import command again with the "verbose=yes" argument. It will also stop the import process on a problem that you already encountered,
but will also show the place where the export failed. This way shows you the place where things need to be edited in the .rsc import file.
```
Startup delay
If your configuration relies on interfaces that might not yet have started up upon command execution, it is suggested to introduce delays or to monitor until
all needed interfaces are available. This example script allows you to set how many interfaces you are expecting, and how long to wait until they become
available:

### {
```
:local i 0
#Number of interfaces. It is necessary to reconfigure this number for each device (/interface print count-only)
:local x 10
#Max time to wait
:local t 30
while ($i < $t && [:len [/interface find]] < $x) do={
:put $i
:set $i ($i + 1)
:delay 1
}
if ($i = $t) do={
:log warning message="Could not load all physical interfaces"
} else={
#Rest of your script
}
}
```
```
".auto.rsc" in the filename is mandatory for a file to be automatically executed.
```
The above script will wait until there are 10 interfaces visible, or 30 seconds. If there are no 10 interfaces at this time, it will put a message in the log.
Modify the variables according to your needs.
Configuration Reset
RouterOS allows resetting configuration with /system reset-configuration command
This command clears all configuration of the router and sets it to the factory defaults including the login name and password ('admin' with an empty
password or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker). For more details on the default configuration see the list.
After executing the configuration reset command, the router will reboot and load the default configuration. Starting from version 7.13, following the reset, a
license prompt will be displayed with the option to view the end-user license agreement.
It is possible to override the default reset behavior with the parameters below:
```
Property Description
```
```
keep-
users
```
```
Do not remove existing users from the configuration
```
```
no-
defaults
```
```
Do not load the default configuration, just clear the configuration
```
```
skip-
backup
```
```
Skip automatic backup file generation before reset
```
```
run-after-
reset
```
```
Run specified .rsc file after reset. That way you can load your custom configuration.
```
For example hard reset configuration without loading default config and skipping backup file:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes
Dangerous! Reset anyway? [y/N]: y
```
And the same using Winbox:
```
The backup file of the existing configuration is stored before reset. That way you can easily restore any previous configuration if the reset is
done by mistake.
```
```
If the router was installed using Netinstall and had a script specified as the initial configuration, the reset command executes this script after
purging the configuration. To stop it from doing so, you will have to reinstall the router.
```
```
If a specific .rsc file execution takes more than 2 minutes, a script will fail, and LOG will contain "runtime limit exceeded" or in
rare cases "std failure: timeout" error.
```

AP Router
This type of configuration is applied to home access point routers to be used straight out of the box without additional configuration (except router
passwords and wireless keys)
First Ethernet is always configured as a WAN port (protected by a firewall, enabled DHCP client, and disabled MAC connection/discovery). Other Ethernet
ports and wireless interfaces are added to the local LAN bridge with 192.168.88.1/24 address set and configured DHCP server. In the case of dual-band
routers, one wireless is configured as a 5 GHz access point and the other as a 2.4 GHz access point.

## Overview
The console is used for accessing the MikroTik Router's configuration and management features using text terminals, either remotely using a serial port,
telnet, SSH, or console screen within Winbox, or directly using a monitor and keyboard. The console is also used for writing scripts. This manual describes
the general console operation principles. Please consult the Scripting Manual on some advanced console commands and on how to write scripts.

## Hierarchy
The console allows the configuration of the router's settings using text commands. Since there are a lot of available commands, they are split into groups
organized in a way of hierarchical menu levels. The name of a menu level reflects the configuration information accessible in the relevant section, eg. /ip
hotspot.
Example
For example, you can issue the /ip route print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip route print
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic,
C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,
B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit
# DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC G GATEWAY DIS INTE...
0 A S 0.0.0.0/0 r 10.0.3.1 1 bridge1
1 ADC 1.0.1.0/24 1.0.1.1 0 bridge1
2 ADC 1.0.2.0/24 1.0.2.1 0 ether3
3 ADC 10.0.3.0/24 10.0.3.144 0 bridge1
4 ADC 10.10.10.0/24 10.10.10.1 0 wlan1
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
Instead of typing /ip route path before each command, the path can be typed only once to move into this particular branch of the menu hierarchy. Thus, the
example above could also be executed like this:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip route
[admin@MikroTik] ip route> print
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic,
C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,
B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit #
DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC G GATEWAY DIS INTE...
0 A S 0.0.0.0/0 r 10.0.3.1 1 bridge1
1 ADC 1.0.1.0/24 1.0.1.1 0 bridge1
2 ADC 1.0.2.0/24 1.0.2.1 0 ether3
3 ADC 10.0.3.0/24 10.0.3.144 0 bridge1
4 ADC 10.10.10.0/24 10.10.10.1 0 wlan1 [
admin@MikroTik] ip route>
```
Notice that the prompt changes to reflect where you are located in the menu hierarchy at the moment. To move to the top level again, type " / "
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip route
[admin@MikroTik] ip route> /
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
To move up one command level, type " .. "
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip route> ..
[admin@MikroTik] ip>
```
You can also use / and .. to execute commands from other menu levels without changing the current level:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip route> /ping 10.0.0.1
10.0.0.1 ping timeout
2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat> .. service-port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
# NAME PORTS
0 ftp 21
1 tftp 69
2 irc 6667
3 h323
4 sip
5 pptp
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat>
```
Item Names and Numbers
Many of the command levels operate with arrays of items: interfaces, routes, users, etc. Such arrays are displayed in similarly looking lists. All items in the
list have an item number followed by flags and parameter values.
To change the properties of an item, you have to use the set command and specify the name or number of the item.
Item Names
Some lists have items with specific names assigned to each of them. Examples are interface or user levels. There you can use item names instead of item
numbers.
You do not have to use the print command before accessing items by their names, which, as opposed to numbers, are not assigned by the console
internally, but are properties of the items. Thus, they would not change on their own. However, there are all kinds of obscure situations possible when
several users are changing the router's configuration at the same time. Generally, item names are more "stable" than the numbers, and also more
informative, so you should prefer them to numbers when writing console scripts.
Item Numbers
Item numbers are assigned by the print command and are not constant - two successive print commands may order items differently. But the results of the
last print commands are memorized and, thus, once assigned, item numbers can be used even after add, remove, and move operations. Item numbers are
assigned on a per-session basis, they will remain the same until you quit the console or until the next print command is executed. Also, numbers are
assigned separately for every item list, so for example, the ip address print will not change the numbering of the interface list.
It is possible to use item numbers without running the print command. Numbers will be assigned just as if the print command was executed.
You can specify multiple items as targets for some commands. Almost everywhere, where you can write the number of item, you can also write a list of
numbers.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic, R - running
# NAME TYPE MTU
0 R ether1 ether 1500
1 R ether2 ether 1500
2 R ether3 ether 1500
3 R ether4 ether 1500
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set 0,1,2 mtu=1460
[admin@MikroTik] > interface print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic, R - running
# NAME TYPE MTU
0 R ether1 ether 1460
1 R ether2 ether 1460
2 R ether3 ether 1460
3 R ether4 ether 1500
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
Warning: Do not use Item numbers in scripts, it is not a reliable way to edit items in the scheduler. scripts, etc. Instead, use the "find" command. More info h
ere also look at scripting examples.
Quick Typing
Two features in the console help entering commands much quicker and easier - the [Tab] key completions, and abbreviations of command names.
Completions work similarly to the bash shell in UNIX. If you press the [Tab] key after a part of a word, the console tries to find the command within the
current context that begins with this word. If there is only one match, it is automatically appended, followed by a space:
/inte[Tab]_ becomes /interface _
If there is more than one match, but they all have a common beginning, which is longer than that of what you have typed, then the word is completed to
this common part, and no space is appended:
/interface set e[Tab]_ becomes /interface set ether_
If you've typed just the common part, pressing the tab key once has no effect. However, pressing it for the second time shows all possible completions in
compact form:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set e[Tab]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether[Tab]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether[Tab]_
ether1 ether5
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether_
```
The [Tab] key can be used almost in any context where the console might have a clue about possible values - command names, argument names,
arguments that have only several possible values (like names of items in some lists or name of protocol in firewall and NAT rules). You cannot complete
numbers, IP addresses, and similar values.
Another way to press fewer keys while typing is to abbreviate command and argument names. You can type only the beginning of the command name,
and, if it is not ambiguous, the console will accept it as a full name. So typing:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > pin 10.1 c 3 si 100
```
equals to:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ping 10.0.0.1 count 3 size 100
```
It is possible to complete not only the beginning, but also any distinctive substring of a name: if there is no exact match, the console starts looking for
words that have string being completed as first letters of a multiple-word name, or that simply contain letters of this string in the same order. If a single
such word is found, it is completed at the cursor position. For example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface x[TAB][TAB]_
dot1x vxlan export
[admin@MikroTik] > interface mt[TAB]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface monitor-traffic _
```
General Commands
Some commands are common to nearly all menu levels, namely: print, set, remove, add, find, get, export, enable, disable, comment, and move. These
commands have similar behavior throughout different menu levels.
```
add - this command usually has all the same arguments as set, except the item number argument. It adds a new item with the values you have
specified, usually at the end of the item list, in places where the order of items is relevant. There are some required properties that you have to
supply, such as the interface for a new address, while other properties are set to defaults unless you explicitly specify them.
Common Parameters
copy-from - Copies an existing item. It takes the default values of a new item's properties from another item. If you do not want
to make an exact copy, you can specify new values for some properties. When copying items that have names, you will usually
have to give a new name to a copy
place-before - places a new item before an existing item with a specified position. Thus, you do not need to use the move
command after adding an item to the list.
disabled - controls disabled/enabled state of the newly added item(-s)
comment - holds the description of a newly created item
Return Values
add command returns the internal number of item it has added
edit - this command is associated with the set command. It can be used to edit values of properties that contain a large amount of text, such as
scripts, but it works with all editable properties. Depending on the capabilities of the terminal, either a fullscreen editor or a single-line editor is
launched to edit the value of the specified property. The edit field for console scripts is limited to 30 thousand characters.
find - The find command has the same arguments as set, plus the flag arguments like disabled or active that take values yes or no depending on
the value of the respective flag. To see all flags and their names, look at the top of the print command's output. The find command returns internal
numbers of all items that have the same values of arguments as specified.
move - changes the order of items in the list.
Parameters
first argument specifies the item(-s) being moved.
the second argument specifies the item before which to place all items being moved (they are placed at the end of the list if the
second argument is omitted).
print - shows all information that's accessible from a particular command level. Thus, /system clock print shows the system date and time, /ip route
print shows all routes, etc. If there's a list of items in the current level and they are not read-only, i.e. you can change/remove them (an example of
a read-only item list is /system history, which shows a history of executed actions), then print command also assigns numbers that are used by all
commands that operate with items in this list.
Common Parameters
from - show only specified items, in the same order in which they are given.
where - show only items that match specified criteria. The syntax of where the property is similar to the find command.
brief - forces the print command to use tabular output form
detail - forces the print command to use property=value output form
count-only - shows the number of items
file - prints the contents of the specific submenu into a file on the router.
interval - updates the output from the print command for every interval of seconds.
oid - prints the OID value for properties that are accessible from SNMP
without-paging - prints the output without stopping after each screenful.
remove - removes specified item(-s) from a list.
set - allows you to change values of general parameters or item parameters. The set command has arguments with names corresponding to
values you can change. Use "F1" or double [Tab] to see a list of all arguments. If there is a list of items in this command level, then "set" has one
action argument that accepts the number of item (or list of numbers) you wish to set up. This command does not return anything.
reset - reset parameters to default values
```
Modes
```
You can combine commands, here are two variants of the same command that will place a new firewall filter entry, by looking up the comment:
```
```
/ip firewall/filter/add chain=forward place-before=[find where comment=CommentX]
/ip/firewall/filter/add chain=forward place-before="CommentX"
```
The console line editor works either in multiline mode or in single-line mode. In multiline mode line editor displays the complete input line, even if it is
longer than a single terminal line. It also uses a full-screen editor for editing large text values, such as scripts. In single-line mode, only one terminal line is
used for line editing, and long lines are shown truncated around the cursor. A full-screen editor is not used in this mode.
The choice of modes depends on detected terminal capabilities.
Settings
In "/console/settings" menu, it is possible to enable option for replacing reserved characters with underscores for file name.

up, down and split keys leave the cursor at the end of the line.
Built-in Help
The console has built-in help. Press F1 for general console usage Help. The general rule is that Help shows what you can type in a position where the F1 w
as pressed (similarly to pressing [Tab] key twice, but in verbose form and with explanations).
Safe Mode
It is sometimes possible to change router configuration in a way that will make the router inaccessible (except from the local console). Usually, this is done
by accident, but there is no way to undo the last change when the connection to the router is already cut. Safe mode can be used to minimize such risk.
The "Safe Mode" button in the Winbox GUI allows you to enter Safe Mode, while in the CLI, you can access it by either using the keyboard shortcut F4 or
pressing [CTRL]+[X]. To exit without saving the made changes in CLI, hit [CTRL]+[D].
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip route>[CTRL]+[X]
[Safe Mode taken]
[admin@MikroTik] ip route<SAFE>
```
Message Safe Mode taken is displayed and prompt changes to reflect that session is now in safe mode. All configuration changes that are made (also
from other login sessions), while the router is in safe mode, are automatically undone if the safe mode session terminates abnormally. You can see all
such changes that will be automatically undone and tagged with an F flag in the system history:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route>
[Safe Mode taken]
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route<SAFE> add
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/route<SAFE> /system/history/print
Flags: U, F - FLOATING-UNDO
Columns: ACTION, BY, POLICY
ACTION BY POLICY
F route 0.0.0.0/0 added admin write
```
Now, if the telnet connection (or WinBox terminal) is cut, then after a while (TCP timeout is  9  minutes) all changes that were made while in safe mode will
be undone. Exiting session by [Ctrl]+[D] also undoes all safe mode changes, while /quit does not.
If another user tries to enter safe mode, he's given the following message:
```
[admin@MikroTik] >
Hijacking Safe Mode from someone - unroll/release/don't take it [u/r/d]:
```
```
[u] - undoes all safe mode changes, and puts the current session in safe mode.
```
```
[r] - keeps all current safe mode changes, and puts the current session in a safe mode. The previous owner of safe mode is notified about this:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall rule input
[Safe mode released by another user]
```
```
[d] - leaves everything as-is.
```
If too many changes are made while in safe mode, and there's no room in history to hold them all (currently history keeps up to 100 most recent actions),
then the session is automatically put out of the safe mode, and no changes are automatically undone. Thus, it is best to change the configuration in small
steps, while in safe mode. Pressing [Ctrl]+[X] twice is an easy way to empty the safe mode action list.
HotLock Mode
When HotLock mode is enabled commands will be auto-completed.
To enter/exit HotLock mode press F7.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/address> [F7]
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/address>>
```
```
Double>>is an indication that HotLock mode is enabled. For example, if you type "/in et", it will be auto-completed to
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/address>> /interface/ethernet/
```

The ":lock" command locks the screen.

# Reset Button

## Introduction
The RouterOS password can only be reset by reinstalling the RouterOS or using the reset button (or jumper hole) in case the hardware is RouterBOARD.
For X86(CHR) devices, only a complete reinstall will clear the password, along with any other configuration. For RouterBOARD devices, several methods
exist, depending on the device model.

## Reset From RouterOS
If you still have access to your router and want to recover its default configuration, then you can:
```
Run the command "/system reset-configuration" from a command-line interface;
```
```
Do it from the System -> Reset Configuration menu in the graphical user interface;
```

## Using Reset Button
RouterBOARD devices are fitted with a reset button which has several functions:
```
Loading the backup RouterBOOT loader
Hold this button before applying power, and release it after three seconds since powering, to load the backup boot loader. This might be
necessary if the device is not operating because of a failed RouterBOOT upgrade. When you have started the device with the backup loader, you
can either set RouterOS to force backup loader in the RouterBOARD settings or have a chance to reinstall the failed RouterBOOT from a ".fwf"
file (total of 3 seconds)
```
```
Resetting the RouterOS configuration
Hold this button until the LED light starts flashing, and release the button to reset RouterOS configuration to default.
```
```
Enabling CAPs mode
To connect this device to a wireless network managed by CAPsMAN, keep holding the button for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now
to turn on CAPs mode. It is also possible to enable CAPs mode via the command line, to do so run the command "/system reset-configuration
caps-mode=yes";
```
```
Starting the RouterBOARD in Netinstall mode
Or keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until the LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers. You
can also simply keep the button pressed until the device shows up in the Netinstall program on Windows.
```

## How to reset configuration
1) Unplug the device from power;
2) Press and hold the button right after applying power;
Note: hold the button until the LED will start flashing;
3) Release the button to clear the configuration;
```
You can also do the previous three functions without loading the backup loader, simply push the button immediately after you apply power. You
might need the assistance of another person to push the button and also plug in the power supply at the same time!
```
```
If you wait until the LED stops flashing, and only then release the button - this will instead launch Netinstall mode, to reinstall RouterOS.
```
Jumper hole reset
Older RouterBOARD models are also fitted with a reset jumper hole. Some devices might need an opening of the enclosure, RB750/RB951/RB751 have
the jumper hole under one of the rubber feet of the enclosure.
Close the jumper with a metal screwdriver, and boot the board until the configuration is cleared:
Jumper reset for older models
The below image shows the location of the Reset Jumper on older RouterBOARDs like RB133C:
WPS
Some devices have WPS button, or reset button with WPS functionality to reach and control access for Wireless networks without logging into the device,
so that client can connect without password. Specific models use WPS sync function to connect with each other. Detailed information on WPS and reset
button functionality for each model are described in User Manuals
```
Don't forget to remove the jumper after the configuration has been reset, or it will be reset every time you reboot!
```


# Backup

## Summary
The RouterOS backup feature allows cloning a router configuration in binary format, which can then be re-applied on the same device. The system's
backup file also contains the device's MAC addresses, which are restored when the backup file is loaded.
We recommend restoring the backup on the same version of RouterOS.

## Saving a backup
Sub-menu: /system backup save
```
Property Description
```
```
dont-encrypt (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Disable backup file encryption. Note that since RouterOS v6.43 without a provided password, the backup file is
unencrypted.
```
```
encryption (aes-sha256 | rc4;
Default: aes-sha256)
```
```
The encryption algorithm to use for encrypting the backup file. Note that is not considered a secure encryption
method and is only available for compatibility reasons with older RouterOS versions.
```
```
name (string; Default: [identity
]-[date]-[time].backup)
```
```
The filename for the backup file.
```
```
password (string; Default: ) Password for the encrypted backup file. Note that since RouterOS v6.43 without a provided password, the backup
file is unencrypted.
```
The backup file will be available under /file menu, which can be downloaded using FTP or using Winbox.

## Loading a backup
Load units backup without password:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/backup/load name=auto-before-reset.backup password=""
```
```
Property Description
```
```
name (string; Default: ) File name for the backup file.
```
```
password (string; Default: ) Password for the encrypted backup file.
```
```
If The Dude or User-manager or installed on the router, then the system backup will not contain configuration from these services, therefore,
additional care should be taken to save configuration from these services. Use the provided tool mechanisms to save/export configuration if you
want to save it.
```
```
System backups contain sensitive information about your device and its configuration, always consider encrypting the backup file and keeping
the backup file in a safe place.
```
```
If a password is not provided in RouterOS versions older than v6.43, then the backup file will be encrypted with the current user's password,
except if the dont-encrypted property is used or the current user's password is empty.
```
Example
To save the router's configuration to file test and a password:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup save name=test password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
Configuration backup saved
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup
```
To see the files stored on the router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /file print
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
0 test.backup backup 12567 sep/08/2018 21:07:50
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
To load the saved backup file test:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup load name=test
password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
Restore and reboot? [y/N]: y
Restoring system configuration
System configuration restored, rebooting now
```
Cloud backup
Since RouterOS v6.44 it is possible to securely store your device's backup file on MikroTik's Cloud servers, read more about this feature on the IP/Cloud pa
ge.


# Netinstall

## Introduction
Netinstall is a tool for installing and reinstalling MikroTik devices running RouterOS. Always try using Netinstall if you suspect that your device is not
working properly. The tool is available for Windows (with a graphical interface) and for Linux (as a command line tool).
In short, the Netinstall procedure goes like this: Connect your PC directly to the boot port (Usually Ether1, the port labeled BOOT or as otherwise indicated
in the product manual) of the device you will be reinstalling. Turn on the device while holding the reset button until it shows up in the Netinstall tool.

## Instructions for Windows
```
Download the Stable or Testing version of the Netinstall utility from the downloads page;
Download the RouterOS Main package from the downloads page;
```
```
Disable all computer network interfaces (WiFi, Ethernet, LTE, or any other type of connection) except for the one to be used for installation.
Netinstall will only function with one active interface on your computer. It's strongly recommended to deactivate any other network interfaces to
ensure Netinstall selects the correct one.
Configure a static IP address for your Ethernet interface, open Start, and select Settings:
```
```
Careful. Netinstall re-formats the system's drive, all configuration and saved files will be lost. Netinstall does not erase the RouterOS license
key, nor does it reset RouterBOOT related settings, for example, CPU frequency is not changed after reinstalling the device.
```
```
You need to select a RouterOS version, preferably one marked as Stable. Additionally, choose the appropriate architecture (ARM,
MIPS, SMIPS, TILE, etc.). If unsure, you can download the RouterOS package for all architectures, and Netinstall will determine the
correct one for your device.
```
```
Open Network & Internet and select Change adapter options
```
Netinstall can run also on a local network, in such case you could skip setting a static IP address, but it is highly recommended that you set a
static IP address if you are not familiar with Netinstall.
Right-click on your Ethernet interface and select Properties
Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties
Check Use the following IP address and fill out the fields as shown in the image below
Open your Downloads folder (or wherever you saved the downloaded files) and extract the Netinstall *.zip file to a convenient place
```
Make sure that the Ethernet interface is running and launch Netinstall.exe. If you followed the guide precisely, then you should not have any
Internet connection on your computer, Windows 10 wants to verify all apps that it runs, but will not be able to do it since lack of an Internet
connection, for this reason, a warning might pop up, you should click Run.
```
```
Allow access for Netinstall in Public networks and configure Net booting settings and fill out the required fields as shown in the image below
```
Netinstall requires administrator rights, there should be a window asking for permissions to run Netinstall, you must accept these permissions in
order for Netinstall to work properly.
```
Connect your device to your computer using an ethernet cable directly (without any other devices in-between), plug the Ethernet cable into your
device's Etherboot port (see the next "Warning" in this article before connecting your Netinstll network).
MikroTik devices are able to use Netinstall from their first port (Ether1), or from the port marked with "BOOT".
```
The Client IP address must be unique! Don't use an existing IP address in your network, this also means that you should not use the computer's
IP address as well. Use a completely different IP address from the same subnet.
```
Power up your device and put it into etherboot mode
```
```
Wait for the device to show up in Netinstall, then select it and click Browse. Navigate to your Downloads folder (or wherever you saved your
RouterOS packages) and press OK.
```
Some computers have a network interface (especially USB Ethernet adapters) that tend to create an extra link flap, which is enough for
Netinstall to fail to detect a device that is in Etherboot mode. In such a case you can use a switch between your device and your computer or a
router in bridge mode to prevent this issue. If you use RouterOS powered router in bridge mode, then make sure that you disable any DHCP
clients on the router bridge interface and disable Detect Internet feature.
Netinstall uses bootp packets, which are using the same port numbers as DHCP packets. If you're using a switch between your PC and the
device to be Netinstalled, ensure that the ports in the bridge are not blocked by other network devices.
If you have dhcp-snooping enabled, make sure to enable "trusted" on the bridge ports facing the Netinstall PC.
There are multiple ways how to put your device into Etherboot mode. Make sure you read the Etherboot manual before trying to put the device
into this mode. Methods vary between different MikroTik devices.
```
Select your desired RouterOS packages and press Install. Wait for the installation to finish and press "Reboot" (Devices without serial console
have to be rebooted manually).
```
If you have downloaded RouterOS packages for multiple architectures, Netinstall will only display the appropriate architecture packages for your
device after you have selected it. Unsupported packages will not appear in this window once a device is selected.
If the installation does not start (progress bar is not moving or no status is shown), then you can try closing the Netinstall application and opening it
up again or try to put the device into Etherboot mode again. If you are still unable to get Netinstall working, then you should try using it on a different
computer since there might be an operating system's issue that is preventing Netinstall from working properly.
After using Netinstall the device will be reset to defaults (unless you specified not to apply default configuration). Some devices are not accessible through e
ther1 port with the default configuration for security reasons. Read more about Default configuration.
Option "Keep branding" allows you to retain the device's already installed branding package without reinstalling it using Netinstall.
```
You're all set! Configure your device and reconnect it to your network. Your device should now be functioning correctly!
```
Instructions for Linux
The Linux version is a command line tool, which offers nearly the same parameters as the Windows counterpart.
Download the tool from our download page (links not literal):
wget https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/[VERSION]/netinstall-[VERSION].tar.gz
Extract it:
tar -xzf netinstall-[VERSION].tar.gz
Run the tool:
sudo ./netinstall-cli [-parameters] [address/interface] routeros-arm64-[package VERSION].npk
```
The "Keep old configuration" process involves downloading the configuration database from the router, reinstalling the router (including disk
formatting), and uploading the configuration files back to it. However, it's important to note that this process solely applies to the configuration
itself and does not impact the files, including databases like the User Manager database, Dude database, and others.
```
```
When using the Configure script option, it is suggested to introduce a delay before configuration execution.
```
```
The tool requires privileged access and must be run as root, use sudo.
```
The available parameters are as follows:
```
Parameter Meaning
```
```
-r When the reinstallation process is performed, the current configuration will be reset, and for devices that have it, the default configuration
will be applied (optional).
```
```
-e Performing the reinstallation process will reset the device to an empty configuration.
```
```
-b Option to discard the currently installed branding package from the device, otherwise it will be reinstalled together with RouterOS.
```
```
-o When using the netinstall tool with the "-o" option, devices can only be installed once per netinstall run. This means that during the
netinstall process, the tool will keep track of the MAC addresses of devices that were successfully installed. If a device with the same
MAC address tries to reinstall during the same run, the tool will ignore it and not respond to its bootp requests.
```
```
-k keyfile Provides the device with a license key in .KEY format (optional).
```
```
-s userscript Pre-configures the device with the provided configuration (text file in .RSC format). This configuration also takes place of the default
configuration. The script can access factory passwords with read-only variables $defconfPassword and $defconfWifiPassword (starting
from RouterOS 7.10beta8) (optional).
```
```
-a IP Uses a specific IP address that the Netinstall server will assign to the device. Mandatory, but can be auto-assigned if interface parameter
used.
```
```
PACKAGE Specify a list of RouterOS.NPK format packages that Netinstall will try to install on the device (mandatory). The system package must be
listed first.
```
```
-i Allows you to specify an interface (optional).
```
First make sure you have set the IP on your computer's interface:
```
admin@ubuntu:~$ sudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.88.2/24
```
Then run the Netinstall version 6 (an example that resets the configuration upon reinstallation procedure):
```
admin@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./netinstall -r -a 192.168.88.3 routeros-mipsbe-6.48.1.npk
Using server IP: 192.168.88.2
Starting PXE server

Sending image: mips
Discovered RouterBOARD...
Formatting...
Sending package routeros-mipsbe-6.48.1.npk ...
Ready for reboot...
Sent reboot command
```
Or run the Netinstall version 7 (an example that applies an empty configuration and discards the branding during the reinstallation procedure):
```
If the "-r" or "e-" parameter is not specified, netinstall-cli will reinstall RouterOS  and will keep the current configuration by downloading current
configuration database from the router, reinstalling the router (including disk formatting), and uploading the configuration back to it, the same
as  Netinstall "Keep old configuration" option. However, it's important to note that this process solely applies to the configuration itself and does
not impact the files, including databases like the User Manager database, Dude database, and others.
```
```
admin@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./netinstall-cli -e -b -i enx1234567ee890 -a 192.168.88.3 routeros-7.14.2-arm.npk wireless-

Etherboot
Etherboot mode is a special state for a MikroTik device that allows you to reinstall your device using Netinstall. There are two types of booters available for
use: the regular booter and the backup booter. It's essential to verify both options.
```
To use the Regular booter press Ctrl+E to enter etherboot mode using the serial console or press the Reset button after a 1-2 second delay from
when you power it on.
To employ the backup booter, power OFF the device. Press the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USR" led is blinking then
stable "On", and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS using
Netinstall.
```
Reset button
The Reset can be found on all MikroTik devices, this button can be used to put the device into Etherboot mode. An easy way to put a device into Etherboot
mode using the Reset button is by powering off the device, hold the Reset button, power on the device while holding the Reset button and keep holding it
until the device shows up in your Netinstalll window.
RouterOS
If your device is able to boot up and you are able to log in, then you can easily put the device into Etherboot mode. To do so, just connect to your device
and execute the following command:
```
/system routerboard settings set boot-device=try-ethernet-once-then-nand
```
After that either reboot the device or do a power cycle on the device. Next time the device will boot up, then it will first try going into Etherboot mode. Note
that after the first boot up, the device will not try going into Etherboot mode and will boot directly from NAND or from the storage type the device is using.
Serial console
Some devices come with a serial console that can be used to put the device into Etherboot mode. To do so, make sure you configure your computer's
serial console. The required parameters for all MikroTik devices (except for RouterBOARD 230 series) are as following:
```
115200bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, flow control=none by default.
```
For RouterBOARD 230 series devices the parameters are as following:
```
9600bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control by default.
```
Make sure you are using a proper null modem cable, you can find the proper pinout here. When the device is booting up, keep pressing CTRL+E on your
keyboard until the device shows that it is trying bootp protocol:
```
If you have set up a Protected bootloader, then the reset button's behavior is changed. Make sure you remember the settings you used to set up
the Protected bootloader, otherwise you will not be able to use Eterboot mode and will not be able to reset your device.
```
```
RouterBOOT booter 7.14.2
```
```
CRS328-4C-20S-4S+
```
```
CPU frequency: 800 MHz
Memory size: 512 MiB
Storage size: 16 MiB
```
```
Press Ctrl+E to enter etherboot mode
Press any key within 2 seconds to enter setup
trying bootp protocol.... OK
Got IP address: 192.168.88.3
resolved mac address 84:69:93:9E:E6:49
transfer started ............................... transfer ok, time=2.00s
```
At this point your device is in Etherboot mode, now the device should show up in your Netinstall window.


# Supout.rif

## What is supout.rif file?
The support file is used for debugging MikroTik RouterOS and to solve the support questions faster. All MikroTik Router information is saved in a binary
file, which is stored in the router and can be downloaded from the router using FTP or WinBox. If required, then you can generate the file on the "/flash"
folder on devices with FLASH type memory or external storage drive, by specifying the full path to the file "name=flash/supout.rif". You can view the
contents of this file in your Mikrotik account, simply click on "Supout.rif viewer" located in the left column and upload the file.
This file contains all your router's configuration, logs, and some other details that will help MikroTik Support to solve your issue. The file does not contain
sensitive information or router passwords.

## Creating a Support Output file

## Winbox
To generate this file in Winbox, click on "Make Supout.rif".
To save the file to your computer, right mouse click on the file and select "Download" to get support output file or simply drag the file to your desktop.

## Webfig
To generate this file in Webfig, click on "Make Supout.rif" and then "Download" to get it on your computer.
Console
To generate this file, please type in the command line:
```
/system sup-output name=supout.rif
```
If you open the file on supout viewer and output is too narrow, then you can re-generate supout file and specify output width manually with output-width
option:
```
/system sup-output name=supout.rif output-width=300
```

```

## Overview
```
MikroTik hardware routers that run RouterOS come preinstalled with a RouterOS license, if you have
purchased a RouterOS based device, nothing must be done regarding the license.
```
```
For X86 systems (i.e. PC devices), you need to obtain a license key. Each x86 system has a unique
identifier called Software ID, which is used for licensing.
```
```
The license key is a block of symbols that needs to be copied from your mikrotik.com account, or from
the email you received in, and then it can be pasted into the router. You can paste the key anywhere in
the terminal, or by clicking "Paste key" in WinBox License menu. A reboot is required for the key to take
effect.
```
```
Licensing information can be read from CLI system console:
```
```
[admin@RB1100] > /system license print
software-id: "43NU-NLT9"
nlevel: 6
features:
[admin@RB1100] >
```
```
or from equivalent WinBox,  WebFig menu.
```
```
RouterOS licensing scheme is based on Software-ID / System-ID where:
```
```
RouterBOARD software-id is bound to storage media (HDD, NAND).
x86 software-id is bound to MBR
CHR system-id is bound to MBR and UUID
```
```
Before the license purchase it is recommended to check if the Software ID does not change
on reboot. (Software ID may change on defective HDD, on HDD where RAID controllers are
used but not properly configured etc.)
```


# RouterOS license key levels
After installation RouterOS runs in trial mode. You have 24 hours to register for Level 1 (Free demo) or purchase a Level 4,5 or 6 license and paste a
valid key.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /system license> print
software-id: TRPC-YYR2
expires-in: 23h48m24s
```
Level 3 is a wireless station (client or CPE) only license. For x86 PCs, Level3 is not available for purchase individually.
Level 2 was a transitional license from old legacy (pre 2.8) license format. These licenses are not available any more, if you have this kind of license, it
will work, but to upgrade it - you will have to purchase a new license.
The difference between license levels is shown in the table below:
```
Level number 0 (Trial mode) 1 (Free Demo) 3 (WISP CPE) 4 (WISP) 5 (WISP) 6 (Controller)
```
```
Price no key registration required not for sale $45 $95 $250
```
```
Wireless AP mode (PtMP) 24h trial - no yes yes yes
```
```
PPPoE tunnels 24h trial 1 200 200 500 unlimited

```
```
Bonding interfaces 24h trial 1 unlimited unlimited unlimited unlimited
```
```
RADIUS 24h trial - unlimited unlimited unlimited unlimited
```
All Licenses:
```
never expire (a running and licensed router can be used indefinitely)
can use unlimited number of interfaces
are for one installation each
offer unlimited software upgrades (exception - demo license does not allow ROS version upgrade (started from 7.8))
```

## CHR License Levels
License levels described until now do not apply to Cloud Hosted Routers (CHRs). CHR is a RouterOS version intended for running as a virtual
machine. It has its own 4 license levels as well as trial where you can test any of the paid license levels for 60 days.
60-day free trial license is available for all paid license levels. To get the free trial license, you have to have an account on MikroTik.com as all license
management is done there.
Perpetual is a lifetime license (buy once, use forever). It is possible to transfer a perpetual license to another CHR instance. A running CHR instance
will indicate the time when it has to access the account server to renew it's license. If the CHR instance will not be able to renew the license it will
behave as if the trial period has ran out and will not allow an upgrade of RouterOS to a newer version.
After licensing a running trial system, you must manually run the /system license renew command from the CHR to make it active. Otherwise the
system will not know you have licensed it in your account. If you do not do this before the system deadline time, the trial will end and you will have to
do a complete fresh CHR installation, request a new trial and then license it with the license you had obtained.

enforced limitations.
```
```
60-day
Trial
```
```
FREE In addition to the limited Free installation, you can also test the increased speed of P1/P10/PU licenses with a 60 trial.
```
```
You will have to have an account registered on MikroTik.com. Then you can request the desired license level for trial from
your router that will assign your router ID to your account and enable a purchase of the license from your account. All the
paid license equivalents are available for trial. A trial period is 60 days from the day of acquisition, after this time passes,
your license menu will start to show "Limited upgrades", which means that RouterOS can no longer be upgraded.
```
```
Note that if you plan to purchase the selected license, you must do it before 60 days trial ends. If your trial has ended, and
there are no purchases within 2 months, the device will no longer appear in your MikroTik account. You will have to make a
new CHR installation to make a purchase within the required time frame.
```
```
To request a trial license, you must run the command "/system license renew" from the CHR device command line.
You will be asked for the username and password of your mikrotik.com account.
```

## Prepaid Key
A Prepaid Key is a type of license key you can purchase in advance for MikroTik products, such as the CHR, or convert into a license key to apply to
an x86 system's Software ID. It allows you to buy a license without immediately assigning it to a specific device. Once you have a Prepaid Key, you
can use it to upgrade a CHR or later convert it into a license key by providing the device's Software ID.

Replacement Key
A Replacement Key is a special key issued by the MikroTik support team in case of an x86 HDD failure or if an x86 instance running RouterOS has
lost its license. It costs $10 and can be issued once per original key.
Note that before issuing such key, MikroTik Support can ask you to prove that the old drive has failed, in some cases, this means sending us the dead
drive.
Replacement key request
1) Go to your account management in mikrotik.com and fill the "support contact form" or write a direct e-mail to support@mikrotik.com
```
Please provide detailed information about why replacement key is required
```
2) Send required info to MikroTik support department.
3) Re-check your account after support staff has confirmed that replacement key has been added to your account. Select the section "Make a key
from replacement key"
4) Select the appropriate license level on which you wish to perform the replacement
5) Enter the new "software-ID"
6) Proceed to checkout by pressing "Add license replacement to cart" and finish the payment
7) An e-mail will be sent to your profile containing the new license.
```
You can also find the newly generated key in the section "Search and view all keys" under the folder "Purchased YYYY" where "YYYY" is the
current Year
```
Obtaining Licenses and Working With Them
```
We may issue only one replacement key per one original key, using replacement key procedure twice for one key will not be possible. In
cases like this new key for this RouterOS device must be purchased.
```
Where can I buy a RouterOS license key?
MikroTik devices come preinstalled with a license and no purchase is needed.
To obtain a higher level license, or to obtain a license for a x86 PC installation, you must register an account on our webpage, and in there, use the
option Purchase a RouterOS license key.
If I have purchased my key elsewhere
You must contact the company who sold you the license, they will provide the support.
If I have a license and want to put it on another account?
You can give access to keys with the help of Virtual Folders
The only kind of licenses, that could be transferred to another Account is a prepaid key. Prepaid keys got as a gift from the Training are not
transferable.
To transfer purchased prepaid key navigate to "Transfer prepaid keys" in the section "ROUTEROS KEYS" on your MikroTik Account.
If I have lost a license on my device?
If for some reason you have lost license from your router, upgrade router to the latest RouterOS version available and use "Request license key" in
your mikrotik.com account. Use soft-id and serial number available under System/License menu in RouterOS when requesting license. Apply received
license or contact support@mikrotik.com if request feature do not work.
Using the License
Can I Format or Re-Flash the drive?
Formatting, and Re-Imaging the drive with non-MikroTik tools (like DD and Fdisk) will destroy your license! Be very careful and contact MikroTik
support before doing this. It is not recommended, as MikroTik support might deny your request for a replacement license. For this use MikroTik
provided tools - Netinstall or CD-install that are freely available from our download page.
How many computers can I use the License on?
The RouterOS license can be used only in one system, at the same time. The License is bound to the HDD it is installed on, but you have the ability to
move the HDD to another computer system. You cannot move the License to another HDD, neither can you format or overwrite the HDD with the
RouterOS license. It will be erased from the drive, and you will have to get a new one. If you accidentally removed your license, contact the support
team for help.
Can I temporary use the HDD for something else, other than RouterOS?
As stated above, no.
Can I move the license to another HDD?
If your current HDD drive is destroyed, or can no longer be used, it is possible to transfer the license to another HDD. You will have to request a
replacement key (see below) which will cost 10$
Must I type the whole key into the router?
No, simply copy it and paste in the menu System → License → Paste Key and Confirm to reboot.
```
If the license was lost due to repairs and they were not done via the distributor under warranty, you will have to purchase a new RouterOS
license for the full price!
```
Or paste it to the CLI and press "Y" to reboot.
Can I install another OS on my drive and then install RouterOS again later?
No, because if you use formatting, partitioning utilities or tools that do something to the MBR, you will lose the license and you will have to make a new
one. This process is not free (see Replacement Key above)
I lost my RouterBOARD, can you give me the license to use on another system?
MikroTik hardware comes with an embedded license. You cannot move this license to a new system in any way, this includes any upgrades applied to
the MikroTik router while it was still working.
Licenses Purchased from Resellers
The keys that you purchase from other vendors and resellers are not in your account. Your mikrotik.com account only contains licenses purchased
from MikroTik directly.
I am not using the software, can you terminate my license?
The licenses are stand alone keys and MikroTik does not have any remote control over your devices. Therefore, we are unable to verify if you use
your license or not. This is why MikroTik cannot terminate any issued licenses.
Is this possible to upgrade or transfer my x86 license to a CHR license
It is not possible to upgrade the x86 license to a CHR license. You will need to purchase a new license for the CHR.

Cloud Hosted Router (CHR) is a RouterOS version intended for running as a virtual machine. It supports the x86 64-bit architecture and can be used on
most of the popular hypervisors such as VMWare, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, KVM, and others. CHR has full RouterOS features enabled by default but has a
different licensing model than other RouterOS versions.

## System Requirements
```
Package version: RouterOS v6.34 or newer
Host CPU: 64-bit with virtualization support
RAM: 256MB or more (Max: 128GB)
Disk: 128MB disk space for the CHR virtual hard drive (Max: 16GB)
```
The minimum required RAM depends on interface count and CPU count. You can get an approximate number by using the following formula:
```
RouterOS v6 - RAM = 128 + [ 8 × (CPU_COUNT) × (INTERFACE_COUNT - 1) ]
RouterOS v7 - RAM = 512 + [ 8 × (CPU_COUNT) × (INTERFACE_COUNT - 1) ]
```
Note: We recommend allocating at least 1024MiB of RAM for CHR instances.

## CHR has been tested on the following platforms:
```
VirtualBox 6 on Linux and OS X
VMWare Fusion 7 and 8 on OS X
```

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

Note: SCSI controller Hyper-V and ESX are usable just for secondary disks, system image must be used with IDE controller!
Warning: We do not recommend using the E1000 network interface if better synthetic interface options are available on a specific Hypervisor!
How to Install a virtual RouterOS system with CHR images
We provide 4 different virtual disk images to choose from. Note that they are only disk images, and you can't simply run them.
```
RAW disk image (.img file)
VMWare disk image (.vmdk file)
Hyper-V disk image (.vhdx file)
VirtualBox disk image (.vdi file)
```
Steps to install CHR
```
Download the virtual disk image for your hypervisor
Create a guest virtual machine
Use the previously downloaded image file as a virtual disk drive
Start the guest CHR virtual machine
Log in to your new CHR. The default user is 'admin', without a password
```
Please note that running CHR systems can be cloned and copied, but the copy will be aware of the previous trial period, so you cannot extend your trial
time by making a copy of your CHR. However, you are allowed to license both systems individually. To make a new trial system, you need to make a fresh
installation and reconfigure RouterOS.

CHR Licensing
The CHR (Cloud Hosted Router) has 4 license levels:
```
free
p1 perpetual-1 ($45)
p10 perpetual-10 ($95)
p-unlimited perpetual-unlimited ($250)
```
The 60-day free trial license is available for all paid license levels. To get the free trial license, you have to have an account on MikroTik.com as all license
management is done there.
Perpetual is a lifetime license (buy once, use forever). It is possible to transfer a perpetual license to another CHR instance. A running CHR instance will
indicate the time when it has to access the account server to renew its license. If the CHR instance will not be able to renew the license it will behave as if
the trial period has run out and will not allow an upgrade of RouterOS to a newer version.
After licensing a running trial system, you must manually run the /system license renew function from the CHR to make it active. Otherwise, the system will
not know you have licensed it in your account. If you do not do this before the system deadline time, the trial will end and you will have to do a complete
fresh CHR installation, request a new trial, and then license it with the license you had obtained.
```
License Speed limit Price
```
```
Free 1Mbit FREE
```
```
P1 1Gbit $45
```
```
P10 10Gbit $95
```
```
P-Unlimited Unlimited $250
```
Paid licenses
p1
p1 (perpetual-1) license level allows CHR to run indefinitely. It is limited to 1Gbps upload per interface. All the rest of the features provided by CHR are
available without restrictions. It is possible to upgrade from P1 to P10 or P-Unlimited. Once the upgrade is purchased at the full price, the former license
will become available for later use on your account.
p10
p10 (perpetual-10) license level allows CHR to run indefinitely. It is limited to 10Gbps upload per interface. All the rest of the features provided by CHR are
available without restrictions. It is possible to upgrade from P10 to P-Unlimited. Once the upgrade is purchased at the full price, the former license will
become available for later use on your account.
p-unlimited
The p-unlimited (perpetual-unlimited) license level allows CHR to run indefinitely. It is the highest-tier license and it has no enforced limitations.
Free licenses
There are several options to use and try CHR free of charge.
free
The free license level allows CHR to run indefinitely. It is limited to 1Mbps upload per interface. All the rest of the features provided by CHR are available
without restrictions. To use this, all you have to do is download the disk image file from our download page and create a virtual guest.
60-day trial
In addition to the limited Free installation, you can also test the increased speed of P1/P10/PU licenses with a 60 trial.
You will have to have an account registered on MikroTik.com. Then you can request the desired license level for trial from your router that will assign your
router ID to your account and enable the purchase of the license from your account. All the paid license equivalents are available for trial. A trial period is
60 days from the day of acquisition after this time passes, your license menu will start to show "Limited upgrades", which means that RouterOS can no
longer be upgraded.
If you plan to purchase the selected license, you should do it within 60 days of the trial end date. If your trial ends, and there are no purchases within 2
months after it ended, the device will no longer appear in your MikroTik account. You will have to make a new CHR installation to make a purchase within
the required time frame.

To request a trial license, you must run the command "/system license renew" from the CHR device command line. You will be asked for the username
and password of your mikrotik.com account.
An expired CHR license means the CHR instance failed to renew its license before the "deadline-at" date by contacting the MikroTik server. While the
router continues operating at the same tier, software updates are disabled.
It is only possible to license an expired CHR instance using a Prepaid key.
Prepaid Key
A Prepaid Key is a type of license key you can purchase in advance for MikroTik products, such as the CHR, or convert into a license key to apply to an
x86 system's Software ID. It allows you to buy a license without immediately assigning it to a specific device. Once you have a Prepaid Key, you can use it
to upgrade a CHR or later convert it into a license key by providing the device's Software ID.
How to Purchase a Prepaid Key to License a CHR
```
Go to mikrotik.com and log in to your account.
Access the "Purchase a RouterOS License Key" Section.
Choose the desired license Key Level;
Select Key Type.
Select the key type: "Prepaid key";
Input the quantity of prepaid keys you wish to purchase;
Select Optional Key Features:
Choose any additional features you might need for your key.
Press the "Place key in the cart" button.
Click "Proceed to checkout" to complete your purchase.
```
```
If you plan to use multiple virtual systems of the same kind, it may be possible that the next machine has the same system ID as the original
one. This can happen on certain cloud providers, such as Linode. To avoid this, after your first boot, run the command "/system license
generate-new-id" before you request a trial license. Note that this feature must be used only while CHR is running on a free type of RouterOS
license. If you have already obtained a paid or trial license, do not use the regenerate feature since you will not be able to update your current
key anymore
```
```
IP/Cloud requires a paid perpetual license for Cloud Hosted Router (CHR).

Congratulations! You have successfully purchased a Prepaid Key.
Getting and Upgrading the License
After the initial setup, a CHR instance will be assigned a free trial license. You can upgrade this license to a higher tier through your MikroTik account. All
license management, including upgrades, is handled on the account server.
Initial Upgrade from Free to P1 License Level or Higher
Initial upgrade from the free tier to anything higher than that incurs CHR instance registration on the account server.
To do that you have to enter your MikroTik.com username and password and the desired license level you want to acquire.
To upgrade from the free tier to a higher license level, you need to register the CHR instance on the account server. Enter your MikroTik username and
password, then select the desired license level to complete the upgrade.
As a result, a CHR System ID will be assigned to your account on the account server, and a 60-day trial will be created for that System ID. There are two
ways to obtain a license: using WinBox or the RouterOS command-line interface.
Upgrade license level using WinBox
(System -> License menu):
```
Note that you can upgrade to any tier except for p-unlimited, which is already the highest tier.
```
Upgrade license level using the command-line interface
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system license print
system-id: 6lR1ZP/utuJ
level: free
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/license/renew
account: mymikrotikcomaccount
password: *********************
level: p1
status: done
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system/license/print
system-id: 6lR1ZP/utuJ
level: p1
limited-upgrades: no
next-renewal-at: 2024-08-25 13:18:06
deadline-at: 2024-09-24 13:18:06
```
Payment
To acquire a higher-level trial, set up a new CHR instance, renew the license, and select the desired level.
To upgrade from a Trial license to a Paid one, go to the MikroTik account server and choose "All CHR keys" in the "CHR LICENCES" section.
The list of your CHR instances and their corresponding licenses will be displayed.
To upgrade from a Trial to a Paid license, click "Upgrade," select the desired license level (which can differ from the trial license level), and click "Upgrade"
button.
If there are Prepaid keys available, it is possible to use it for CHR - press "Pay using Prepaid key". If there are no Prepaid keys or you do not want to use
them, press "Proceed to checkout".
Choose the payment method: It is possible to pay using a credit card (CC) or PayPal.
License Update
In the System-License menu, the router will indicate "next-renewal-at" - the time when it will reattempt to contact the server located on licence.mikrotik.com.
Communication attempts will be performed once an hour after the date on "next-renewal-at" and will not cease until the server responds with an error.
If the "deadline-at" date is reached without successfully contacting the account server, the router will consider that the license has expired and will disallow
further software updates. However, the router will continue to work with the same license tier as before.
After successful communication with the license server, the dates will be updated.
Upgrading the Level of Perpetual License
```
If you want to upgrade a perpetual license to a higher level, please transfer the previous perpetual license to another CHR first. This will prevent
the previous perpetual license from being lost during the upgrade process.
```
It is possible to upgrade the Level of Perpetual License from P1 to P10 or P-Unlimited. Once the upgrade is purchased at the full price, the former license
will become available for later use on your account.
It is also possible to upgrade the Level of Perpetual License from P10 to P-Unlimited. Once the upgrade is purchased at the full price, the former license
will become available for later use on your account.
The P-Unlimited (perpetual-unlimited) license level allows CHR to run indefinitely. It is the highest-tier license and it has no enforced limitations.
To upgrade the license level, follow these steps:
```
Go to the "All CHR keys" section on your mikrotik.com account.
Choose the CHR instance you want to upgrade and press "Upgrade".
```
```
Select the desired license level to upgrade to (P10 or P-Unlimited) and press "Upgrade".
```
```
Payment Options:
```
```
If you have prepaid keys available, you can use them for the upgrade by pressing "Pay using Prepaid key".
If you do not have prepaid keys or prefer not to use them, press "Proceed to checkout".
Choose Payment Method:
```
```
Choose your preferred payment method. You can pay using a credit card (CC) or PayPal.
```
After completing these steps, your CHR license will be upgraded to the selected level, and the previous license will be available for later use on your
account.
License Transfer
CHR installations are tied directly to the account on our website. It is possible to transfer a perpetual license to another CHR instance registered under the
same account.
First, register the new machine under the same MikroTik account where the old CHR is registered using the CLI command "/system license renew".
Once both the old and new CHR machines are visible in the "All CHR keys" section of your account, use the "Transfer" button to transfer the license.
```
Press the "Transfer" button for the System ID you need to transfer.
```
```
Select the System ID you are transferring to from the list.
```
```
Press "Transfer subscription".
```
```
Licenses cannot be transferred to another account. The license transfer process requires that both the old and new CHR instances are
registered under the same MikroTik account. If you need to use the CHR on a different account, a new license must be purchased for that
account.
```
```
It is not possible to transfer the Perpetual license to an expired instance. You will be notified: "This key is not eligible for transfer as there is no
other valid CHR key that could be upgraded to the license level of this key."
```
```
You need to create a new CHR instance, then add it to your account. Once added, you will be able to transfer the existing license to the new
CHR instance.
```
Virtual Network Adapters
RouterOS v6 does not support Fast Path.
Troubleshooting
Running on VMware ESXi
Changing MTU
VMware ESXi supports MTU of up to 9000 bytes. To get the benefit of that, you have to adjust your ESXi installation to allow a higher MTU. Virtual
Ethernet interface added after the MTU change will be properly allowed by the ESXi server to pass jumbo frames. Interfaces added prior to MTU change
on the ESXi server will be barred by the ESXi server (it will still report the old MTU as the maximum possible size). If you have this, you have to re-add
interfaces to the virtual guests.
Example. There are 2 interfaces added to the ESXi guest, auto-detected MTU on the interfaces show MTU size as it was at the time when the interface
was added:
```
[admin@chr-vm] > interface ethernet print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running, S - slave
# NAME MTU MAC-ADDRESS ARP
0 R ether1 9000 00:0C:29:35:37:5C enabled
1 R ether2 1500 00:0C:29:35:37:66 enabled
```
Using bridge on Linux
If Linux bridge supports IGMP snooping, and there are problems with IPv6 traffic it is required to disable that feature as it interacts with MLD packets
(multicast) and is not passing them through.
```
echo -n 0 > /sys/class/net/vmbr0/bridge/multicast_snooping
```
Packets not passing from guests
The problem: after configuring a software interface (VLAN, EoIP, bridge, etc.) on the guest CHR it stops passing data to the outside world beyond the
router.
The solution: check your VMS (Virtualization Management System) security settings, if other MAC addresses are allowed to pass and if packets with VLAN
tags are allowed to pass through. Adjust the security settings according to your needs like allowing MAC spoofing or a certain MAC address range. For
VLAN interfaces, it is usually possible to define allowed VLAN tags or VLAN tag range.
```
Fast Path is supported in RouterOS v7 for "vmxnet3" and "virtio-net" adapters.
```
Using VLANs on CHR in various Hypervisors
In some hypervisors, before VLAN can be used on VMs, they need to first be configured on the hypervisor itself.
ESXI
Enable Promiscuous mode in a port group or virtual switch that you will use for a specific VM.
ESX documentation:
```
https://kb.vmware.com/kb/1004099
```
Hyper-V
Hyper-V documentation:
```
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816585(v=ws.10).aspx#Anchor_2
```
bhyve hypervisor
It won't be possible to run CHR on this hypervisor. CHR cannot be run as a para-virtualized platform.
Linode
When creating multiple Linodes with the same disk size, new Linodes will have the same systemID. This will cause issues to get a Trial/Paid license. To
avoid this, run the command /system license generate-new-id after the first boot and before you request a trial or paid license. This will make
sure the ID is unique.
Some useful articles:
Specific VLAN is untagged by NIC interface:

```
Guest tools
VMWare
Time synchronization
Must be enabled from GUI ('Synchronize guest time with host'). Backward synchronization is disabled by default - if the guest is ahead of the host by more
than ~5 seconds, synchronization is not performed
Power operations
```
poweron and resume scripts are executed (if present and enabled) after power on and resume operations respectively.
poweroff and suspend scripts are executed before power off and suspend operations respectively.
If scripts take longer than 30 seconds or contain errors, the operation fails
In case of failure, retrying the same operation will ignore any errors and complete it successfully
Failed script output is saved to a file (e. g. 'poweroff-script.log', 'resume-script.log' etc)
Scripts can be enabled/disabled from hypervisor GUI ('run VMware Tools Scripts') or by enabling/disabling scripts from the console
```
Quiescing/backup
Guest filesystem quiescing is performed only if requested.
```
freeze script is executed before freezing the filesystem
freeze-fail script is executed if the hypervisor failed to prepare for a snapshot or if freeze script failed
thaw script is executed after the snapshot has been taken
Script run time is limited to 60 seconds
freeze script timeouts and errors result in the backup operation being aborted
FAT32 disks are not quiesced
Failed script output is saved to a file (e. g. 'freeze-script.log', 'freeze-fail-script.log', 'thaw-script.log')
```
Guest info
Networking, disk, and OS info are reported to the hypervisor every 30 seconds (GuestStats (memory) are disabled by default, and can be enabled by
setting 'guestinfo.disable-perfmon = "FALSE"' in VM config).
```
The order, in which network interfaces are reported, can be controlled by setting 'guestinfo.exclude-nics', 'guestinfo.primary-nics' and 'guestinfo.
low-priority-nics' options. Standard wildcard patterns can be used.
```
Provisioning
You can use the ProcessManager from Vim API to execute scripts. Python bindings are available
```
Main data structure: GuestProgramSpec
The workingDirectory and envVariables members are ignored
programPath must be set to either 'inline' or 'import'
If programPath is 'inline', arguments are interpreted as script text
If programPath is 'import', arguments are interpreted as file path
```
After using GuestProgramSpec together with an instance of GuestAuthentication as arguments to StartProgramInGuest unique JobID is obtained.
Script progress can be tracked by using the ListProcessesInGuest command. ListProcessesInGuest accepts an array of job id's; passing an empty array
will report on all jobs started from the API
```
ListProcessesInGuest returns an array of GuestProcessInfo instances:
pid field is set to JobID
endTime is only set after completion
exitCode is set to 0 on success and -1 on error
name is set to 'inline' or 'import' (same as programPath in GuestProgramSpec)
```
Information about completed jobs is kept around for ~1 minute, or until ListProcessesInGuest (with the corresponding JobID) is called. If the script fails, a
file named 'vix_job_$JobID$ .txt' containing the script output is created. Script run time is limited to 120 seconds and script output is not saved on timeout,
```
The vmrun command runScriptInGuest can also be used
The PowerCLI cmdlet Invoke-VMScript is not supported
Host/guest file transfer is not supported
```

# CHR: Hetzner Cloud Installation
Hetzner Cloud is a cloud computing platform that allows users to run virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It offers scalable infrastructure and a range of
pre-configured Linux distributions. However, for those needing advanced networking features, Hetzner Cloud is also a great platform for deploying RouterO
S CHR (Cloud Hosted Router).
CHR is a MikroTik product that provides a fully functional RouterOS installation in a virtual environment, ideal for cloud-based routing, VPN services, and
other network management tasks. By running RouterOS CHR on Hetzner Cloud, users can leverage powerful networking tools with the flexibility and
scalability of a cloud environment.
```
Create a Hetzner Cloud Server
Begin by creating a new server on Hetzner Cloud. Any of the available server options will work.
Activate Rescue System
```
```
In the Hetzner Cloud admin interface, activate the Enable Rescue system by selecting "ENABLE RESCUE & POWER CYCLE"
Choose 'linux64' as the Rescue OS.
The system will display a username and password. Use these credentials to log into the rescue system via SSH.
Install CHR (Cloud Hosted Router)
```
```
Once logged into the rescue system, download the CHR RAW disk image and write it over the system disk of the cloud server using the
following command:
curl -L https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/7.15.3/chr-7.15.3.img.zip | funzip | dd of=/dev/sda bs=1M
```
Reboot the Server
After the installation is complete, reboot the server by issuing the reboot command.
Make sure to keep your RouterOS updated and follow best security practices to maintain the safety and performance of your server.
```
Note: Replace the URL with the link to the latest CHR version available on the MikroTik download page.
```
```
It is crucial to secure your RouterOS installation immediately!
```


# CHR ProxMox installation
```
Create a new guest with the system disk and other devices as required.
```
```
Then you have to manually upload the CHR disk (in qcow format) on the ProxMox host.
```
```
Use scp or any other comparable tool as that will use SSH for the upload and it does not require any additional configuration.
```
```
Either copy the file to the server and then manually edit the VM's .conf file or replace the previously created system image file used for booting the
guest.
```
```
Local storage on ProxMox is in /var/lib/vz directory. There should be a subdirectory called images with a directory for each VM (named by the VM
number). You can copy the files directly there.
```
```
To add the existing file to the VM, edit the VM's .conf file directly. Look in /etc/pve/qemu-server/ for a file with the VM number followed by .conf.
```
Note: It's a good idea to create a second test VM so you can refer to it's.conf file to make sure you get the syntax right
Alternative approach
```
Create Basic VM via ProxMox web GUI.
Make sure that VM storage is on local storage (this way there will be no need to work with the LVM config side, and the disk image can be moved
later on to LVM or other desired storage if needed).
Log into ProxMox host via SSH and navigate to the VM image directory. Default local storage is located in: var/lib/vz/images/(VM_ID)
Via scp, wget or any other tool download CHR raw image (.img file) into this directory.
Now convert the CHR raw image to qcow2 format using qemu-img tool:
```
```
qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 chr-6.40.3.img vm-(VM_ID)-disk-1.qcow2
```
Bash script approach
If you have access to the ProxMox host then CHR VM can also be created quickly via BASH script. Below is an example of one such script.
What this script does:
```
Stores tmp files in: /root/temp dir.
Downloads raw image archive from MikroTik download page.
Converts image file to qcow format.
Creates a basic VM that is attached to the MGMT bridge.
```
```
#!/bin/bash
```
```
#vars
version="nil"
vmID="nil"
```
```
echo "############## Start of Script ##############
```
```
## Checking if temp dir is available..."
if [ -d /root/temp ]
then
echo "-- Directory exists!"
else
echo "-- Creating temp dir!"
mkdir /root/temp
fi
# Ask user for version
echo "## Preparing for image download and VM creation!"
read -p "Please input CHR version to deploy (6.38.2, 6.40.1, etc):" version
# Check if image is available and download if needed
if [ -f /root/temp/chr-$version.img ]
then
echo "-- CHR image is available."
else
echo "-- Downloading CHR $version image file."
cd /root/temp
echo "---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
wget https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/$version/chr-$version.img.zip
unzip chr-$version.img.zip
echo "---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
fi
# List already existing VM's and ask for vmID
echo "== Printing list of VM's on this hypervisor!"
qm list
echo ""
read -p "Please Enter free vm ID to use:" vmID
echo ""
# Create storage dir for VM if needed.
if [ -d /var/lib/vz/images/$vmID ]
then
echo "-- VM Directory exists! Ideally try another vm ID!"
read -p "Please Enter free vm ID to use:" vmID
else
echo "-- Creating VM image dir!"
mkdir /var/lib/vz/images/$vmID
fi
# Creating qcow2 image for CHR.
echo "-- Converting image to qcow2 format "
qemu-img convert \
-f raw \
-O qcow2 \
/root/temp/chr-$version.img \
/var/lib/vz/images/$vmID/vm-$vmID-disk-1.qcow2
# Creating VM
echo "-- Creating new CHR VM"
qm create $vmID \
--name chr-$version \
--net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 \
--bootdisk virtio0 \
--ostype l26 \
--memory 256 \
--onboot no \
--sockets 1 \
--cores 1 \
--virtio0 local:$vmID/vm-$vmID-disk-1.qcow2
echo "############## End of Script ##############"
```
Useful tips
```

# CHR Vultr installation
Vultr has more than two dozen data center locations where you can choose to deploy MikroTik CHR for the best throughput and latency.
Follow these steps to install MikroTik CHR at Vultr.

## Step 1: Deploy a server in rescue mode
In this step, you'll deploy a new server at Vultr with SystemRescue, a bootable Linux ISO.
```
Deploy a new Cloud Compute instance.
Choose the location with the best performance for your needs. You can use Vultr's network-looking glass to test the throughput and latency of any
location.
Select the ISO Library tab in the Server Image section.
Choose SystemRescue x64.
Choose a server size with enough bandwidth allowance for your requirements.
Give the server a hostname, and a label, and then click Deploy Now.
```
When the server finishes deploying, proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Write the CHR image to the disk
```
In your web browser, navigate to the MikroTik download page.
Locate the latest Stable RAW CHR disk image. Vultr requires version 7.2.3 Stable or later.
Right-click the floppy disk icon to copy the URL. Don't download the image now, you'll download it to the server in a later step.
```
```
Navigate to the server's information page in the Vultr customer portal.
Connect to the web console.
```
```
In the web console, download the CHR image to the server with "wget". If you copied the download URL to your clipboard, you can send it to the
server through the web console.
```
```
Substitute your version for x.x.x in the examples that follow.
```
```
# wget https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/x.x.x/chr-x.x.x.img.zip
```
```
Unzip the downloaded file.

```
```
$ ssh admin@192.0.2.2
```
```
Enter the strong password you set in the prior step.
```
This completes the basic installation. Please secure your MikroTik CHR router and consult the documentation to configure the server for production use.
Visit Vultr site for configuration manual and for their firewall features.


# Upgrading to v7

## Introduction
This document describes the recommended steps for upgrading RouterOS to v7 major release and the possible caveats when doing so.
Upgrading from v6 to v7 happens the same way, as upgrading within v6 releases. Please follow the Upgrade manual for more detailed steps. If you are
currently running RouterOS version 6 or older, we first suggest upgrading to the latest stable or long-term release in v6.

## Feature list compatibility
As previously stated, nearly all RouterOS systems can use the "Check for updates" functionality and upgrade to v7 in a few clicks, but there are some
features, where extra steps may be required:
```
Feature Status
```
```
CAPsMAN OK
```
```
Interfaces OK
```
```
Wireless OK
```
```
Bridge/Switching OK
```
```
Tunnels/PPP OK
```
```
IPv6 OK
```
```
BGP OK, but attention is required  *
```
```
OSPF OK, but attention is required **
```
```
MPLS OK, but attention is required ***
```
```
Routing filters OK, but attention is required ****
```
```
PIM-SM See notes
```
```
IGMP Proxy OK
```
```
Tools OK
```
```
Queues OK
```
```
Firewall OK
```
```
HotSpot OK
```
```
Static Routing OK
```
```
User Manager See notes
```
```
Note that in your RouterOS v6.x, only RouterOS release 7.12.1 will be shown as the latest release. You must upgrade to this version first and
only then further upgrades to newer versions will become available.
```
```
In most RouterOS setups that run fine with the aforementioned v6 versions, no extra steps are required. Upgrading to v7 will automatically
convert the configuration and your device will function right away.
```
```
Note: We do not recommend running v7 on hardware that does not have at least 64 MB of RAM.
```
Notes
BGP
All known configurations will upgrade from 6.x to 7.x successfully. But keep in mind that there is a complete redesign of the configuration. v7 BGP
implementation provides with connection, template and session menus.
Template contains all BGP protocol-related configuration options. It can be used as a template for dynamic peers and apply a similar config to a group of
peers. Most of the parameters are similar to the previous implementation except that some are grouped in the output and input section making the config
more readable and easier to understand whether the option is applied on input or output.
BGP connection minimal set of parameters are remote.address, template, connect, listen and local.role
Connect and listen to parameters specify whether peers will try to connect and listen to a remote address or just connect or just listen. It is possible that in
setups where peer uses the multi-hop connection local.address must be configured too. Peer role is now a mandatory parameter, for basic setups, you
can just use ibgp, ebgp.
Now you can monitor the status of all connected and disconnected peers from /routing bgp session menu.
Other great debugging information on all routing processes can be monitored from /routing stats menu.
Networks are added to the firewall address-list and referenced in the BGP connection configuration.

### OSPF
All known configurations will upgrade from 6.x to 7.x successfully.
OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 are now merged into one single menu /routing ospf. At the moment there are no default instances and areas. To start OSPF
you need to create an instance and then add area to the instance.
RouterOSv7 uses templates to match the interface against the template and apply configuration from the matched template. OSPF menus interface
and neighbor contains read-only entries for status monitoring.

### MPLS
Upgrade MPLS setups with caution, and make sure to backup configuration before the upgrade.
Routing filters
All supported options are upgraded without any issue, in the case of an unsupported option - an empty entry is created. The routing filter configuration is
changed to a script-like configuration.
The rule now can have "if .. then" syntax to set parameters or apply actions based on conditions from the "if" statement.
Multiple rules without action are stacked in a single rule and executed in order like a firewall, the reason is that the "set" parameter order is important, and
writing one "set"s per line, allows for an easier understanding from top to bottom on what actions were applied.
More RouterOSv7 routing filter examples are here.

### PIM-SM
Upgrading RouterOS to v7 will not preserve PIM-related configuration. After the upgrade, multicast routing configuration will be available under the /routi
ng/pimsm menu and an additional "multicast" package is not required anymore. More information is available here.
```
The routing protocol configuration upgrade is triggered only once. This means that if a router was downgraded to ROSv6, the configuration was
modified and the router got upgraded back to ROSv7, then the resulting configuration is the one that was present before the downgrade. To re-
trigger v6 configuration conversion, load ROSv6 backup with the option force-v6-to-v7-configuration-upgrade=yes.
```
User Manager
RouterOSv7 provides the new and redesigned implementation of User Manager, configuration is now integrated into RouterOS WinBox and console (WEB
admin configuration interface is not available), more information is available here. Direct migration from older User Manager is not possible, it is possible to
migrate older database from /user-manager/database/migrate-legacy-db However, it might be a good idea to start configuration from the scratch.
New features
A New Kernel is implemented in RouterOSv7, which leads to performance changes due to route cache, as well some tasks might require higher CPU and
RAM usage for different processes.
```
completely new NTP client and server implementation
merged individual packages, only bundle and a few extra packages remain (dropped support for LCD and KVM packages)
new Command Line Interface (CLI) style (RouterOS v6 commands are still supported)
support for Let's Encrypt certificate generation
support for REST API
support for UEFI boot mode on x86
CHR FastPath support for "vmxnet3" and "virtio-net" drivers
support for "Cake" and "FQ_Codel" type queues
support for IPv6 NAT
support for Layer 3 hardware acceleration on all CRS3xx devices
support for MBIM driver with basic functionality support for all modems with MBIM mode
support for MLAG on CRS3xx devices
support for VRRP grouping and connection tracking data synchronization between nodes
support for Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)
support for L2TPv3
support for OpenVPN UDP transport protocol
support for WireGuard
support for hardware offloaded VLAN filtering on RTL8367 (RB4011, RB100AHx4) and MT7621 (hEX, hEX S, RBM33G) switches
support for ZeroTier on ARM and ARM64 devices
completely new alternative wireless package "wifiwave2" with 802.11ac Wave2, WPA3, and 802.11w management frame protection support
(requires ARM CPU and 256MB RAM)
support for hardware offloaded VLAN filtering on RTL8367 (RB4011, RB100AHx4) and MT7621 (hEX, hEX S, RBM33G) switches
support CPU frequency scaling for x86 devices
```
Dropped support
In RouterOS v7 has been dropped support for:
```
LCD package
KVM package
```


# RouterBOOT
```
Main and Backup loaders
RouterBOARD reset button
Configuration Reset For Wireless Wire kits
Configuration
Simple Upgrade
Checking RouterBOOT version
```
RouterBOOT is responsible for starting RouterOS in RouterBOARD devices.

## Main and Backup loaders
By default, the main (regular) loader is used, but RouterBOARD devices also have a secondary (backup) bootloader, which can be used in case the main
doesn't work. It is possible to call the backup loader with a configuration setting in RouterOS:
```
system/routerboard/settings/set force-backup-booter=yes
```
It is also possible to use the backup booter by turning on the device, with the RESET button pushed. It is only possible to upgrade the main RouterBOOT,
so in case of failure, you can use the backup booter to start the device and downgrade the main loader. For upgrade instructions, follow the separate
instructions in RouterBOARD#UpgradingRouterBOOT

## RouterBOARD reset button
RouterBOOT reset button has three functions:
```
Hold this button during boot time until the LED light starts flashing, and release the button to reset the RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds)
Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAPs mode (total 10 seconds)
Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until the LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers
```
Reset the password
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Unz92rABs8

## Configuration Reset For Wireless Wire kits
The reset button has the same functionality as on other devices, explained in detail https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Reset+Button
5-second button hold on startup (USR LED light starts flashing) - resets to password-protected state.
10-second button hold on startup (USR LED turns solid after flashing) - completely removes configuration.

## Configuration
For RouterBOARD devices that feature a serial console connector, it is possible to access the RouterBOOT loader configuration menu. The required cable
is described in the Serial Console manual. RouterBOARD serial port is configured to 115200bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. We suggest
disabling the hardware flow control.
This example shows the menu which is available in RouterBOOT 7.4beta4:
```
If you hold the button before applying power, backup RouterBOOT will be used in addition to all the above actions. To do the above actions
without loading the backup loader, push the button right after applying power to the device.

Simple Upgrade
RouterBOOT can be upgraded from RouterOS by:
```
Run command /system routerboard upgrade
Reboot your router to apply the upgrade (/system reboot)]
```
```
[admin@admin] > system/routerboard/upgrade
Do you really want to upgrade firmware? [y/n]
```
```
Every ROS version has a new RouterBoot version included in it, once you perform a ROS upgrade we always recommend upgrading
RouterBoot also.
```
Checking RouterBOOT version
This command shows the current RouterBOOT version of your device and the available upgrade which is included in routeros-x.yy.npk package, or if you
uploaded a *.FWF file corresponding to the device model:
```
[admin@admin] > system/routerboard/print
;;; Firmware upgraded successfully, please reboot for changes
to take effect!
routerboard: yes
board-name: hAP ac
model: RouterBOARD 962UiGS-5HacT2HnT
serial-number: 6737057562DD
firmware-type: qca9550L
factory-firmware: 3.29
current-firmware: 6.49.5
upgrade-firmware: 7.4beta5
```
In this case, you see, there is a newer version of the Bootloader firmware available already inside your current RouterOS version and it has been updated
and requires a reboot.
```
A downgrade is also possible by uploading *.FWF file with an older version may be required for troubleshooting purposes when contacting
MikroTik support.

## Networking Models
```
Computer networks consist of many different components and protocols working together. To understand the concept of how node to node
communication happens, let's get familiar to the OSI model and TCP/IP model. Both models help to visualize how communication between nodes is
happening.
```

## OSI Model
```
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a 7-layer model that today is used as a teaching tool. The OSI model was originally conceived as a
standard architecture for building network systems, but in real-world networks are much less defined than the OSI model suggests.
```
```
Layer 7 (Application) - a protocol that defines the communication between the server and the client, for example, HTTP protocol. If the web
browser wants to download an image, the protocol will organize and execute the request;
Layer 6 (Presentation) - ensures data is received in a usable format. Encryption is done here (but in reality it may not be true, for example,
IPSec);
Layer 5 (Session) - responsible for setting up, managing and closing sessions between client and server;
Layer 4 (Transport) - transport layers primary responsibility is assembly and reassembly, a data stream is divided into chunks (segments),
assigned sequence numbers and encapsulated into protocol header (TCP, UDP, etc.);
Layer 3 (Network) - responsible for logical device addressing, data is encapsulated within an IP header and now called "packet";
Layer 2 (Data link) - Data is encapsulated within a custom header, either 802.3 (Ethernet) or 802.11 (wireless) and is called "frame", handles
flow control;
Layer 1 (Physical) - Communication media that sends and receives bits, electric signaling, and hardware interface;
```

## TCP/IP Model
```
This model has the same purpose as the OSI model but fits better into modern network troubleshooting. Comparing to the OSI model, TCP/IP is a 4-
layer model:
```
```
Application layer (4) - includes application, presentation and session layers of the OSI model, which significantly simplifies network
troubleshooting;
Transport layer (3) - same as a transport layer in the OSI model (TCP, UDP protocols);
Internet layer (2) - does the same as Network layer in the OSI model (include ARP, IP protocols);
Link layer (1) - also called the Network Access layer. Includes both Layer1 and 2 of the OSI model, therefore its primary concern is physical
data exchange between network nodes;
```
```
TCP/IP OSI Model Protocols
```
```
Application Layer Application Layer DNS, DHCP,HTTP,SSH etc.
```
```
Presentation Layer JPEG,MPEG,PICT etc.
```
```
Session Layer PAP, SCP, ZIP etc.
```
```
Transport Layer Transport Layer TCP, UDP
```
```
Internet Layer Network Layer ICMP, IGMP, IPv4, IPv6, IPSec
```
```
Link Layer Data Link Layer ARP, CDP, MPLS, PPP etc.
```
```
Physical Layer Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi etc.
```
Ethernet
The most commonly used link layer protocol (OSI Layer2) in computer networks is the Ethernet protocol. In order to communicate, each node has a
unique assigned address, called MAC (Media Access Control address) sometimes it is also called an Ethernet address.
It is 48-bit long and typically fixed by the manufacturer (cannot be changed), but in recent years customization of MAC addresses is widely used,
RouterOS also allows to set custom MAC address.
Most commonly used MAC format is 6 hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (D4:CA:6D:01:22:96)
RouterOS shows MAC address in a configuration for all Ethernet-like interfaces (Wireless, 60G, VPLS, etc.)
```

9 sfp-sfpplus2 1500 D4:CA:6D:01:22:95 enabled
```
There are three types of addresses:
```
Unicast address is sent to all nodes within the collision domain, which typically is Ethernet cable between two nodes or in case of wireless all
receivers that can detect wireless signals. Only remote node with matching MAC address will accept the frame (unless the promiscuous
mode is enabled)
One of the special addresses is broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), a broadcast frame is accepted and forwarded over Layer2
network by all nodes
Another special address is multicast. Frames with multicast addresses are received by all nodes configured to receive frames with this
address.
```
IP Networking
Ethernet protocol is sufficient to get data between two nodes on an Ethernet network, but it is not used on its own. For Internet/Networking layer (OSI
Layer 3) IP (Internet Protocol) is used to identify hosts with unique logical addresses.
Most of the current networks use IPv4 addresses, which are 32bit address written in dotted-decimal notation (192.168.88.1)
There can be multiple logical networks and to identify which network IP address belongs to, the netmask is used. Netmask typically is specified as a
number of bits used to identify a logical network. The format can also be in decimal notation, for example, the 24-bit netmask can be written as 255.25
5.255.0
Let's take a closer look at 192.168.3.24/24:

### 11000000 10101000 00000011 00011000 => 192.168.3.24
```
11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000 => /24 or 255.255.255.0
```
As can be seen from the illustration above high 24 bits are masked, leaving us with a range of 0-255.
From this range, the first address is used to identify the network (in our example network address would be 192.168.3.0) and the last one is used for
network broadcast (192.168.3.255). That leaves us with a range from 1 to 254 for host identification which is called unicast addresses.
The same as in Ethernet protocol there can be also special addresses:
```
broadcast - address to send data to all possible destinations ("all-hosts broadcast"), which permits the sender to send the data only once, and
all receivers receive a copy of it. In the IPv4 protocol, the address 255.255.255.255 is used for local broadcast. In addition, a directed (limited)
broadcast can be made to network broadcast address;
multicast - address associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 are
designated as multicast addresses. The sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the
intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group;
```
In case of logical IP network, unicast, broadcast and multicast visualization would look a bit different
There are also address ranges reserved for a special purpose, for example, private address range, that should be used only in local networks and
typically are dropped when forwarded to the internet:
```
10.0.0.0/8 - start: 10.0.0.0; end: 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12 - start: 172.16.0.0; end:172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16 - start: 192.168.0.0; end: 192.168.255.255
```
ARP and Tying It All Together
Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses, hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another.
This brings us to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used for mapping the IP address of the host to the hardware address (MAC). ARP
protocol is referenced in RFC 826.
Each network device has a table of currently used ARP entries. Normally the table is built dynamically, but to increase network security, it can be
partially or completely built statically by means of adding static entries.
When a host on the local area network wants to send an IP packet to another host in this network, it must look for the Ethernet MAC address of
destination host in its ARP cache. If the destination host’s MAC address is not in the ARP table, then the ARP request is sent to find the device with a
corresponding IP address. ARP sends a broadcast request message to all devices on the LAN by asking the devices with the specified IP address to
reply with its MAC address. A device that recognizes the IP address as its own returns ARP response with its own MAC address:
```
Address Resolution Protocol is a thing of the past. IPv6 completely eliminates use of the ARP.
```
Let's make a simple configuration and take a closer look at processes when Host A tries to ping Host C.
At first, we add IP addresses on Host A:
```
/ip address add address=10.155.101.225 interface=ether1
```
Host B:
```
/ip address add address=10.155.101.221 interface=ether1
```
Host C:
```
/ip address add address=10.155.101.217 interface=ether1
```
Now, let's run a packet sniffer that saves packet dump to the file and run the ping command on Host A:
```
/tool sniffer
set file-name=arp.pcap filter-interface=ether1
start
/ping 10.155.101.217 count=1
stop
```
Now you can download arp.pcap file from the router and open it in Wireshark for analyzing:
```
Host A sends ARP message asking who has "10.155.101.217"
Host C responds that 10.155.101.217 can be reached at 08:00:27:3C:79:3A MAC address
Both Host A and Host C now have updated their ARP tables and now ICMP (ping) packets can be sent
```
If we look at ARP tables of both host we can see relevant entries, in RouterOS ARP table can be viewed by running command: /ip arp print
```
[admin@host_a] /ip arp> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, H - DHCP, D - dynamic, P - published,
C - complete
# ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS INTERFACE
0 DC 10.155.101.217 08:00:27:3C:79:3A ether1
```
```
[admin@host_b] /ip arp> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, H - DHCP, D - dynamic, P - published,
C - complete
# ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS INTERFACE
0 DC 10.155.101.225 08:00:27:85:69:B5 ether1
```
ARP Modes
Now the example above demonstrated default behavior, where ARP is enabled on interfaces, but there might be scenarios where different ARP
behavior is necessary. RouterOS allows configuring different ARP modes for interfaces that support ARP.
Enabled
ARPs will be discovered automatically and new dynamic entries will be added to the ARP table. This is a default mode for interfaces in RouterOS and
illustrated in the example above.
Disabled
If the ARP feature is turned off on the interface, i.e., arp=disabled is used, ARP requests from clients are not answered by the router. Therefore, static
ARP entry should be added to the clients as well. For example, the router's IP and MAC addresses should be added:
```
[admin@host_a] > /ip arp add mac-address=08:00:27:3C:79:3A address=10.155.101.217 interface=ether1
```
Reply Only
If the ARP property is set to reply-only on the interface, then the router only replies to ARP requests. Neighbour MAC addresses will be resolved using
/ip arp statically, but there will be no need to add the router's MAC address to other hosts' ARP tables like in cases where ARP is disabled.
Proxy ARP
A router with properly configured proxy ARP feature acts as a transparent ARP proxy between directly connected networks. This behavior can be
useful, for example, if you want to assign dial-in (PPP, PPPoE, PPTP) clients IP addresses from the same address space as used on the connected
LAN.
Let's look at the example setup from the image above. Host A (172.16.1.2) on Subnet A wants to send packets to Host D (172.16.2.3) on Subnet B.
Host A has a /16 subnet mask which means that Host A believes that it is directly connected to all 172.16.0.0/16 network (the same LAN). Since the
Host A believes that is directly connected it sends an ARP request to the destination to clarify the MAC address of Host D. (in the case when Host A
finds that destination IP address is not from the same subnet it sends a packet to the default gateway.). Host A broadcasts an ARP request on Subnet
A.

Sender IP address: 173.16.1.2
Target MAC address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
Target IP address: 173.16.2.3
```
With this ARP request, Host A (172.16.1.2) is asking Host D (172.16.2.3) to send its MAC address. The ARP request packet is then encapsulated in
an Ethernet frame with the MAC address of Host A as the source address and a broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) as the destination address. Layer 2
broadcast means that frame will be sent to all hosts in the same layer 2 broadcast domain which includes the ether0 interface of the router, but does
not reach Host D, because router by default does not forward layer 2 broadcasts.
Since the router knows that the target address (172.16.2.3) is on another subnet but it can reach Host D, it replies with its own MAC address to Host A.

Target IP address: 172.16.1.2
```
This is the Proxy ARP reply that the router sends to Host A. Router sends back unicast proxy ARP reply with its own MAC address as the source
address and the MAC address of Host A as the destination address, by saying "send these packets to me, and I'll get it to where it needs to go."
When Host A receives ARP response it updates its ARP table, as shown:
```
C:\Users\And>arp -a
Interface: 173.16.2.1 --- 0x8
Internet Address Physical Address Type
173.16.1.254 00-0c-42-52-2e-cf dynamic
173.16.2.3 00-0c-42-52-2e-cf dynamic
173.16.2.2 00-0c-42-52-2e-cf dynamic
```
After MAC table update, Host A forwards all the packets intended for Host D (172.16.2.3) directly to router interface ether0 (00:0c:42:52:2e:cf) and the
router forwards packets to Host D. The ARP cache on the hosts in Subnet A is populated with the MAC address of the router for all the hosts on
Subnet B. Hence, all packets destined to Subnet B are sent to the router. The router forwards those packets to the hosts in Subnet B.
Multiple IP addresses by the host are mapped to a single MAC address (the MAC address of this router) when proxy ARP is used.
Proxy ARP can be enabled on each interface individually with command arp=proxy-arp:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface ethernet> set 1 arp=proxy-arp
[admin@MikroTik] /interface ethernet> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
# NAME MTU MAC-ADDRESS ARP

```
Local Proxy ARP

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.

### 1.
if the arp property is set to local-proxy-arp on an interface, then the router performs proxy ARP to/from this interface only. I.e. for traffic that comes in
and goes out of the same interface. In a normal LAN, the default behavior is for two network hosts to communicate directly with each other, without
involving the router.
This is done to support (Ethernet) switch features, like RFC 3069, where the individual ports are NOT allowed to communicate with each other, but
they are allowed to talk to the upstream router. As described in RFC 3069, it is possible to allow these hosts to communicate through the upstream
router by proxy_arp'ing. Don't need to be used together with proxy_arp. This technology is known by different names:
```
In RFC 3069 it is called VLAN Aggregation;
Cisco and Allied Telesis call it Private VLAN;
Hewlett-Packard calls it Source-Port filtering or port-isolation;
Ericsson calls it MAC-Forced Forwarding (RFC Draft).
```
TCP/IP
TCP Session Establishment and Termination
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. The difference between a connection-oriented protocol and a connection-less protocol is that a connection-
oriented protocol does not send any data until a proper connection is established.
TCP uses a three-way handshake whenever the transmitting device tries to establish a connection to the remote node. As a result end-to-end virtual
(logical) circuit is created where flow control and acknowledgment for reliable delivery are used. TCP has several message types used in connection
establishment and termination process.
Connection establishment process
```
The host A who needs to initialize a connection sends out an SYN (Synchronize) packet with a proposed initial sequence number to the
destination "host B";
When the host B receives an SYN message, it returns a packet with both SYN and ACK flags set in the TCP header (SYN-ACK);
When the host A receives the SYN-ACK, it sends back the ACK (Acknowledgment) packet;
Host B receives ACK and at this stage, the connection is ESTABLISHED;
```
Connection-oriented protocol services are often sending acknowledgments (ACKs) after successful delivery. After the packet with data is transmitted,
the sender waits for acknowledgment from the receiver. If time expires and the sender did not receive ACK, a packet is retransmitted.
Connection termination
When the data transmission is complete and the host wants to terminate the connection, the termination process is initiated. Unlike TCP Connection
establishment, which uses a three-way handshake, connection termination uses four-way massages. A connection is terminated when both sides
have finished the shutdown procedure by sending a FIN (finish) and receiving an ACK (Acknowledgment).

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.
```
The host A, who needs to terminate the connection, sends a special message with the FIN flag, indicating that it has finished sending the
data;
The host B, who receives the FIN segment, does not terminate the connection but enters into a "passive close" (CLOSE_WAIT) state and
sends the ACK for the FIN back to the host A. If host B does not have any data to transmit to the host A it will also send the FIN message.
Now the host B enters into LAST_ACK state. At this point host B will no longer accept data from host A, but can continue to transmit data to
host A.
When the host A receives the last FIN from the host B, it enters into a (TIME_WAIT) state, and sends an ACK back to the host B;
Host B gets the ACK from the host A and connection is terminated;
```
TCP Segments transmission (windowing)
Now that we know how the TCP connection is established we need to understand how data transmission is managed and maintained. In TCP/IP
networks transmission between hosts is handled by TCP protocol.
Let’s think about what happens when data-grams are sent out faster than the receiving device can process. The receiver stores them in memory
called a buffer. But since buffer space is not unlimited, when its capacity is exceeded receiver starts to drop the frames. All dropped frames must be re-
transmitted again which is the reason for low transmission performance.
To address this problem, TCP uses a flow control protocol. The window mechanism is used to control the flow of the data. When a connection is
established, the receiver specifies the window field in each TCP frame. Window size represents the amount of received data that the receiver is willing
to store in the buffer. Window size (in bytes) is sent together with acknowledgments to the sender. So the size of the window controls how much
information can be transmitted from one host to another without receiving an acknowledgment. The sender will send only the amount of bytes
specified in window size and then will wait for acknowledgments with updated window size.
If the receiving application can process data as quickly as it arrives from the sender, then the receiver will send a positive window advertisement
(increase the size of the window) with each acknowledgment. It works until the sender becomes faster than the receiver and incoming data will
eventually fill the receiver's buffer, causing the receiver to advertise acknowledgment with a zero window. A sender that receives a zero window
advertisement must stop transmit until it receives a positive window.  Let's take a look at the illustrated windowing process:
```
The "host A" starts to transmit with a window size of 1000, one 1000byte frame is transmitted;
Receiver "host B" returns ACK with window size to increase to 2000;
```

### 3.

### 4.

### 5.

### 6.
```
The host A receives ACK and transmits two frames (1000 bytes each);
After that, the receiver advertises an initial window size to 3000. Now sender transmits three frames and waits for an acknowledgement;
The first three segments fill the receiver's buffer faster than the receiving application can process the data, so the advertised window size
reaches zero indicating that it is necessary to wait before further transmission is possible;
The size of the window and how fast to increase or decrease the window size is available in various TCP congestion avoidance algorithms
such as Reno, Vegas, Tahoe, etc;

## Overview
IP addresses serve for general host identification purposes in IP networks (RFC 791). A typical (IPv4) address consists of four octets. For proper
addressing the router also needs the network mask value, id est which bits of the complete IP address refer to the address of the host, and which - to the
address of the network. The network address value is calculated by binary AND operation from a network mask and IP address values. It's also possible to
specify an IP address followed by a slash "/" and the number of bits that form the network address.
In most cases, it is enough to specify the address, the netmask, and the interface arguments. The network prefix and the broadcast address are calculated
automatically.
It is possible to add multiple IP addresses to an interface or to leave the interface without any addresses assigned to it. In the case of bridging or PPPoE
connection, the physical interface may not have any address assigned, yet be perfectly usable. Configuring an IP address to a physical interface included
in a bridge would mean actually setting it on the bridge interface itself.
You can use /ip address print detail to see which interface the address belongs to.

## IPv4 Addressing
IPv4 uses 4-byte addresses which are segmented in four 8-bit fields called octets. Each octet is converted to a decimal format and separated by a dot. For
example:

### 11000000 10101000 00000011 00011000 => 192.168.3.24
The IPv4 network consists of three addresses:
```
network address - a standard way to refer to an IPv4 address assigned to a network. For example, we could refer to the network 192.168.1.0 or
172.16.0.0 as a “Network Address.”
broadcast address - a special address for each network that allows communication to all the hosts in that network. The broadcast address uses
the highest address in the network range. for example, broadcast address if 192.168.1.0/24 network will be 192.168.1.255
host address - any other address that is not a network address and broadcast address can be used as a host address. For example, 192.168.1.2
```
- 254 host addresses can be used from 192.168.1.0/24 address range
There are several types of IP addressing
```
unicast - normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is
associated with a single device or host, but it is not a one-to-one correspondence.
```
```
broadcast - address to send data to all possible destinations ("all-hosts broadcast"), which permits the sender to send the data only once, and all
receivers receive a copy of it. In the IPv4 protocol, the address 255.255.255.255 is used for local broadcast. In addition, a directed (limited)
broadcast can be made by combining the network prefix with a host suffix composed entirely of binary 1s. For example, the destination address
used for directed broadcast to devices on the 192.0.2.0/24 network is 192.0.2.255
multicast - address associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 are designated as
multicast addresses. The sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers
take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group.
```
Private Address Range
The following IP address ranges are reserved (RFC 6890) for private addressing. These addresses are not routed in the global routing table and should be
translated to global addresses with network address translation (NAT):
```
10.0.0.0/8 - start: 10.0.0.0; end: 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12 - start: 172.16.0.0; end:172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16 - start: 192.168.0.0; end: 192.168.255.255
```
Other Reserved Address Ranges
```
198.18.0.0/15 - benchmarking
192.88.99.0/24 - 6to4 relay anycast address range
192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24 - documentation
169.254.0.0/16 - auto-configuration address range
```
Adding IP Address
Consider a setup where two routers are directly connected with the cable and we do not want to waste address space:
R1 configuration:
```
/ip address
add address=10.1.1.1/32 interface=ether1 network=172.16.1.1
```
R2 configuration:
```
/ip address
add address=172.16.1.1/32 interface=ether1 network=10.1.1.1
```
IPv6 Addressing
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the newer version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It was initially expected to replace IPv4 in a short enough time, but for
now, it seems that these two versions will coexist on the Internet in foreseeable future. Nevertheless, IPv6 becomes more important, as the date of the
unallocated IPv4 address pool's exhaustion approaches.
The two main benefits of IPv6 over IPv4 are:
```
much larger address space;
support of stateless and stateful address auto-configuration;
built-in security;
new header format (faster forwarding).
```
IPv6 uses 16 bytes addresses compared to 4-byte addresses in IPv4. IPv6 address syntax and types are described in RFC 4291.
There are multiple IPv6 address types, that can be recognized by their prefix. RouterOS distinguishes the following:
```
multicast (with prefix ff00::/8)
link-local (with prefix fe80::/10)
unique local addresses (with prefix fc00::/7)
loopback (the address::1/128)
unspecified (the address::/128)
```
```
other (all other addresses, including the obsoleted site-local addresses, and RFC 4193 unique local addresses; they all are treated as global
unicast).
```
One difference between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses is that IPv6 automatically generates a link-local IPv6 address for each active interface that has IPv6
support.
IPv6 addresses are represented a little bit differently than IPv4 addresses. For IPv6, the 128-bit address is divided into eight 16-bit blocks, and each 16-bit
block is converted to a 4-digit hexadecimal number and separated by colons. The resulting representation is called colon-hexadecimal.
In the example below IPv6 address in binary format is converted to a colon-hexadecimal representation

### 0010000000000001 0000010001110000 0001111100001001 0000000100110001

### 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000001001
```
2001:0470:1f09:0131:0000:0000:0000:0009
```
The IPv6 address can be further simplified by removing leading zeros in each block:
```
2001:470:1f09:131:0:0:0:9
```
As you can see IPv6 addresses can have long sequences of zeros. This contiguous sequence can be compressed to ::
```
2001:470:1f09:131::9
```
IPv6 prefix is written in address/prefix-length format. Compared to IPv4 decimal representation of a network mask cannot be used. Prefix examples:
```
2001:470:1f09:131::/64
2001:db8:1234::/48
2607:f580::/32
2000::/3
```
Address Types
Several IPv6 address types exist:
```
Unicast
Anycast
Multicast
```
As you can see there are no Broadcast addresses in the IPv6 network, compared to the IPv4 broadcast functionality was completely replaced with
multicast.
Unicast Addresses
Packets addressed to a unicast address are delivered only to a single interface. To this group belong:
```
globally unique addresses and can be used to connect to addresses with global scope anywhere;
link-local addresses;
unique local addresses (ULA RFC4193)
site-local addresses (FEC0::/48) - deprecated;
special-purpose addresses;
compatibility addresses;
```
```
Zero compression can only be used once. Otherwise, you could not determine the number of 0 bits represented by each instance of a double-
colon
```
A global unicast address can be automatically assigned to the node by Stateless Address auto-configuration.
Link-local Address
A link-local address is required on every IPv6-enabled interface, applications may rely on the existence of a link-local address even when there is no IPv6
routing, that is why the link-local address is generated automatically for every active interface using its interface identifier (calculated EUI-64 from MAC
address if present). The address prefix is always FE80::/64 and IPv6 router never forwards link-local traffic beyond the link.
These addresses are comparable to the auto-configuration addresses 169.254.0.0/16 of IPv4.
A link-local address is also required for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery processes.
Unique Local Address
Unique Local Address (ULA) is reserved for local use in the home and enterprise environments not routed in public address space and is equivalent to
IPv4 private address ranges.
The reserved address range is fc00::/7
Special Purpose Address
```
Address Description
```
```
Unspecified address (::
/128)
```
```
Never assigned to an interface or used as a destination address, used only to indicate the absence of an address. Equivalent
to IPv4 0.0.0.0 address.
```
```
loopback address (::1
/128)
```
```
Used to identify a loopback interface, enabling a node to send packets to itself. It is equivalent to the IPv4 loopback address of
127.0.0.1.
```
```
2002::/16 This prefix is used for 6to4 addressing. Here, an address from the IPv4 network 192.88.99.0/24 is also used.
```
```
2001:db8::/32 Address range reserved for documentation. These should never be seen as the source or destination.
```
```
2001:0010::/28 Orchid fixed term experiment. Should not be seen as a source or destination
```
```
2001:0002::/48 Used for benchmarking, should not be seen as source or destination
```
```
2001:0000::/32 Teredo
```
Compatibility Address
```
Address Description
```
```
IPv4
compatibl
e address
```
```
used by dual-stack nodes that are communicating with IPv6 over an IPv4 infrastructure. When the IPv4-compatible address is used as an
IPv6 destination, IPv6 traffic is automatically encapsulated with an IPv4 header and sent to the destination by using the IPv4 infrastructure.
The address is written in the following format ::w.x.y.z, where w.x.y.z is the dotted decimal representation of a public IPv4 address.
```
```
IPv4
mapped
address
```
```
used to represent an IPv4-only node to an IPv6 node. It is used only for internal representation. The IPv4-mapped address is never used as
a source or destination address for an IPv6 packet. The IPv6 protocol does not support the use of IPv4-mapped addresses. The address is
written in the following format: ::ffff:w.x.y.z, where w.x.y.z is the dotted-decimal representation of a public IPv4 address.
```
Multicast Address
The most important multicast aspects are:
```
traffic is sent to a single address but is processed by multiple hosts;
group membership is dynamic, allowing hosts to join and leave the group at any time;
in IPv6, Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) messages are used to determine group membership on a network segment, also known as a link or
subnet;
a host can send traffic to the group's address without belonging to the corresponding group.
```
```
If the interface is set as a bridge port, an interface-specific link-local address is removed leaving only the bridge link-local address
```
A single IPv6 multicast address identifies each multicast group. Each group's reserved IPv6 address is shared by all host members of the group who listen
and receive any IPv6 messages sent to the group's address.
The multicast address consists of the following parts:
```
The first 8 bits in the multicast address are always 1111 1111 (which is FF in hexadecimal format).
The flag uses the 9th to 12th bit and shows if this multicast address is predefined (well-known) or not. If it is well-known, all bits are 0s.
Scope ID indicates to which scope multicast address belongs, for example, Scope ID=2 is link-local scope.
The group ID is used to specify a multicast group. There are predefined group IDs, such as Group ID=1 - all nodes. Therefore, if the multicast
address is ff02::1, that means Scope ID=2 and Group ID=1, indicating all nodes in link-local scope. This is analogous to broadcast on IPv4.
```
Here is the table of reserved IPV6 addresses for multicast:
```
Address Description
```
```
FF02::1 The all-nodes address is used to reach all nodes on the same link.
```
```
FF02::2 The all-routers address is used to reach all routers on the same link.
```
```
FF02::5 The all-Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) router address is used to reach all OSPF routers on the same link.
```
```
FF02::6 The all-OSPF-designated router's address is used to reach all OSPF-designated routers on the same link.
```
```
FF02::1:
FFXX:
XXXX
```
```
The solicited-node address is used in the address resolution process to resolve the IPv6 address of a link-local node to its link-layer
address. The last 24 bits (XX:XXXX) of the solicited-node address are the last 24 bits of an IPv6 unicast address.
```
The following table is a partial list of IPv6 multicast addresses that are reserved for IPv6 multicasting and registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). For a complete list of assigned addresses read IANA document.
Multicast addresses can be used to discover nodes in a network. For example, discover all nodes
```
mrz@bumba:/media/aaa/ver$ ping6 ff02::1%eth0
PING ff02::1%eth0(ff02::1) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from fe80::20c:42ff:fe0d:2c38: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.44 ms (DUP!)
```
Anycast Address
An anycast address is a new type of address incorporated in IPv6.
Anycasting is a new networking paradigm supporting service-oriented Addresses where an identical address can be assigned to multiple nodes providing a
specific service. An anycast packet (i.e., one with an anycast destination address) is delivered to one of these nodes with the same anycast address.
An anycast address is not assigned a specific address range. It is assigned from the unicast address range.
Interface Identifier
The last 64 bits of an IPv6 address are the interface identifier that is unique to the 64-bit prefix of the IPv6 address. There are several ways how to
determine interface identifier:
```
EUI-64;
randomly generated to provide a level of anonymity;
manually configured.
```
EUI-64
Traditional interface identifiers for network adapters are 48-bit MAC addresses. This address consists of a 24-bit manufacturer ID and a 24-bit board ID.
IEEE EUI-64 is a new standard for network interface addresses. The company ID is still 24 bits in length, but the extension ID is 40 bits, creating a much
larger address space for network adapters.
To create a EUI-64 address from the interface MAC address:
```
0xFFFE is inserted into the MAC address between the manufacturer ID and the board ID.
The seventh bit of the first byte is reversed.
```
Let's make an example with the following MAC address 00:0C:42:28:79:45.
The image above illustrates the conversion process. When the result is converted to colon-hexadecimal notation, we get the interface identifier 20C:42FF:
FE28:7945. As a result, the corresponding link-local address is

### FE80::20C:42FF:FE28:7945/64
In RouterOS, if the EUI-64 parameter of an address is configured, the last 64 bits of that address will be automatically generated and updated using
interface identifier. The last bits must be configured to be zero for this case. Example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 address add address=fc00:3::/64 interface=ether3 eui-64=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, G - global, L - link-local
# ADDRESS INTERFACE ADVERTISE
...
5 G fc00:3::20c:42ff:fe1d:3d4/64 ether3 yes
[admin@MikroTik] > interface ethernet set ether3 mac-address=10:00:00:00:00:01
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, G - global, L - link-local
# ADDRESS INTERFACE ADVERTISE
...
5 G fc00:3::1200:ff:fe00:1/64 ether3 yes
```
Configuring IPv6 Address
This example shows how to set up simple addressing with global IPv6 addresses between two routers.
R1 configuration:
```
/ipv6 address
add address=2001:DB8::1/64 interface=ether1 advertise=no
```
R2 configuration:
```
/ipv6 address
add address=2001:DB8::2/64 interface=ether1 advertise=no
```
Check the address list:
```
[admin@R1] /ipv6 address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, G - global, L - link-local
# ADDRESS FROM-POOL INTERFACE ADVERTISE
0 G 2001:db8::1/64 ether1 no
3 DL fe80::219:d1ff:fe39:3535/64 ether1 no
```
Notice that our added address has a G flag indicating that this address can be globally routed. We also have a link-local address on the interface which is
created automatically for every IPv6-capable interface.
Test connectivity:
```
[admin@R1] /ipv6 address> /ping 2001:DB8::2
HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
2001:db8::2 56 64 12ms echo reply
2001:db8::2 56 64 0ms echo reply
sent=2 received=2 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=6ms max-rtt=12ms
```
SLAAC IPv6 Address
If under IPv6/Settings menu "accept-router-advertisements" option is enabled and the router receives a Router Advertisement packet, then the SLAAC
IPv6 address will be automatically assigned to the interface on which the advertisements were received. This address will have DG flags meaning that the
address is dynamic and global. Such addresses will show valid and lifetime parameters.
```
[admin@R1] /ipv6/address/print detail where dynamic && global
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic; G - global, L - link-local
0 DG address=2001:db8::::ba69:f4ff:fe84:545/64 from-pool="" interface=ether1
actual-interface=test_fp eui-64=no advertise=no no-dad=no valid=4w2d
preferred=1w
```
If SLAAC addresses are accepted, then also dynamic route toward the Internet will be generated. It will also contain a few limitations if specified on the
advertisement packet. For example, hop-limit and MTU. If multiple addresses are received on the same interface, then the lowest of the MTU values per
interface will be used.
```
[admin@R1] /routing/route/print detail where slaac
Flags: X - disabled, F - filtered, U - unreachable, A - active;

## Summary
Standards: RFC 2462, RFC 2461, RFC 4861
RouterOS has IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and stateless address autoconfiguration support using Router Advertisement Daemon (RADVD).

## Node description
Node is a device that implements IPv6. In IPv6 networks nodes are divided into two types:
```
Routers - a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself.
Hosts - any node that is not a router.
```
Routers and hosts are strictly separated, meaning that routers cannot be hosts and hosts cannot be routers at the same time.

## Stateless address autoconfiguration
There are several types of autoconfiguration:
```
stateless - address configuration is done by receiving Router Advertisement messages. These messages include stateless address prefixes and
require that host is not using stateful address configuration protocol.
stateful - address configuration is done by using the stateful address configuration protocol (DHCPv6). The stateful protocol is used if RA
messages do not include address prefixes.
both - RA messages include stateless address prefixes and require that hosts use a stateful address configuration protocol.
```
A highly useful feature of IPv6 is the ability to automatically configure itself without the use of a stateful configuration protocol like DHCP ( See example).
It is called stateless address autoconfiguration since there is no need to manage the state on the router side. It is a very simple, robust, and effective
autoconfiguration mechanism.
RouterOS uses RADVD to periodically advertise information about the link to all nodes on the same link. The information is carried by ICMPv6 "router
advertisement" packet, and includes the following fields:
```
IPv6 subnet prefix
Default router link-local address
Other parameters that may be optional: are link MTU, default hop limit, and router lifetime.
```
Then host catches the advertisement, and configures the global IPv6 address and the default router. Global IPv6 address is generated from the advertised
subnet prefix and EUI-64 interface identifier.
```
Address autoconfiguration can only be performed on multicast-capable interfaces.
```
Optionally, the host can ask for an advertisement from the router by sending an ICMPv6 "router solicitation" packet. On Linux rtsol utility transmits the
router solicitation packet. If you are running a mobile node, you may want to transmit router solicitations periodically.
Address states
When an auto-configuration address is assigned it can be in one of the following states:
```
tentative - in this state host verifies that the address is unique. Verification occurs through duplicate address detection.
preferred - at this state address is verified as unique and the node can send and receive unicast traffic to and from a preferred address. The
period of time of the preferred state is included in the RA message.
deprecated - the address is still valid, but is not used for new connections.
invalid - node can no longer send or receive unicast traffic. An address enters the invalid state after the valid lifetime expires.
```
The image above illustrates the relation between states and lifetimes.
Neighbor discovery
Sub-menu: /ipv6 nd
In this submenu, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol is configured.
Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a set of messages and processes that determine relationships between neighboring nodes. ND, compared to IPv4, replaces
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Router Discovery, and ICMP Redirect and provides additional functionality.
ND is used by hosts to:
```
Discover neighboring routers.
Discover addresses, address prefixes, and other configuration parameters.
```
ND is used by routers to:
```
Advertise their presence, host configuration parameters, and on-link prefixes.
Inform hosts of a better next-hop address to forward packets to a specific destination.
```
ND is used by nodes to:
```
Both resolve the link-layer address of a neighboring node to which an IPv6 packet is being forwarded and determine when the link-layer address
of a neighboring node has changed.
Determine whether IPv6 packets can be sent to and received from a neighbor.
```

If this option is specified, this prefix will be combined with the IPv4 address of the interface name to produce a valid 6to4 prefix. The
first 16 bits of this prefix will be replaced by 2002 and the next 32 bits of this prefix will be replaced by the IPv4 address assigned to
the interface name at configuration time. The remaining 80 bits of the prefix (including the SLA ID) will be advertised as specified in
the configuration file.

determined;
```
```
reachable - the neighbor is known to have been reachable recently (within tens of seconds ago);
```
```
stale - the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable but until traffic is sent to the neighbor, no attempt should
be made to verify its reachability;
```
```
delay - the neighbor is no longer known to be reachable, and traffic has recently been sent to the neighbor,
probes are delayed for a short period in order to give upper layer protocol a chance to provide reachability
confirmation;

Examples
Stateless autoconfiguration example
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, G - global, L - link-local
# ADDRESS INTERFACE ADVERTISE
0 G 2001:db8::1/64 ether1 yes
```
```
As an example, the advertise flag is enabled which indicates that dynamic/ipv6 nd prefixentry is added.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 nd prefix print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D prefix=2001:db8::/64 interface=ether1 on-link=yes autonomous=yes
valid-lifetime=4w2d preferred-lifetime=1w
```
On a host that is directly attached to the router, we see that an address was added. The address consists of the prefix part (first 64 bits) that takes the
prefix from the prefix advertisement, and the host part (last 64 bits) that is automatically generated from the local MAC address:
```
atis@atis-desktop:~$ ip -6 addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 16436
inet6 ::1/128 scope host
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
inet6 2001:db8::21a:4dff:fe56:1f4d/64 scope global dynamic
valid_lft 2588363sec preferred_lft 601163sec
inet6 fe80::21a:4dff:fe56:1f4d/64 scope link
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
```
The default maximum number of neighbor entries depends on the installed amount of RAM. It can be adjusted with the command "/ipv6
settings set max-neighbor-entries=x", see more details on IPv6 Settings.
```
The host has received the 2001:db8::/64 prefix from the router and configured an address with it.
There is also an option to redistribute DNS server information using RADVD:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip dns set server=2001:db8::2
[admin@MikroTik] > ip dns print servers: 2001:db8::2
...
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6 nd set [f] advertise-dns=yes
```
You will need a running client-side software with Router Advertisement DNS support to take advantage of the advertised DNS information.
On Ubuntu/Debian Linux distributions you can install rdnssd package which is capable of receiving the advertised DNS addresses.
```
mrz@bumba:/$ sudo apt-get install rdnssd
```
```
mrz@bumba:/$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)

## Overview
Routing is the process of selecting paths across the networks to move packets from one host to another.

## How Routing Works
Let's look at a basic configuration example to illustrate how routing is used to forward packets between two local networks and to the Internet.
In this setup, we have several networks:
```
two client networks (192.168.2.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24);
one network to connect routers (172.16.1.0/30), usually called backbone;
the last network (10.1.1.0/24) connects our gateway router (Router1) to the internet.
```
Router 2:
```
/ip address
add address=172.16.1.2/30 interface=ether1
add address=192.168.2.1/24 interface=bridge2
```
Router1 (gateway) where ether1 connects to the internet:
```
/ip address
add address=10.1.1.2/24 interface=ether1
add address=172.16.1.1/30 interface=ether2
add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
If we look, for example, at the Router1 routing table, we can see that the router knows only about directly connected networks. At this point, when the
Client from LAN1 tries to reach the client from LAN2 (192.168.2.0/24), a packet will be dropped on the router, because the destination is unknown for the
particular router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/route> print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - inactive, A - active; C - connect, S - static, r - ri
p, b - bgp, o - ospf, d - dhcp, v - vpn
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, Distance
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
DAC 10.1.1.0/24 ether1 0
DAC 172.16.1.0/30 ether2 0
DAC 192.168.1.0/24 bridge1 0
```
To fix this we need to add a route that tells the router what is the next device in the network to reach the destination.  In our example next hop is Router2,
so we need to add a route with the gateway that points to the Router's 2 connected address. This type of route is known as a static route:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip route add dst-address=192.168.2.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.2
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/route> print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - inactive, A - active; C - connect, S - static, r - ri
p, b - bgp, o - ospf, d - dhcp, v - vpn
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, Distance
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
DAC 10.1.1.0/24 ether1 0
DAC 172.16.1.0/30 ether2 0
DAC 192.168.1.0/24 bridge1 0
0 AS 192.168.2.0/24 172.16.1.2
```
At this point packet from LAN1 will be successfully forwarded to LAN2, but we are not over yet. Router2 does not know how to reach LAN1, so any packet
from LAN2 will be dropped on Router2.
If we look again at the network diagram, we can clearly see that Router2 has only one point of exit. It is safe to assume that all other unknown networks
should be reached over the link to Router1. The easiest way to do this is by adding a default route: To add a default route set destination 0.0.0.0/0 or leave
it blank:
```
/ip route add gateway=172.16.1.1
```
As we have seen from the example setup, there are different groups of routes, based on their origin and properties.
Routing Information
RouterOS routing information consists of two main parts:
```
FIB (Forwarding Information Base), is used to make packet forwarding decisions. It contains a copy of the necessary routing information.
RIB (Routing Information Base) contains all learned prefixes from routing protocols (connected, static, BGP, RIP, OSPF).
```
Routing Information Base
Routing Information Base is a database that lists entries for particular network destinations and their gateways (address of the next device along the path
or simply next-hop). One such entry in the routing table is called a route.
A hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network segment to another.
By default, all routes are organized in one "main" routing table. It is possible to make more than one routing table which we will discuss further in this
article, but for now, for sake of simplicity, we will consider that there is only one "main" routing table.
RIB table contains complete routing information, including static routes and policy routing rules configured by the user, routing information learned from
dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP), and information about connected networks.
Its purpose is not just to store routes, but also to filter routing information to calculate the best route for each destination prefix, to build and update the
Forwarding Information Base, and to distribute routes between different routing protocols.
Connected Routes
Connected routes represent the network on which hosts can be directly reached (direct attachment to Layer2 broadcast domain). These routes are created
automatically for each IP network that has at least one enabled interface attached to it (as specified in the /ip address or /ipv6 address configuration). RIB
tracks the status of connected routes but does not modify them. For each connected route there is one IP address item such that:
```
address part of the dst-address of the connected route is equal to a network of IP address item.
netmask part of dst-address of the connected route is equal to the netmask part of the address of the IP address item.
gateway of the connected route is equal to the actual-interface of the IP address item (same as an interface, except for bridge interface ports) and
represents an interface where directly connected hosts from the particular Layer3 network can be reached.
```
```
The preferred source is not used anymore for connected routes. FIB chooses the source address based on the out-interface. This allows
making setups that in ROS v6 and older were considered invalid. See examples for more details.
```
Default Route
A default route is used when the destination cannot be resolved by any other route in the routing table. In RouterOS dst-address of the default route is 0.0.0
.0/0 (for IPv4) and ::/0 (for IPv6) routes. If the routing table contains an active default route, then the routing table lookup in this table will never fail.
Typically home router routing table contains only connected networks and one default route to forward all outgoing traffic to the ISP's gateway:
```
[admin@TempTest] /ip/route> print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - inactive, A - active; C - connect, S - static, r - ri
p, b - bgp, o - ospf, d - dhcp, v - vpn
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, Distance
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
DAd 0.0.0.0/0 10.155.125.1 1
DAC 10.155.125.0/24 ether12 0
DAC 192.168.1.0/24 vlan2 0
```
Hardware Offloaded Route
Devices with Layer 3 Hardware Offloading (L3HW, otherwise known as IP switching or HW routing) allow offloading packet routing onto the switch chip.
When L3HW is enabled, such routes will display H-flag:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/route print where static
Flags: A - ACTIVE; s - STATIC, y - COPY; H - HW-OFFLOADED
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
0 AsH 0.0.0.0/0 172.16.2.1 1
1 AsH 10.0.0.0/8 10.155.121.254 1
2 AsH 192.168.3.0/24 172.16.2.1 1
```
By default, all the routes are participating to be hardware candidate routes. To further fine-tune which traffic to offload, there is an option for each IP or IPv6
static route to disable/enable suppress-hw-offload.
For example, if we know that the majority of traffic flows to the network where servers are located, we can enable offloading only to that specific destination:
```
/ip route set [find where static && dst-address!="192.168.3.0/24"] suppress-hw-offload=yes
```
Now only the route to 192.168.3.0/24 has an H-flag, indicating that it will be the only one eligible to be selected for HW offloading:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/route print where static
Flags: A - ACTIVE; s - STATIC, y - COPY; H - HW-OFFLOADED
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
0 As 0.0.0.0/0 172.16.2.1 1
1 As 10.0.0.0/8 10.155.121.254 1
2 AsH 192.168.3.0/24 172.16.2.1 1
```
Multipath (ECMP) routes
To implement some setups, such as load balancing, it might be necessary to use more than one path to a given destination.
```
H-flag does not indicate that the route is actually HW offloaded, it indicates only that route can be selected to be HW offloaded.
```
ECMP (Equal cost multi-path) routes have multiple gateways (next-hop) values. All reachable next-hops are copied to FIB and are used to forward packets.
These routes can be created manually, as well as dynamically by any of the dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP). Multiple equally preferred routes
to the same destination will have assigned + flag and grouped together automatically by RouterOS (see example below).
```
[admin@TempTest] /ip/route> print
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; I - INACTIVE, A - ACTIVE; C - CONNECT, S - STATIC, m - MODEM; + - ECMP
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
0 AS+ 192.168.2.0/24 10.155.125.1 1
1 AS+ 192.168.2.0/24 172.16.1.2 1
```
By default, ECMP uses Layer3 hash policy which hashes source IP and destination IP (for IPv4) or source IP, destination IP, flow label and IP protocol (for
IPv6).
It is possible to change hashing policies in /ip/setting and /ipv6/settings to Layer4 hashing or inner Layer3 hashing.
```
IPv4 IPv6
```
```
L3 srcIPv4, dstIPv4 srcIPv6, dstIPv6, flow label, IP proto
```
```
L4 srcIPv4, dstIPv4, srcPort, dstPort, IP proto srcIPv6, dstIPv6, srcPort, dstPort, IP Proto
```
```
L3-Inner
srcIPv4, dstIPv4 (if inner IPv4)
srcIPv6, dstIPv6, flow label, IP proto (if inner IPv6)
Same as L3 if inner is not present.
```
```
srcIPv4, dstIPv4 (if inner IPv4)
srcIPv6, dstIPv6, flow label, IP proto (if inner IPv6)
Same as L3 if inner is not present.
```
Route Selection
There can be multiple routes with the same destination received from various routing protocols and from static configurations but only one (best)
destination can be used for packet forwarding. To determine the best path, RIB runs a Route Selection algorithm that picks the best route from all
candidate routes per destination.
Only routes that meet the following criteria can participate in the route selection process:
```
Route is not disabled.
If the type of route is unicast it must have at least one reachable next-hop. ( if a gateway is from a connected network and there is a connected
route active, the gateway is considered as reachable)
Route should not be synthetic.
```
The candidate route with the lowest distance becomes an active route. If there is more than one candidate route with the same distance, the selection of
the active route is arbitrary.
Nexthop Lookup
Nexthop lookup is a part of the route selection process. Its
main purpose is to find a directly reachable gateway address
(next-hop). Only after a valid next-hop is selected router knows
which interface to use for packet forwarding.
Nexthop lookup becomes more complicated if routes have a
gateway address that is several hops away from this router (e.
g. iBGP, multihop eBGP). Such routes are installed in the FIB
after the next-hop selection algorithm determines the address
of the directly reachable gateway (immediate next-hop).
It is necessary to restrict the set of routes that can be used to
look up immediate next-hops. Nexthop values of RIP or OSPF
routes, for example, are supposed to be directly reachable and
should be looked up only using connected routes. This is
achieved using scope and target-scope properties.
Routes with a scope greater than the maximum accepted value
are not used for next-hop lookup. Each route specifies the
maximum accepted scope value for its nexthop in the target-
scope property. The default value of this property allows nexthop lookup only through connected routes, with the exception of iBGP routes that have a
larger default value and can lookup nexthop also through IGP and static routes.
There are changes in RouterOS v7 nexthop lookup.
Routes are processed in scope order, and updates to routes with a larger scope cannot affect the state of nexthop lookup for routes with a smaller scope.
Consider an example from v6:
```
/ip route add dst-address=10.0.1.0/24 gateway=10.0.0.1
scope=50 target-scope=30 comment=A
/ip route add dst-address=10.0.2.0/24 gateway=10.0.0.1
scope=30 target-scope=20 comment=B
/ip route add dst-address=10.0.0.0/24 scope=20 gateway=WHATEVER
comment=C
```
Gateway 10.0.0.1 is recursively resolved through C using the smallest referring scope (scope 20 from route B), both routes are active. Now we change
both A and B at the same time:
```
/ip route set A target-scope=10
```
Suddenly, applying an update to route A makes the gateway of route B inactive. This is because in v6 there is only one gateway object per address.
v7 keeps multiple gateway objects per address, one for each combination of scope and gateway check.
When target-scope or gateway check of a route is changed, ROS v7 will not affect other routes, as it does in v6. In v7 target-scope and gateway check
are properties that are internally attached to the gateway, not to the route.
Scope values considered as invalid and fixed automatically:
```
if gateway scope is set to 255 - RouterOS will internally fix this error by setting gateway scope to 254.
if route scope is less than gateway scope - RouterOS will internally fix this error by setting route scope to "gateway scope + 1"
```
Used actual scope and target scope values can be seen in /routing/nexthop menu
Gateway check can be extended by setting check-gateway parameter. Gateway reachability can be checked by sending ARP probes, or ICMP
messages or by checking active BFD sessions. The router periodically (every 10 seconds) checks the gateway by sending either an ICMP echo request (pi
ng) or an ARP request (arp). If no response from the gateway is received for 10 seconds, the request times out. After two timeouts gateway is considered
unreachable. After receiving a reply from the gateway it is considered reachable and the timeout counter is reset.
Route Storage
Routing information is stored to take as little memory as possible in a common case. These optimizations have non-obvious worst cases and impact on
performance.
All routes and gateways are kept in a single hierarchy by the prefix/address.

[subject to change without notice]
Each of these 'Dst' corresponds to a unique 'dst-address' of route or address of the gateway. Each 'Dst' requires one or more 'T2Node' objects as well.
All routes with the same 'dst-address' are kept in Dst in a list sorted by route preference.
Note: WORST CASE: having a lot of routes with the same 'dst-address' is really slow! even if they are inactive! because updating a sorted list with tens of
thousands of elements is slow!
Route order changes only when route attributes change. If the route becomes active/inactive, the order does not change.
Each Route has three copies of route attributes:
```
private -- what is received from the peer, before passing in-filters.
updated -- what is the result of applying in-filters.
current -- what are the attributes currently used by the route.
```
Periodically (when needed),
update attributes are
calculated from private attri
butes. This happens when
route update is received, or
when in-filter is updated.
When the routing table is
recalculated, current attribu
tes are set to the value from
updated attributes.
This means, that usually if
there is no in-filter that
changes route attributes, pri
vate, updated, and current
share the same value.
Route attributes are kept in
several groups:
```
L1 Data - all flags,
list of extra
properties, as-
path;
L2 Data -
nexthops, RIP,
OSPF, BGP
metrics, route
tags, originators,
etc.
L3 Data -
distance, scope,
kernel type,
MPLS stuff
extra properties -
communities,
originator,
aggregator-id,
cluster-list,
unknown
```
Having for example many different combinations of distance and scope route attributes will use more memory!
Matching communities or as-path using regexp will cache the result, to speed up filtering. Each as-path or community value has a cache for all regexp,
which is filled on-demand with match results.
Note: WORST CASE: changing attributes in 'in-filter' will make the route program use more memory! Because 'private' and 'updated' attributes will be
different! Having a lot of different regexps will make matching slow and use a lot of memory! Because each value will have a cache with thousands of
entries!
Detailed info about used memory by routing protocols can be seen in /routing stats memory menu
Forwarding Information Base
FIB (Forwarding Information Base) contains a copy of the information that is necessary for packet forwarding:
```
all active routes
policy routing rules
```
Each route has dst-address property, that specifies all destination addresses this route can be used for. If several routes apply to a particular IP address,
the most specific one (with the largest netmask) is used. This operation (finding the most specific route that matches the given address) is called ''routing
table lookup''.
Only one Best route can be used for packet forwarding. In cases where the routing table contains several routes with the same dst-address, all equally
best routes are combined into one ECMP route. The best route is installed into FIB and marked as ''active''.
When forwarding decision uses additional information, such as the source address of the packet, it is called policy routing. Policy routing is implemented as
a list of policy routing rules, that select different routing tables based on the destination address, source address, source interface, and routing mark (which
can be changed by firewall mangle rules) of the packet.
Routing table lookup
FIB uses the following information from the packet to determine its destination:
```
source address
destination address
source interface
routing mark
```
Possible routing decisions are:
```
receive packet locally
discard the packet (either silently or by sending an ICMP message to the sender of the packet)
```
```
send the packet to a specific IP address on a specific interface
```
Run routing decision:
```
check that the packet has to be locally delivered (the destination address is the address of the router)
process implicit policy routing rules
process policy routing rules added by a user
process implicit catch-all rule that looks up the destination in the ''main'' routing table
the returned result is "network unreachable"
```
The result of the routing decision can be:
```
IP address of nexthop + interface
point-to-point interface
local delivery
discard
ICMP prohibited
ICMP host unreachable
ICMP network unreachable
```
Rules that do not match the current packet are ignored. If a rule has action:
```
drop or unreachable, then it is returned as a result of the routing decision process.
lookup then the destination address of the packet is looked up in the routing table that is specified in the rule. If the lookup fails (no route matches
the destination address of the packet), then FIB proceeds to the next rule.
lookup-only is similar to lookup except that lookup fails if none of the routes in the table matches the packet.
```
Otherwise:
```
if the type of the route is blackhole, prohibit, or unreachable, then return this action as the routing decision result;
if this is a connected route or route with an interface as the gateway value, then return this interface and the destination address of the packet as
the routing decision result;
if this route has an IP address as the value of the gateway, then return this address and associated interface as the routing decision result;
if this route has multiple values of nexthop, then pick one of them in a round-robin fashion.
```
Show Routes
In RouterOS you have three menus to see the current state of routes in the routing table:
```
/ip route - list IPv4 routes and basic properties
/ipv6 route - list IPv6 routes and basic properties
/routing route - list all routes with extended properties
```
Example output
```
/routing route menu currently is read-only. To add or remove routes/ip(ipv6) route menus should be used.
```

Summary
IPv4 Settings
IPv6 Settings
```

## Summary
Several IPv4 and IPv6 related kernel and system-wide parameters are configurable.

## IPv4 Settings
Sub-menu: /ip settings
```
Property Description
```
```
accept-
redirects (yes
| no; Default:
no)
```
```
Whether to accept ICMP redirect messages. Typically should be enabled on a host and disabled on routers.
```
```
accept-
source-route (
yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to accept packets with the SRR option. Typically should be enabled on the router.
```
```
allow-fast-
path (yes | no
; Default: yes)
```
```
Allows Fast Path.
```
```
arp-timeout (ti
me interval;
Default: 30s)
```
```
Sets Linux base_reachable_time (base_reachable_time_ms) on all interfaces that use ARP. The initial validity of the ARP entry is
picked from the interval [timeout/2 - 3*timeout/2] (default from 15s to 45s) after the neighbor was found. Can use postfix ms, s, m, h, d
for milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days. if no postfix is set then seconds (s) are used. The parameter means how long a
valid ARP record will be considered complete if no one communicates with the specific MAC/IP during this time. The parameter does
not represent a time when an ARP entry is removed from the ARP cache (see max-neighbor-entries setting).
```
```
icmp-errors-
use-inbound-
interface-
address (yes
| no;
Default: no)
```
```
If enabled, the ICMP error message reply will be sent with the source address equal to primary address of the receiving interface that
caused the error. This feature can be useful for complex network debugging.
```
```
icmp-rate-
limit (integer
[0..
4294967295];
Default:  10 )
```
```
Limit the maximum rates for sending ICMP packets whose type matches icmp-rate-mask to specific targets. 0 disables any limiting,
other values indicate the minimum space between responses in milliseconds.
```
```
icmp-rate-
mask ([0..
FFFFFFFF];
Default: 0x18
18 )
```
```
Mask made of ICMP types for which rates are being limited. More info in Linux man pages
```
```
ip-forward (ye
s | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Enable/disable packet forwarding between interfaces. Resets all configuration parameters to defaults according to RFC1812 for
routers.
```
```
ipv4-
multipath-
hash-policy(l3
| l4 | l3-inner;
Default: l3)
```
```
IPv4 Hash policy used for ECMP routing in /ip/settings menu
```
```
l3 -- layer-3 hashing of src IP, dst IP
l3-inner -- layer-3 hashing or inner layer-3 hashing if available
l4 -- layer-4 hashing of src IP, dst IP, IP protocol, src port, dst port
```
```
rp-filter (loose
| no | strict;
Default: no)
```
```
Disables or enables source validation.
```
```
no - No source validation.
strict - Strict mode as defined in RFC3704 Strict Reverse Path. Each incoming packet is tested against the FIB and if the
interface is not the best reverse path the packet check will fail. By default failed packets are discarded.
loose - Loose mode as defined in RFC3704 Loose Reverse Path. Each incoming packet's source address is also tested against
the FIB and if the source address is not reachable via any interface the packet check will fail.
```
```
The current recommended practice in RFC3704 is to enable strict mode to prevent IP spoofing from DDoS attacks. If using
asymmetric routing or other complicated routing or VRRP, then the loose mode is recommended.
```
```
Warning: strict mode does not work with routing tables
```
```
secure-
redirects (yes
| no; Default:
yes)
```
```
Accept ICMP redirect messages only for gateways, listed in the default gateway list.
```
```
send-
redirects (yes
| no; Default:
yes)
```
```
Whether to send ICMP redirects. Recommended to be enabled on routers.
```
```
tcp-
timestamps (
disabled |
enabled |
random-offset
;
Default: rand
om-offset)
```
```
Parameter allows to enable/disable TCP timestamps or add random offset to TCP timestamp (default behavior). Disabling
timestamps completely may help to reduce spikes of performance drops.
```
```
tcp-
syncookies (y
es | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Send out syncookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket overflows. This is to prevent the common 'SYN flood attack'.
syncookies seriously violate TCP protocol, and disallow the use of TCP extensions, which can result in serious degradation of some
services (f.e. SMTP relaying), visible not by you, but to your clients and relays, contacting you.
```
```
max-
neighbor-
entries (integ
er [0..
4294967295];
Default: )
```
```
Sets Linux gc_thresh3. A maximum number of allowed neighbors in the ARP table. Since RouterOS version 7.1, the default value
depends on the installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default, but it increases the risk of out-of-
memory condition.
```
```
The default values for certain RAM sizes:
```
```
2048 for 64 MB,
4096 for 128 MB,
8192 for 256 MB,
16384 for 512 MB or higher.
```
```
The ARP cache stores ARP entries, and if some of these entries are incomplete, they can stay in the cache for an indefinite period of
time. This will only happen if the number of entries in the cache is less than one-fourth of the maximum number allowed. The reason
for this is to prevent the unnecessary running of the garbage-collector when the ARP table is not close to being full.
```
```
route-cache (
yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Disable or enable the Linux route cache. Note that disabling the route cache, will also disable the fast path.
```
Read-Only Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
ipv4-fast-path-active (yes | no) Indicates whether fast-path is active
```
```
ipv4-fast-path-bytes (integer) Amount of fast-pathed bytes
```
```
ipv4-fast-path-packets (integer) Amount of fast-pathed packets
```
```
ipv4-fasttrack-active (yes | no) Indicates whether fasttrack is active
```
```
ipv4-fasttrack-bytes (integer) Amount of fasttracked bytes
```
```
ipv4-fasttrack-packets (integer) Amount of fasttracked packet.
```
IPv6 Settings
Sub-menu: /ipv6 settings
```
Property Description
```
```
accept-redirects (no | yes-if-forwarding-
disabled; Default: yes-if-forwarding-disabled)
```
```
Whether to accept ICMP redirect messages. Typically should be enabled on the host and disabled on
routers
```
```
accept-router-advertisements (no | yes | yes-
if-forwarding-disabled; Default: yes-if-
forwarding-disabled)
```
```
Accept router advertisement (RA) messages. If enabled, the router will be able to get the address
using stateless address configuration
```
```
disable-ipv6 (yes | no; Default: no) Enable/disable system wide IPv6 settings (prevents LL address generation)
```
```
forward (yes | no; Default: yes) Enable/disable packet forwarding between interfaces
```
```
max-neighbor-entries (integer [0..
4294967295]; Default: )
```
```
A maximum number or IPv6 neighbors. Since RouterOS version 7.1, the default value depends on
the installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default, but it increases the
risk of out-of-memory condition.
```
```
The default values for certain RAM sizes:
```
```
1024 for 64 MB,
2048 for 128 MB,
4096 for 256 MB,
8192 for 512 MB,
16384 for 1024 MB or higher.
```
```
multipath-hash-policy (l3 | l4 | l3-inner;
Default: l3)
```
```
IPv6 Hash policy used for ECMP routing in /ipv6/settings menu
```
```
l3 -- layer-3 hashing of src IP, dst IP, flow label, IP protocol
l3-inner -- layer-3 hashing or inner layer-3 hashing if available
l4 -- layer-4 hashing of src IP, dst IP, IP protocol, src port, dst port
```
```
Changing /ipv6 settings will not dynamically remove the old SLAAC configuration present on your router. A reboot is required to apply the new
settings.
```


# Management tools
```
In This Section:
```
```
After successful RouterOS software installation (if it was needed) it is time to access the router for the first time. There are various ways how to
connect to it:
```
```
Command Line Interface (CLI) via Telnet, SSH, serial cable or keyboard and monitor if the router has VGA card.
Web interface (WebFig)
WinBox configuration utility
Using mobile utility (MikroTik mobile app)
```
```
Normally you connect to the router by IP addresses with any telnet or SSH client software (a simple text-mode telnet client is usually called telnet and
is distributed together with almost any OS).
```
```
If no IP or MAC connectivity is available, some devices allow connection through a serial port (DB9 or RJ45, depending on the model);
```
```
Accessing devices over serial console
```

## Summary
Application Programmable Interface (API) allows users to create custom software solutions to communicate with RouterOS to gather information, adjust
the configuration, and manage the router. API closely follows syntax from the command-line interface (CLI). It can be used to create translated or custom
configuration tools to aid ease of use in running and managing routers with RouterOS.
API service must be enabled before trying to establish the API connection. By default, API uses TCP: 8728 and TCP: 8729 (secure).
API-SSL service is capable of working in two modes - with and without a certificate. In the case no certificate is used in /ip service settings then an
anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher has to be used to establish a connection. If a certificate is in use, a TLS session can be established.

## Protocol
Communication with the router is done by sending sentences and receiving one or more sentences in return. A sentence is a sequence of words
terminated by zero-length words. Word is part of a sentence encoded in a certain way - encoded length and data. Communication happens by sending
sentences to the router and receiving replies to sent sentences. Each sentence sent to the router using API should contain a command as a first word
followed by words in no particular order, the end of the sentence is marked by a zero-length word. When the router receives a full sentence (command
word, no or more attribute words, and zero-length word) it is evaluated and executed, then a reply is formed and returned.

## API words
Words are part of a sentence. Each word has to be encoded in a certain way - the length of the word followed by the word content. The length of the word
should be given as a count of bytes that are going to be sent.
The length of the word is encoded as follows:
```
Value of length # of bytes Encoding
```
```
0 <= len <= 0x7F 1 len, lowest byte
```
```
0x80 <= len <= 0x3FFF 2 len | 0x8000, two lower bytes
```
```
0x4000 <= len <= 0x1FFFFF 3 len | 0xC00000, three lower bytes
```
```
0x200000 <= len <= 0xFFFFFFF 4 len | 0xE0000000
```
```
len >= 0x10000000 5 0xF0 and len as four bytes
```
```
Each word is encoded as length, followed by that many bytes of content;
Words are grouped into sentences. The end of a sentence is terminated by a zero-length word;
The scheme allows encoding of length up to 0x7FFFFFFFFF, only four-byte length is supported;
len bytes are sent most significant first (network order);
If the first byte of the word is >= 0xF8, then it is a reserved control byte. After receiving an unknown control byte API client cannot proceed,
because it does not know how to interpret the following bytes;
Currently, control bytes are not used;
```
In general, words can be described like this <<encoded word length><word content>>. Word content can be separated into 5 parts: command word, attribut
e word, API attribute word. query word, and reply word
Command word
The first word in the sentence has to be a command followed by attribute words and a zero-length word or terminating word. The name of the command
word should begin with '/'. Names of commands closely follow CLI, with spaces replaced with '/'. Some commands are specific to API;
Command word structure in the strict order:
```
encoded length
content prefix /
CLI converted command
```
API-specific commands:
```
login
cancel
```
Command word content examples:
```
/login
/user/active/listen
```
```
/interface/vlan/remove
```
```
/system/reboot
```
Attribute word
Each command word has its list of attribute words depending on content.
Attribute word structure consists of 5 parts in this order:
```
encoded length
content prefix equals sign - =
attribute name
separating equals sign - =
value of an attribute if there is one. It is possible that the attribute does not have a value
```
Examples without encoded length prefix:
```
Value can hold multiple equal signs in the value of an attribute word since the way the word is encoded.
```
```
Value can be empty.
```
```
=address=10.0.0.1
=name=iu=c3Eeg
```
```
=disable-running-check=yes
```
API attribute word
API attribute word structure is in the strict order:
```
encoded length
content prefix with the dot.
attribute name
name postfixed with equals =sign
attribute value
```
Currently, the only such API attribute is the tag.
Query word
Sentences can have additional query parameters that restrict their scope. A detailed explanation is in the query section.
Example of a sentence using query word attributes:
```
/interface/print
?type=ether
?type=vlan
?#|!
```
```
Query words begin with '?'.
Currently, only the print command handles query words.
```
Reply word
It is only sent by the router in response to the full sentence received from the client.
```
The first word of reply begins with '!';
Each sentence sent generates at least one reply (if a connection does not get terminated);
The last reply for every sentence is the reply that has the first word !done;
Errors and exceptional conditions begin with !trap;
Data replies begin with !re
If the API connection is closed, RouterOS sends !fatal with a reason as a reply and then closes the connection;
```
API sentences
API sentence is the main object of communication using API.
```
Empty sentences are ignored.
A sentence is processed after receiving zero length word.
There is a limit on the number and size of sentences that the client can send before it has logged in.
Order of attribute words should not be relied on. As order and count are changeable by .proplist attribute.
The sentence structure is as follows:
The first word should contain a command word;
```
```
Order of attribute words and API parameters is not important and should not be relied on
```
```
If the sentence contains an API attribute word tag then each returned sentence in reply from the router to that tagged sentence will be tagged
with the same tag.
```
```
The order of query words is significant
```
```
Should contain zero-length word to terminate the sentence;
Can contain none or several attribute words. There is no particular order in what attribute words have to be sent in the sentence, order is
not important for attribute words;
Can contain none or several query words. The order of query words in the sentence is important.
```
Initial login
Note: that each command and response ends with an empty word.
Login method post-v6.43:
```
/login
```
```
=name=admin
```
```
=password=
```
```
!done
```
```
Now the client sends a username and password in the first message.
Password is sent in plain text.
in case of an error, the reply contains =message=error message.
In case of a successful login, the client can start to issue commands.
```
Tags
```
It is possible to run several commands simultaneously, without waiting for the previous one to complete. If the API client is doing this and needs to
differentiate command responses, it can use the 'tag' API parameter in command sentences.
If you include the 'tag' parameter with a non-empty value in the command sentence, then the 'tag' parameter with the same value will be included
in all responses generated by this command.
If you do not include the 'tag' parameter or its value is empty, then all responses for this command will not have a 'tag' parameter.
```
Command description
```
/cancel
optional argument: =tag=tag of command to cancel, without it, cancels all running commands
does not cancel itself
all canceled commands are interrupted and in the usual case generate '!trap' and '!done' responses
please note that /cancel is separate command and can have its own unique '.tag' parameter, that is not related to '=tag' argument of this
command
```
```
listen
listen command is available where console print command is available, but it does not have the expected effect everywhere (i.e. may not
work)
"!re" sentences are generated as something changes in a particular item list
when an item is deleted or disappears in any other way, the '!re' sentence includes the value '=.dead=yes'
This command does not terminate. To terminate it, use /cancel command.
```
```
getall
getall command is available where console print command is available (getall is an alias for print).
replies contain =.id=Item internal number property.
```
```
print
API print command differs from the console counterpart in the following ways:
where an argument is not supported. Items can be filtered using query words (see below).
.proplist argument is a comma-separated list of property names that should be included for the returned items.
```
```
Zero-length word terminates the sentence. If it is not provided router will not start to evaluate sent words and will consider all the input as part of
the same sentence.
```
```
returned items may have additional properties.
order of returned properties is not defined.
if a list contains duplicate entries, handling of such entries is not defined.
if a property is present in ".proplist", but absent from the item, then that item does not have this property value (?name
will evaluate to false for that item).
if ".proplist" is absent, all properties are included as requested by the print command, even those that have slow
access time (such as file contents and performance counters). Thus the use of .proplist is encouraged. The omission
of .proplist may have a high-performance penalty if the "=detail=" argument is set.
```
Queries
The print command accepts query words that limit the set of returned sentences.
```
Query words begin with '?'.
The order of query words is significant. A query is evaluated starting from the first word.
A query is evaluated for each item in the list. If the query succeeds, the item is processed, if a query fails, the item is ignored.
A query is evaluated using a stack of boolean values. Initially, the stack contains an infinite amount of 'true' values. At the end of the evaluation, if
the stack contains at least one 'false' value, the query fails.
Query words operate according to the following rules:
```
```
Query Description
```
```
?name pushes 'true' if an item has a value of property name, 'false' if it does not.
```
```
?-name pushes 'true' if an item does not have a value of property name, 'false' otherwise.
```
```
?name=x
?=name=x
```
```
pushes 'true' if the property name has a value equal to x, 'false' otherwise.
```
```
?<name=x pushes 'true' if the property name has a value less than x, 'false' otherwise.
```
```
?>name=x pushes 'true' if the property name has a value greater than x, 'false' otherwise.
```
```
?#operations applies operations to the values in the stack.
```
```
operation string is evaluated from left to right.
the sequence of decimal digits followed by any other character or end of the word is interpreted as a stack index. top value has an
index 0.
an index that is followed by a character pushes a copy of the value at that index.
an index that is followed by the end of the word replaces all values with the value at that index.
! character replaces the top value with the opposite.
& pops two values and pushes the result of logical 'and' operation.
| pops two values and pushes the result of logical 'or' operation.
```
. after an index does nothing.
. after another character pushes a copy of the top value.
Examples:
```
Get all ethernet and VLAN interfaces:
```
```
/interface/print
?type=ether
?type=vlan
?#|
```
```
Get all routes that have a non-empty comment:
```
```
/ip/route/print
?>comment=
```
```
Regular expressions are not supported in API, so do not try to send a query with the ~ symbol
```
```
Forum thread with a detailed explanation of the use of queries
```
OID
The print command can return OID values for properties that are available in SNMP.
In the console, OID values can be seen by running the 'print oid' command. In API, these properties have a name that ends with ".oid", and can be
retrieved by adding their name to the value of '.proplist'. An example:
```
/system/resource/print
```
```
=.proplist=uptime,cpu-load,uptime.oid,cpu-load.oid
```
```
!re
```
```
=uptime=01:22:53
```
```
=cpu-load=0
```
```
=uptime.oid=.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0
```
```
=cpu-load.oid=.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.1.2.1
```
```
!done
```
!trap
When for some reason API sentence fails trap is sent in return accompanied by a message attribute and on some occasions category argument.
message
When an API sentence fails, some generic message or message from the used internal process is returned to give more details about the failure
```
<<< /ip/address/add
<<< =address=192.168.88.1
<<< =interface=asdf <<<
```
```
>>> !trap
>>> =category=1
>>> =message=input does not match any value of interface
```
category
if it is a general error, it is categorized and the error category is returned. possible values for this attribute are
```
0 - missing item or command
1 - argument value failure
2 - execution of command interrupted
3 - scripting related failure
4 - a general failure
5 - API related failure
6 - TTY related failure
7 - value generated with :return command
```

# Branding
RouterOS allows slight system customization with the help of a branding package (modify default configuration, LCD logo, WebFig homepage, etc.).
This is a special system package, which you can generate from within your mikrotik.com account, in the account section "Branding maker". The resulting
file will have a .dpk extension and can be installed by all the same means as an .npk package.
To install the package on a router, branding package has to upload to it and then a router has to reboot, Netinstall tool can be used for the same effect.
The generated package can be installed in any RouterOS version.

## Options
Options that can be configured using a branding package:
```
Router name - branding package name, device identity and platform name in RouterOS, can only be one word, don't use spaces or special
characters;
Company URL - value that appears in the console when you connect to RouterOS device;
Manual URL - documentation link, which can be opened in WebFig;
ASCII Logo - a text logo that is shown when logging into the command line interface, i.e. Telnet, SSH, WinBox Terminal. A logo can be created in
the branding maker or copied from any other plaintext editor. A logo height cannot be larger than 8 lines, width is not limited, but note that in a narr
ow terminal window a logo might be distorted.
Hide "Mikrotik" from SNMP information - MikroTik name will be hidden in SNMP information;
Do not run script on install - do not run Default configuration script on branding package install;
Hide Default configuration prompt - hide Default configuration prompt after configuration reset (available starting from RouterOS 7.15)
Hide default caps-mode-script - hide default caps-mode-script (available starting from RouterOS 7.15)
```

## Custom files
A custom files like custom default configuration, skins, WebFig login page, etc., can be added in branding package.
```
WebFig login page -  customized a default RouterOS information page, which shows up when accessing the router IP address. When making the
HTML file, you can use these variables:
%version% will change to the router's current version;
%host% will change to the router's IP address.
```
```
The file must be named "index2.html". Make sure you use properly nested HTML to make your page compatible with all browsers.
```
```
You can also upload images or JavaScript files, they must reference to the same path as the index file, no custom folder names can be used.
To overwrite MikroTik logo in WebFig login page, upload your custom logo - a logo should be named "mikrotik_logo.png";
```
```
WebFig logo  - Router WEB page (configuration page) logo;
\hotspot -  Hotspot login page logo, the file must be named "logobottom.png";
\skins - a skin file with name your_file_name.json. To apply a particular skin to a specific user group, you don't need to log into the router to do
that. You can do it with branding by uploading a Default configuration file;
Default configuration - a RouterOS default configuration file that will override RouterOS default configuration. This configuration will be kept even
after RouterOS reset. It is possible to reapply the factory passwords by utilizing the read-only variables $defconfPassword and $defconfWifiPassw
ord (access to factory passwords is available starting RouterOS 7.10);
LCD logo - LCD logo will be displayed on devices equipped with LCD screen. A Logo size cannot be larger than 160px width and 72px height. CC
R1xxx series has white (0xffffff) background, 2011 series have black (0x000000) background;
Custom files - custom files will be simply copied into a folder named "branding" and will be accessible from within RouterOS.
CAPs mode script - a RouterOS CAPs mode script that will override RouterOS default CAPs mode script. It is possible to reapply the factory
passwords by utilizing the read-only variables $defconfPassword and $defconfWifiPassword (available starting from RouterOS 7.15).
```
```
Note that specific branding features are available starting from specific RouterOS versions.
```
```
To use percent sign as text or formatting value in "index2.html", double % must be used, example - width: 70%%
```
If a Default configuration or CAPs mode script execution takes more than 2 minutes, a script will fail, and LOG will contain "runtime limit
exceeded" or in rare cases "std failure: timeout" error.

```
The console is used for accessing the MikroTik Router's configuration and management features using text terminals, either remotely using a serial port,
telnet, SSH, console screen within WinBox, or directly using monitor and keyboard. The console is also used for writing scripts. This manual describes the
general console operation principles. Please consult the Scripting Manual on some advanced console commands and on how to write scripts.

## Login Options
Console login options enable or disable various console features like color, terminal detection, and many other.
Additional login parameters can be appended to the login name after the '+' sign.
login_name ::= user_name [ '+' parameters ]
parameters ::= parameter [ parameters ]
parameter ::= [ number ] 'a'..'z'
number ::= '0'..'9' [ number ]
If the parameter is not present, then the default value is used. If the number is not present then the implicit value of the parameter is used.
Example: admin+ct80w - will disable console colors, disable auto detection and then set terminal width to 80.
```
Param Default Implicit Description
```
```
"w" auto auto Set terminal width
```
```
"h" auto auto Set terminal height
```
```
"c" on off disable/enable console colors
```
```
"t" off off Disable auto-detection of terminal capabilities
```
```
"e" on off Enables "dumb" terminal mode
```

## Banner and Messages
The login process will display the MikroTik banner and short help after validating the user name and password.

```
Command Prompt
At the end of the successful login sequence, the login process prints a banner that shows the command prompt, and hands over control to the user.
Default command prompt consists of user name, system identity, and current command path />
For example, change the current path from the root to the interface then go back to the root
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface [enter]
[admin@MikroTik] /interface> / [enter]
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
Use up arrow to recall previous commands (if this is a multiline command, then you can press F8 in order to expand it) from command history (commands
that added sensitive data, like passwords, will not be available in the history), TAB key to automatically complete words in the command you are typing, EN
TER key to execute the command, Control-C to interrupt currently running command and return to prompt and? to display built-in help, in RouterOS v7, F1
has to be used instead.
The easiest way to log out of the console is to press Control-D at the command prompt while the command line is empty (You can cancel the current
command and get an empty line with Control-C, so Control-C followed by Control-D will log you out in most cases).
It is possible to write commands that consist of multiple lines. When the entered line is not a complete command and more input is expected, the console
shows a continuation prompt that lists all open parentheses, braces, brackets, and quotes, and also trailing backslash if the previous line ended with backsl
ash-white-space.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > {
{... :put (\
{(\... 1+2)}
3
```
When you are editing such multiple line entries, the prompt shows the number of current lines and total line count instead of the usual username and
system name.
line 2 of 3> :put (\
Sometimes commands ask for additional input from the user. For example, the command '/password' asks for old and new passwords. In such cases, the
prompt shows the name of the requested value, followed by colon and space.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /password
old password: ******
new password: **********
retype new password: **********
```
Hierarchy
The console allows the configuration of the router's settings using text commands. Since there is a lot of available commands, they are split into groups
organized in a way of hierarchical menu levels. The name of a menu level reflects the configuration information accessible in the relevant section.
For example, you can issue the /ip route print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip route print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - inactive, A - active;
C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, d - dhcp, v - vpn

Instead of typing `/ip route` path before each command, the path can be typed only once to move into this particular branch of the menu hierarchy. Thus,
the example above could also be executed like this:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip route

Item Names and Numbers
Many of the command levels operate with arrays of items: interfaces, routes, users, etc. Such arrays are displayed in similarly-looking lists. All items in the
list have an item number followed by flags and parameter values.
To change the properties of an item, you have to use the set command and specify the name or number of the item.
Item Names
Some lists have items with specific names assigned to each of them. Examples are interface or user levels. There you can use item names instead of item
numbers.
You do not have to use the print command before accessing items by their names, which, as opposed to numbers, are not assigned by the console
internally, but are properties of the items. Thus, they would not change on their own. However, there are all kinds of obscure situations possible when
several users are changing the router's configuration at the same time. Generally, item names are more "stable" than the numbers, and also more
informative, so you should prefer them to numbers when writing console scripts.
Item Numbers
Item numbers are assigned by the print command and are not constant - it is possible that two successive print commands will order items differently. But
the results of the last print commands are memorized and, thus, once assigned, item numbers can be used even after add, remove and move operations
(since version 3, move operation does not renumber items). Item numbers are assigned on a per session basis, they will remain the same until you quit the
console or until the next print command is executed. Also, numbers are assigned separately for every item list, so /ip address print will not change
the numbering of the interface list.
You can specify multiple items as targets to some commands. Almost everywhere, where you can write the number of items, you can also write a list of
numbers.

General Commands
There are some commands that are common to nearly all menu levels, namely: print, set, remove, add, find, get, export, enable, disable, comment, move.
These commands have similar behavior throughout different menu levels.
```
Property Description
```
```
add This command usually has all the same arguments as a set, except the item number argument. It adds a new item with the values you
have specified, usually at the end of the item list, in places where the order of items is relevant. There are some required properties that
you have to supply, such as the interface for a new address, while other properties are set to defaults unless you explicitly specify them.
Common Parameters
```
```
copy-from - Copies an existing item. It takes default values of a new item's properties from another item. If you do not want to make an
exact copy, you can specify new values for some properties. When copying items that have names, you will usually have to give a
new name to a copy
place-before - places a new item before an existing item with a specified position. Thus, you do not need to use the move command
after adding an item to the list
disabled - controls disabled/enabled state of the newly added item(-s)
comment - holds the description of a newly created item
```
```
Return Values
```
```
add command returns the internal number of items it has added
```
```
edit This command is associated with the set command. It can be used to edit values of properties that contain a large amount of text, such as
scripts, but it works with all editable properties. Depending on the capabilities of the terminal, either a full-screen editor or a single line
editor is launched to edit the value of the specified property.
```
```
find The find command has the same arguments as a set, plus the flag arguments like disabled or active that take values yes or no depending
on the value of the respective flag. To see all flags and their names, look at the top of the print command's output. The find command
returns internal numbers of all items that have the same values of arguments as specified.
```
```
move Changes the order of items in the list. Parameters:
```
```
the first argument specifies the item(-s) being moved.
the second argument specifies the item before which to place all items being moved (they are placed at the end of the list if the
second argument is omitted).
```
```
print Shows all information that's accessible from a particular command level. Thus, /system clock print shows the system date and time,
/ip route print shows all routes etc. If there\'s a list of items in the current level and they are not read-only, i.e. you can change
/remove them (example of read-only item list is /system history, which shows a history of executed actions), then print command also
assigns numbers that are used by all commands that operate with items in this list.
```
```
Common Parameters:
```
```
append -
brief - forces the print command to use tabular output form
count-only - shows the number of items
detail - forces the print command to use property=value output form
file - prints the contents of the specific sub-menu into a file on the router.
follow -
follow-only -
follow-strict -
from - show only specified items, in the same order in which they are given.
interval - updates the output from the print command for every interval of seconds.
oid - prints the OID value for properties that are accessible from SNMP.
proplist - comma-separated and ordered list of property names that should be included for the returned items.
show-ids -
where - show only items that match specified criteria. The syntax of where the property is similar to the find command.
without-paging - prints the output without stopping after each screenful.
```
```
remove Removes specified item(-s) from a list.
```
```
set Allows you to change values of general parameters or item parameters. The set command has arguments with names corresponding to
values you can change. Use? or double Tab to see a list of all arguments. If there is a list of items in this command level, then the set has
one action argument that accepts the number of items (or list of numbers) you wish to set up. This command does not return anything.
```
Input Modes
It is possible to switch between several input modes:
```
Normal mode - indicated by normal command prompt.
Safe mode - safe mode is indicated by the word SAFE after the command prompt. In this mode, the configuration is saved to disk only after the
safe mode is turned off. Safe mode can be turned on/off with Ctrl+X or F4. Read more >>
Hot-lock mode - indicated by additional yellow >. Hot-lock mode autocompletes commands and can be turned on/off with F7
```
Quick Typing
There are two features in the console that help entering commands much quicker and easier - the [Tab] key completions, and abbreviations of command
names. Completions work similarly to the bash shell in UNIX. If you press the [Tab] key after a part of a word, the console tries to find the command within
the current context that begins with this word. If there is only one match, it is automatically appended, followed by a space:
/inte[Tab]_ becomes /interface _
If there is more than one match, but they all have a common beginning, which is longer than that what you have typed, then the word is completed to this
common part, and no space is appended:
/interface set e[Tab]_ becomes /interface set ether_
If you've typed just the common part, pressing the tab key once has no effect. However, pressing it for the second time shows all possible completions in
compact form:
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set e[Tab]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether[Tab]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether[Tab]_
ether1 ether5
[admin@MikroTik] > interface set ether_
The [Tab] key can be used almost in any context where the console might have a clue about possible values - command names, argument names,
arguments that have only several possible values (like names of items in some lists or name of the protocol in firewall and NAT rules). You cannot
complete numbers, IP addresses, and similar values.
Another way to press fewer keys while typing is to abbreviate command and argument names. You can type only the beginning of the command name,
and, if it is not ambiguous, the console will accept it as a full name. So typing:
[admin@MikroTik] > pi 10.1 c 3 si 100
equals to:
[admin@MikroTik] > ping 10.0.0.1 count 3 size 100
It is possible to complete not only the beginning, but also any distinctive sub-string of a name: if there is no exact match, the console starts looking for
words that have string being completed as first letters of a multiple word name, or that simply contain letters of this string in the same order. If a single such
word is found, it is completed at the cursor position. For example:
[admin@MikroTik] > interface x[TAB]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface export _
[admin@MikroTik] > interface mt[TAB]_
[admin@MikroTik] > interface monitor-traffic _
Console Search
Console search allows performing keyword search through the list of RouterOS menus and the history. The search prompt is accessible with the [Ctrl+r] sh
ortcut.
Internal Chat System
RouterOS console has a built-in internal chat system. This allows remotely located admins to talk to each other directly in RouterOS CLI. To start the
conversation prefix the intended message with the # symbol, anyone who is logged in at the time of sending the message will see it.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > # ready to break internet?
[admin@MikroTik] >
fake_admin: i was born ready
[admin@MikroTik] >
```
```
[fake_admin@MikroTik] >
admin: ready to break internet?

# MAC server
MAC server section allows you to configure MAC Telnet Server, MAC WinBox Server and MAC Ping Server on RouterOS device.
MAC Telnet is used to provide access to a router that has no IP address set. It works just like IP telnet. MAC telnet is possible between two MikroTik
RouterOS routers only.
MAC WinBox is used to provide Winbox access to the router via MAC address.
MAC Ping is used to allow MAC pings to the router's MAC address.

## MAC Telnet Server
It is possible to set MAC Telnet access to specific interfaces that are a part of the interface list:
```
[admin@device] /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=listBridge
[admin@device] /tool mac-server print
allowed-interface-list: listBridge
```
In the example above, MAC Telnet is configured for the interface list "listBridge" and, as a result, MAC Telnet will only work via the interfaces that are
members of the list (you can add multiple interfaces to the list).
To disable MAC Telnet access, issue the command (set "allowed-interface-list" to "none"):
```
[admin@device] /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=none
[admin@device] /tool mac-server print
allowed-interface-list: none
```
You can check active MAC Telnet sessions (that the device accepted) with the command:
```
[admin@device] > tool mac-server sessions print
Columns: INTERFACE, SRC-ADDRESS, UPTIME
# INTERFACE SRC-ADDRESS UPTIME
0 ether5 64:D1:54:FB:E3:E6 17s
```

## MAC Telnet Client
When MAC Telnet Server is enabled, you can use another RouterOS device to connect to the server using the mac-telnet client:
```
MAC-server settings are included in the "system" package.
```
```
[admin@device2] > tool mac-telnet B8:69:F4:7F:F2:E7
Login: admin
Password:
Trying B8:69:F4:7F:F2:E7...
Connected to B8:69:F4:7F:F2:E7

Press F1 for help
```
```

```
Change the MAC address accordingly (to your setup) and you should get into the server's CLI (as shown in the example above).
MAC Scan
Mac scan feature discovers all devices, which support MAC telnet protocol on the given network. The command requires you to select an interface that
should be scanned:
```
[admin@Sw_Denissm] > tool mac-scan interface=all
MAC-ADDRESS ADDRESS AGE
B8:69:F4:7F:F2:E7 192.168.69.1 26
2C:C8:1B:FD:F2:C3 192.168.69.3 56
```
In the example, above, all interfaces are chosen, and the scan will run infinitely unless stopped (by pressing "q").
You can also add a "duration" parameter that will dictate for how long the scan should go on:
```
[admin@Sw_Denissm] > tool mac-scan interface=all duration=1
MAC-ADDRESS ADDRESS AGE
B8:69:F4:7F:F2:E7 192.168.69.1 48
2C:C8:1B:FD:F2:C3 192.168.69.3 17
```
In the example above, we set the "duration" parameter to 1 second.
MAC WinBox Server
Same as with MAC Telnet, it is possible to set MAC WinBox access to specific interfaces that are a part of the interface list:
```
[admin@device] > tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=listBridge
[admin@device] > tool mac-server mac-winbox print
allowed-interface-list: listBridge
```
In the example above, MAC WinBox access is configured for the interface list "listBridge" and, as a result, MAC WinBox will only work via the interfaces
that are members of the list.
To disable MAC WinBox access, issue the command (set "allowed-interface-list" to "none"):
```
[admin@device] > tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=none
[admin@device] > tool mac-server mac-winbox print
allowed-interface-list: none
```
MAC Ping Server
MAC Ping Server can be either set to be "disabled" or "enabled":
```
[admin@device] > tool mac-server ping print
enabled: yes
```
You can enable or disable MAC ping with the help of the commands (enable=yes → to enable the feature; enable=no → to disable the feature):
```
[admin@device] > tool mac-server ping set enabled=yes
[admin@device] > tool mac-server ping set enabled=no
```
When MAC Ping is enabled, other hosts on the same broadcast domain can use ping tool to ping the mac address. For example, you can issue the
following command to check MAC ping results:
```
[admin@device] > /ping 00:0C:42:72:A1:B0
HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
00:0C:42:72:A1:B0 56 0ms
00:0C:42:72:A1:B0 56 0ms
sent=2 received=2 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```

## Summary
Quickset is a simple configuration wizard page that prepares your router in a few clicks. It is the first screen a user sees, when opening the default IP
address 192.168.88.1 in a web browser.
Quickset is available for all devices that have some sort of default configuration from factory. Devices that do not have configuration must be configured by
hand. The most popular and recommended mode is the HomeAP (or HomeAP dual, depending on the device). This Quickset mode provides the simplest
of terminology and the most common options for the home user.

## Modes
Depending on the router model, different Quickset modes might be available from the Quickset dropdown menu:
```
CAP: Controlled Access Point, an AP device, that will be managed by a centralized CAPsMAN server. Only use if you have already set up a
CAPsMAN server.
CPE: Client device, which will connect to an Access Point (AP) device. Provides option to scan for AP devices in your area.
HomeAP: The default Access Point config page for most home users. Provides fewer options and simplified terminology.
HomeAP dual: Dual band devices (2GHz/5GHz). The default Access Point config page for most home users. Provides fewer options and
simplified terminology.
Home Mesh: Made for making bigger WiFi networks. Enables the CAPsMAN server in the router, and places the local WiFi interfaces under
CAPsMAN control. Just boot other MikroTik WiFi APs with the reset button pressed, and they will join this HomeMesh network (see their Quick
guide for details)
PTP Bridge AP: When you need to transparently interconnect two remote locations together in the same network, set one device to this mode,
and the other device to the next (PTP Bridge CPE) mode.
PTP Bridge CPE: When you need to transparently interconnect two remote locations together in the same network, set one device to this mode,
and the other device to the previous (PTP Bridge AP) mode.
WISP AP: Similar to the HomeAP mode, but provides more advanced options and uses industry standard terminology, like SSID and WPA.
```

## HomeAP
This is the mode you should use if you would like to quickly configure a home access point.

## Wireless
Set up your wireless network in this section:
```
Network Name: How will your smartphone see your network? Set any name you like here. In HomeAP dual, you can set the 2GHz (legacy) and
5GHz (modern) networks to same, or different names (see FAQ). Use any name you like, in any format.
Frequency: Normally you can leave "Auto", in this way, the router will scan the environment, and select the least occupied frequency channel (it
will do this once). Use a custom selection if you need to experiment.
Band: Normally leave this to defaults (2GHz b/g/n and 5GHz A/N/AC).
Use Access List (ACL): Enable this if you would like to restrict who can connect to your AP, based on the user's MAC (hardware) address. To use
this option, first you need to allow these clients to connect, and then use the below button "Copy to ACL". This will copy the selected client to the
access list. After you have built an Access list (ACL), you can enable this option to forbid anyone else to attempt connections to your device.
Normally you can leave this alone, as the Wireless password already provides the needed restrictions.
WiFi Password: The most important option here. Sets a secure password that also encrypts your wireless communications, which will be needed
to connect to wireless network.
```
```
WPS accept: Use this button to grant access to a specific device that supports the WPS connection mode. Useful for printers and other
peripherals where typing a password is difficult. First start WPS mode in your client device, then once click the WPS button here to allow said
device. Button works for a few seconds and operates on a per-client basis.
Guest network: Useful for house guests who don't need to know your main WiFi password. Set a separate password for them in this option.
Important! Guest users will not be able to access other devices in your LAN and other guest devices. This mode enabled Bridge filters to prevent
this.
Wireless clients: This table shows the currently connected client devices (their MAC address, if they are in your Access List, their last used IP
address, how long are they connected, their signal level in dBm and in a bar graph).
```
Internet
```
Port: Select which port is connected to the ISP (internet) modem. Usually Eth1.
Address Acquisition: Select how the ISP is giving you the IP address. Ask your service provider about this and the other options (IP address,
Netmask, Gateway).
MAC address: Normally should not be changed, unless your ISP has locked you to a specific MAC address, and you have changed the router to
a new one.
Firewall router: This enables a secure firewall for your router and your network. Always make sure this box is selected, so that no access is
possible to your devices from the internet port.
MAC server / MAC Winbox: Allows connection with the [Winbox utility https://mt.lv/winbox] from the LAN port side in MAC address mode. Useful
for debugging and recovery, when IP mode is not available. Advanced use only.
Discovery: Allows the device to be identified by model name from other RouterOS devices.
```
Local Network
```
IP address: Mostly can stay at the default 192.168.88.1 unless your router is behind another router. To avoid IP conflict, change to 192.168.89.1
or similar
Netmask: In most situations can leave 255.255.255.0
Bridge all LAN ports: Allows your devices to communicate to each other, even if, say, your TV is connected via Ethernet LAN cable, but your PC
is connected via WiFi.
DHCP server: Normally, you would want automatic IP address configuration in your home network, so leave the DHCP settings ON and on their
defaults.
NAT: Turn this off ONLY if your ISP has provided a public IP address for both the router and also the local network. If not, leave NAT on.
UPnP: This option enables automatic port forwarding ("opening ports to the local network" as some call it) for supported programs and devices,
like your NAS disks and peer-to-peer utilities. Use with care, as this option can sometimes expose internal devices to the internet without your
knowledge. Enable only if specifically needed.
```
VPN
If you want to access your local network (and your router) from the internet, use a secure VPN tunnel. This option gives you a domain name where to
connect to, and enables PPTP and L2TP/IPsec (the second one is recommended). The username is 'vpn' and you can specify your own password. All you
need to do is enable it here, and then provide the address, username and password in your laptop or phone, and when connected to the VPN, you will
have a securely encrypted connection to your home network. Also, useful when travelling - you will be able to browse the internet through a secure line, as
if connecting from your home. This also helps to avoid geographical restrictions that are set up in some countries.
System
```
Check for updates: Always make sure your device is up-to-date with this button. Checks if an updated RouterOS release is available, and installs
it.
Password: Sets the password for the device config page itself. Make sure nobody can access your router config page and change the settings.
```
FAQ
Q: How is Quickset different from the Webfig tab, where a bunch of new menus appear?
A: QuickSet is for new users who only need their device up and running in no time. It provides the most commonly used options in one place. If you need
more options, do not use any Quickset settings at all, click on "Webfig" to open the advanced configuration interface. The full functionality is unlocked.
Q: Can I use Quickset and Webfig together? While settings that are not conflicting can be configured this way, it is not recommended to mix up these
menus.
A: If you are going to use Quickset, use only Quickset and vice versa. What is difference between Router and Bridge mode? Bridge mode adds all
interfaces to the bridge, allowing to forward Layer2 packets (acts as a hub/switch). In Router mode, packets are forwarded in Layer3 by using IP addresses
and IP routes (acts as a router).
Q: In HomeAP mode, should the 2GHz and 5GHz network names be the same, or different?
A: If you prefer that all your client devices, like TV, phones, game consoles, would automatically select the best preferred network, set the names
identically. If you would like to force a client device to use the faster 5GHz 802.11ac connection, set the names unique.
Q: Can I create an AP without security settings - no password or connect to such AP while using QuickSet?
A: QuickSet uses WPA2 pre-shared key by default. It means that the minimal password length is 8 symbols and the device can only connect to WPA2
secured AP or serve as AP itself. For configurations with no security settings, you need to configure them manually using WinBox, Webfig, or console.

## Overview
Watch our video about this feature.
The term "REST API" generally refers to an API accessed via HTTP protocol at a predefined set of resource-oriented URLs.
Starting from RouterOS v7.1beta4, it is implemented as a JSON wrapper interface of the console API. It allows to create, read, update and delete
resources and call arbitrary console commands.
To start using REST API, the www-ssl or www (starting with RouterOS v7.9) service must be configured and running. When the www-ssl service (HTTPS
access) is enabled, the REST service can be accessed by connecting to https://<routers_IP>/rest. When www service (HTTP access) is enabled
the REST service can be accessed by connecting to [http://<routers_IP>/rest.](http://<routers_IP>/rest.)
The easiest way to start is to use cURL, wget, or any other HTTP client even RouterOS fetch tool.

```
Watch how to set up REST api.

## Authentication
Authentication to the REST API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your Username and password are the same as for the console user (by default
"admin" with no password).

## JSON format
Server broadly follows ECMA-404 standard, with following notes:
```
In JSON replies all object values are encoded as strings, even if the underlying data is a number or a boolean.
```
```
We do not advise enabling HTTP access (www service). The main risk is that authentication credentials can be read with passive
eavesdropping. You can use it only when performing tests (not in a production environment) and when you are certain that nobody can listen in
(inspect your traffic)!
```
```
You have to set up certificates to use secure HTTPS, if self-signed certs are used, then CA must be imported to the trusted root. However, for
testing purposes, it is possible to connect insecurely (for cUrl use -k flag, for wget use --no-check-certificate).
```
```
The server also accepts numbers in octal format (begins with 0) and hexadecimal format (begins with 0x). If the numbers are sent in a string
format, they are assumed to be in decimal format.
Numbers with exponents are not supported.
```
HTTP Methods
Below is a table summarising supported HTTP methods
```
HTTP Verv CRUD ROS Description
```
```
GET Read print To get the records.
```
```
PATCH Update/Modify set To update a single record.
```
```
PUT Create add To create a new record.
```
```
DELETE Delete remove To delete a single record.
```
```
POST Universal method to get access to all console commands.
```
GET
This method allows getting the list of all records or a single record from the specified menu encoded in the URL.
For example, get all IP addresses (equivalent to the 'ip/address/print' command from the CLI):
```
$ curl -k -u admin: https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address
[{".id":"*1","actual-interface":"ether2","address":"10.0.0.111/24","disabled":"false",
"dynamic":"false","interface":"ether2","invalid":"false","network":"10.0.0.0"},
{".id":"*2","actual-interface":"ether3","address":"10.0.0.109/24","disabled":"true",
"dynamic":"false","interface":"ether3","invalid":"false","network":"10.0.0.0"}]
```
To return a single record, append the ID at the end of the URL:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/*1
{".id":"*1","actual-interface":"ether2","address":"10.0.0.111/24","disabled":"false",
"dynamic":"false","interface":"ether2","invalid":"false","network":"10.0.0.0"}
```
If table contains named parameters, then name instread of ID can be used, for example, get ether1:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: https://10.155.101.214/rest/interface/ether1
```
It is also possible to filter the output, for example, return only valid addresses that belong to the 10.155.101.0 network:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: "https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address?network=10.155.101.0&dynamic=true"
[{".id":"*8","actual-interface":"sfp12","address":"10.155.101.214/24","disabled":"false",
"dynamic":"true","interface":"sfp12","invalid":"false","network":"10.155.101.0"}]
```
Another example returns only addresses on the "dummy" interface and with the comment "test":
```
$ curl -k -u admin: 'https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address?comment=test&interface=dummy'
[{".id":"*3","actual-interface":"dummy","address":"192.168.99.2/24","comment":"test",
"disabled":"false","dynamic":"false","interface":"dummy","invalid":"false","network":"192.168.99.0"}]
```
If you want to return only specific properties, you can use the '.proplist', followed by the '=' and a list of comma-separated properties. For example, to
show only the address and if it's disabled:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address?.proplist=address,disabled
[{"address":"10.0.0.111/24","disabled":"false"},{"address":"10.0.0.109/24","disabled":"true"}]
```
PATCH
This method is used to update a single record. Set PATCH call body as a JSON object which contains fields and values of the properties to be updated.
For example, add a comment:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X PATCH https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/*3 \
--data '{"comment": "test"}' -H "content-type: application/json"
{".id":"*3","actual-interface":"dummy","address":"192.168.99.2/24","comment":"test",
"disabled":"false","dynamic":"false","interface":"dummy","invalid":"false","network":"192.168.99.0"}
```
In case of a successful update, the server returns the updated object with all its parameters.
PUT
A method is used to create new records in the menu encoded in the URL. The body should be set as a JSON object containing parameters applied to the
newly created record.
In case of success, the server returns the created object with all its parameters.
Only one resource can be created in a single request.
For example, add an IP address to a dummy interface:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X PUT https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address \
--data '{"address": "192.168.111.111", "interface": "dummy"}' -H "content-type: application/json"
{".id":"*A","actual-interface":"dummy","address":"192.168.111.111/32","disabled":"false",
"dynamic":"false","interface":"dummy","invalid":"false","network":"192.168.111.111"}
```
DELETE
This method is used to delete the record with a specified ID from the menu encoded in the URL. If the deletion has been succeeded, the server responds
with an empty response. For example, call to delete the record twice, on second call router will return 404 error:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X DELETE https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/*9
$ curl -k -u admin: -X DELETE https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/*9
{"error":404,"message":"Not Found"}
```
POST
All the API features are available through the POST method. The command word is encoded in the header and optional parameters are passed in the
JSON object with the corresponding fields and values. For example, to change the password of the active user, send
```
POST https://router/rest/password
{"old-password":"old","new-password":"N3w", "confirm-new-password":"N3w"}
```
REST response is structured similar to API response:
```
If the response contains '!re' sentences (records), the JSON reply will contain a list of objects.
If the '!done' sentence contains data, the JSON reply will contain an object with the data.
If there are no records or data in the '!done' sentence, the response will hold an empty list.
```
There are two special keys: .proplist and .query, which are used with the print command word. Read more about APIs responses, prop lists, and
queries in the API documentation.
Proplist
The '.proplist' key is used to create .proplist attribute word. The values can be a single string with comma-separated values:
```
POST https://router/rest/interface/print
{".proplist":"name,type"}
```
or a list of strings:
```
POST https://router/rest/interface/print
{".proplist":["name","type"]}
```
For example, return address and interface properties from the ip/address list:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X POST https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/print\
--data '{"_proplist": ["address","interface"]}' -H "content-type: application/json"
[{"address":"192.168.99.2/24","interface":"dummy"},
{"address":"172.16.5.1/24","interface":"sfpplus1"},
{"address":"172.16.6.1/24","interface":"sfp2"},
{"address":"172.16.7.1/24","interface":"sfp3"},
{"address":"10.155.101.214/24","interface":"sfp12"},
{"address":"192.168.111.111/32","interface":"dummy"}]
```
Query
The '.query' key is used to create a query stack. The value is a list of query words. For example this POST request :
```
POST https://router/rest/interface/print
{".query":["type=ether","type=vlan","#|!"]}
```
is equivalent to this API sentence
```
/interface/print
?type=ether
?type=vlan
?#|!
```
For example, let's combine 'query' and 'proplist', to return '.id', 'address', and 'interface' properties for all dynamic records and records with the network
192.168.111.111
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X POST https://10.155.101.214/rest/ip/address/print \
--data '{".proplist": [".id","address","interface"], ".query": ["network=192.168.111.111","dynamic=true","
#|"]}'\
-H "content-type: application/json"
[{".id":"*8","address":"10.155.101.214/24","interface":"sfp12"},
{".id":"*A","address":"192.168.111.111/32","interface":"dummy"}]
```
Timeout
If the command runs indefinitely, it will timeout and the connection will be closed with an error. The current timeout interval is 60 seconds. To avoid timeout
errors, add a parameter that would sufficiently limit the command execution time.
For example, let's see what we get when the ping command exceeds the timeout and how to prevent this by adding a count parameter:
```
Timeout is not affected by the parameters passed to the commands. If the command is set to run for an hour, it will terminate early and return
an error message.
```
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X POST https://10.155.101.214/rest/ping \
--data '{"address":"10.155.101.1"}' \
-H "content-type: application/json"
{"detail":"Session closed","error":400,"message":"Bad Request"}
```
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X POST https://10.155.101.214/rest/ping \
--data '{"address":"10.155.101.1","count":"4"}' \
-H "content-type: application/json"
[{"avg-rtt":"453us","host":"10.155.101.1","max-rtt":"453us","min-rtt":"453us","packet-loss":"0","received":"1","
sent":"1","seq":"0","size":"56","time":"453us","ttl":"64"},
{"avg-rtt":"417us","host":"10.155.101.1","max-rtt":"453us","min-rtt":"382us","packet-loss":"0","received":"2","
sent":"2","seq":"1","size":"56","time":"382us","ttl":"64"},
{"avg-rtt":"495us","host":"10.155.101.1","max-rtt":"650us","min-rtt":"382us","packet-loss":"0","received":"3","

sent":"4","seq":"3","size":"56","time":"359us","ttl":"64"}]
```
Another example is a bandwidth test tool, which can be limited by providing run duration:
```
$ curl -k -u admin: -X POST 'https://10.155.101.214/rest/tool/bandwidth-test' \
--data '{"address":"10.155.101.1","duration":"2s"}' \
-H "content-type: application/json"
[{".section":"0","connection-count":"20","direction":"receive","lost-packets":"0",
"random-data":"false","rx-10-second-average":"0","rx-current":"0","rx-size":"1500",
"rx-total-average":"0",
"status":"connecting"},
{".section":"1","connection-count":"20","direction":"receive","duration":"1s",
"lost-packets":"0","random-data":"false","rx-10-second-average":"0","rx-current":"0",
"rx-size":"1500","rx-total-average":"0",
"status":"running"},
{".section":"2","connection-count":"20","direction":"receive","duration":"2s",
"lost-packets":"581175","random-data":"false","rx-10-second-average":"854372352",
"rx-current":"854372352","rx-size":"1500","rx-total-average":"854372352",
"status":"running"},
{".section":"3","connection-count":"20","direction":"receive","duration":"3s",

"rx-current":"929585664","rx-size":"1500","rx-total-average":"891979008",
"status":"done testing"}]
```
Errors
The success or failure of the API calls is indicated in the HTTP status code. In case of failure (status code 400 or larger), the body of the response contains
a JSON object with the error code, a description of the error, and optional error details. For example, trying to delete an interface will return
```
{"error":406,"message":"Not Acceptable","detail":"no such command or directory (remove)"}
```


# RoMON
```
Summary
Secrets
Peer discovery
Configuration Examples
Applications
Run RoMON in WinBox by using CLI
Connect to RoMON through WinBox GUI
```

## Summary
RoMON stands for "Router Management Overlay Network". RoMON works by establishing an independent MAC layer peer discovery and data forwarding
network. RoMON packets are encapsulated with EtherType 0x88bf and DST-MAC 01:80:c2:00:88:bf and its network operate independently of L2 or L3
forwarding configuration. When RoMON is enabled, any received RoMON packets will not be displayed by sniffer or torch tools.
Each router on the RoMON network is assigned its RoMON ID. RoMON ID can be selected from the port MAC address or specified by the user.
RoMON protocol does not provide encryption services. Encryption is provided at the "application" level, by e.g. using ssh or by using a secure WinBox.

## Secrets
RoMON protocol secrets are used for message authentication, integrity check and replay prevention by means of hashing message contents with MD5.
For each interface, if the interface-specific secret list is empty, a global secret list is used. When sending out, messages are hashed with the first secret in
list if list is not empty and first is not "empty secret" (empty string = ""), otherwise, messages are sent unhashed. When received, unhashed messages are
only accepted if a secret list is empty or contains "empty secret", hashed messages are accepted if they are hashed with any of the secrets in list.
This design allows for the incremental introduction and/or change of secrets in-network without RoMON service interruption and can happen over RoMON
itself, e.g.:
```
initially, all routers are without secrets;
 configure each router one by one with secrets="","mysecret" - this will make all routers still send unprotected frames, but they all will be ready to
accept frames protected with secret "mysecret";
 configure each router one by one with secrets="mysecret","" - this will make all routers use secret "mysecret", but also still accept unprotected
frames (from routers that have not yet been changed);
 configure each router with secrets="mysecret" - this will make all routers use secret "mysecret" and also only accept frames protected with
"mysecret";
```
Changing of secret in a network should be performed in a similar fashion where for some time both secrets are in use in network.

## Peer discovery
In order to discover all routers on RoMON network RoMON discover command must be used:
```
RoMON packets can be forwarded through network switches or bridges, unless there are specific restrictions on multicast traffic. When using a
MikroTik bridge with hardware offloading, these packets are treated like regular multicast packets and are flooded across the network.
```
```
Since RouterOS v7.17, if the RoMON service is enabled and the switch chip supports ACL rules, dynamic rules are automatically created to
redirect these packets to the CPU, where the RoMON service operates. However, if the switch does not support ACL rules and configuration
does not align, such as when CPU and RoMON untagged packets are not in the same VLAN, the RoMON service might not function as
expected.
```

```
Configuration Examples
In order for a device to participate in the RoMON network, the RoMON feature must be enabled and ports that participate in the RoMON network must be
specified.
```
/tool romon set enabled=yes secrets=testing
```
Ports that participate in the RoMON network are configured in the RoMON port menu. Port list is a list of entries that match either specific port or all ports
and specifies if matching port(s) is forbidden to participate in the RoMON network and in case port is allowed to participate in RoMON network entry also
specifies the port cost. Note that all specific port entries have higher priority than the wildcard entry with interface=all.
For example, the following list specifies that all ports participate in RoMON network with cost 100 and ether7 interface with cost 200:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/port/print
Flags: * - default
Columns: INTERFACE, FORBID, COST
# INTERF FO COS
0 * all no 100
1 ether7 no 200
```
By default one wildcard entry with forbid=no and cost=100 is created.
Applications
Multiple applications can be run over the RoMON network.
In order to test the reachability of specific router on RoMON network RoMON ping command can be used:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/ping id=6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B count=5
SEQ HOST TIME STATUS
0 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms

4 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms
sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=1ms
```
In order to establish a secure terminal connection to router on RoMON network RoMON SSH command can be used:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/romon/ssh 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B
```
Run RoMON in WinBox by using CLI
In order to establish the RoMON session directly by using the command line on a computer, you must specify RoMON agents and desired routers
addresses. RoMON agent must be saved on Managed routers list in WinBox in order to make a successful connection:
```
winbox.exe --romon 192.168.88.1 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B admin ""
```

## Overview
The Serial Console and Serial Terminal are tools, used to communicate with devices and other systems that are interconnected via the serial port. The
serial terminal may be used to monitor and configure many devices - including modems, network devices (including MikroTik routers), and any device that
can be connected to a serial (asynchronous) port.
The Serial Console feature is for configuring direct-access configuration facilities (monitor/keyboard and serial port) that are mostly used for initial or
recovery configuration. A special null-modem cable is needed to connect two hosts (like two PCs, or two routers; not modems). Note that a terminal
emulation program (e.g., HyperTerminal on Windows or minicom on Linux) is required to access the serial console from another computer. Default settings
of the router's serial port are 115200 bits/s (for x86 default is 9600 bits/s), 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
Several customers have described situations where the Serial Terminal (managing side) feature would be useful:
```
on a mountaintop, where a MikroTik wireless installation sits next to equipment (including switches and Cisco routers) that can not be managed in-
band (by telnet through an IP network)
monitoring weather-reporting equipment through a serial port
connection to a high-speed microwave modem that needed to be monitored and managed by a serial connection
```
With the serial-terminal feature of the MikroTik, up to 132 (and, maybe, even more) devices can be monitored and controlled.

## Serial Console Connections
Serial communications between devices are done with RS232, it is one of the oldest and most widely spread communication methods in the computer
world. It was used for communication with the modems or other peripheral devices DTE/DCE. In the modern world, the main use of serial communication
is DTE/DTE communication (Data Terminal Equipment) e.g. using a null-modem cable. There are several types of null modem cables and some of them
may not work with RouterBoards at all.

## Null Modem Without Handshake
This cable does not utilize handshake pins at all:
```
Side1 (DB9f) Side2 (DB9f) Function
```
```
2 3 Rx ← Tx
```
```
3 2 Tx → Rx
```
```
5 5 GND
```
It allows data-only traffic on the cross-connected Rx/Tx lines. Hardware flow control is not possible with this type of cable. The only way to perform flow
control is with software flow control using the XOFF and XON characters.

## Null Modem With Loopback Handshake
The problem with the first cable is when connected to a device on which hardware flow control is enabled software may hang when checking modem
signal lines.
Null modem cable with loop back handshake fixes the problem, its main purpose is to fool well-defined software into thinking there is handshaking
available:
```
Side1 (DB9f) Side2 (DB9f) Function
```
```
2 3 Rx ← Tx
```
```
3 2 Tx → Rx
```
```
5 5 GND
```
```
1+4+6 - DTR → CD + DSR
```
- 1+4+6 DTR → CD + DSR
```
7+8 - RTS → CTS
```
- 7+8 RTS → CTS
Hardware flow control is not possible with this cable. Also if remote software does not send its own ready signal to DTR output communication will hang.
Null Modem With Partial Handshake
This cable can be used when flow control enabled without being incompatible with the original way flow control was used with DTE/DCE communication.
This type of cable is not recommended for use with RouterOS.
```
Side1 (DB9f) Side2 (DB9f) Function

```
5 5 GND
```
```
6 4 DSR ← DTR
```
```
7+8 1 RTS1 → CTS1 + CD2
```
Null Modem With Full Handshake
Used with special software and should not be used with RouterOS.

RB M33G Additional Serial Header
For RBM33G additional serial header can be attached on GPIO pins U3_RXD, GND, U3_TXD, and 3V3
CCR Serial Header
The Cloud Core Router series devices have a serial header on the PCB board, called J402 or 100
Here is the pin-out of that connector:
Serial Terminal Usage
RouterOS allows to communicate with devices and other systems that are connected to the router via the serial port using a /system serial-
terminal  command. All keyboard input will be forwarded to the serial port and all data from the port is output to the connected device.
First, you have to have a free serial port, if the device has only one serial port (like all RouterBoards, WRAP/ALIX boards, etc.) you will have to disable the
system console on this serial port to be able to use it as Serial Terminal for connection to other equipment (switches, modems, etc):
```
/system console disable 0
```
Be sure to just disable the console rather than removing it, as RouterOS will recreate the console after the next reboot when you really remove it.
Next, you will have to configure your serial port according to the serial port settings of the connected device. Using the following command you will set your
serial port to 19200 Baud 8N1. What settings you need to use depends on the device you connect:
```
/port set serial0 baud-rate=19200 data-bits=8 parity=none stop-bits=1
```
You can also try to let RouterOS guess the needed baud rate by setting
```
/port set serial0 baud-rate=auto
```
Now's the time to connect your device if not already done. Usually, you will have to use a null modem cable (the same thing as a cross-over-cable for
Ethernet). Now we're ready to go:
```
/system serial-terminal serial0
```
This will give you access to the device you connected to port Serial0. Ctrl-A is the prefix key, which means that you will enter a small "menu". If you need to
send the Ctrl-A character to a remote device, press Ctrl-A twice.
If you want to exit the connection to the serial device type Ctrl-A, then Q. This will return you to your RouterOS console.
Special Login
Special login can be used to access another device (like a switch, for example) that is connected through a serial cable by opening a telnet/ssh session
that will get you directly on this device (without having to login to RouterOS first).
For demonstration we will use two RouterBoards and one PC.
```
Note that there are some caveats you should be aware of! Take your time understanding those limits to avoid strange things to happen when
connecting a device to a serial port on a RouterBoard:
```
```
By re-configuring port Serial0 on a RouterBoard as seen above, you will lose your serial console access to RouterOS. This means, that
if you cannot access your RouterBoard over the network anymore, you might even have to reset the whole configuration of it to gain
access again.
When rebooting a RouterBoard the boot loader (RouterBOOT) will always use the serial console (Serial0 on RouterBoards) to send out
some startup messages and offer access to the RouterBOOT menu.
```
```
Having text coming out of the serial port to the connected device might confuse your attached device. Furthermore, in the standard
config, you can enter the RouterBOOT menu by pressing ANY key. So if your serial device sends any character to the serial port of
your RouterBoard during boot time, the RouterBoard will enter the RouterBOOT menu and will NOT boot RouterOS unless you
manually intervene!
```
```
You can reconfigure RouterBOOT to enter the RouterBOOT menu only when a DEL character is received - use this to reduce the
chance to get a router that's stuck when rebooting!
```
```
Or if newer versions are used "Silent boot" feature can be used to suppress any output on the serial interface, including removal of
booting sounds.
```
```
Do not connect to devices at an incorrect speed and avoid dumping binary data.
```
Routers R1 and R2 are connected with serial cable and PC is connected to R1 via ethernet. Lets say we want to access router R2 via serial cable from our
PC. To do this you have to set up serial interface proxy on R1. It can be done by feature called special-login.
First task is to unbind console from serial simply by disabling entry in /system console menu:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /system console> print
Flags: X - disabled, U - used, F - free
# PORT TERM
0 X serial0 vt102
```
Next step is to add new user, in this case serial, and bind it to the serial port
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user add name=serial group=full
[admin@MikroTik] > /special-login add user=serial port=serial0 disabled=no
[admin@MikroTik] > /special-login print
Flags: X - disabled
# USER PORT
0 serial serial0
```
Now we are ready to access R2 from our PC.
```
maris@bumba:/$ ssh serial@10.1.101.146
```
```
[Ctrl-A is the prefix key]
R2 4.0beta4
R2 Login:
```
```
[admin@R2] >
```
To exit special login mode press Ctrl+A and Q
```
[admin@MikroTik] >
[Q - quit connection] [B - send break]
[A - send Ctrl-A prefix] [R - autoconfigure rate]
```
```
Connection to 10.1.101.146 closed.
```
To fix this problem you need to allow access bootloader main menu from <any> key to <delete>:
```
By default console is bound to serial port.
```
```
After router reboot and serial cable attached router may stuck at Bootloader main menu
```
```
enter bootloader menu
press 'k' for boot key options
press '2' to change key to <delete>
```
What do you want to configure?
d - boot delay
k - boot key
s - serial console
n - silent boot
o - boot device
u - cpu mode
f - cpu frequency
r - reset booter configuration
e - format nand
g - upgrade firmware
i - board info
p - boot protocol
b - booter options
t - call debug code
l - erase license
x - exit setup
your choice: k - boot key
Select key which will enter setup on boot:
* 1 - any key
2 - <Delete> key only
your choice: 2

## SSH Server
RouterOS has built in SSH (SSH v2) server that is enabled by default and is listening for incoming connections on port TCP/22. It is possible to change the
port and disable the server under Services menu.

## Properties
Sub-menu: /ip ssh
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-none-crypto (yes|no; Default: no) Whether to allow connection if cryptographic algorithms are set to none.
```
```
always-allow-password-login (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to allow password login at the same time when public key authorization is configured for a
user.
```
```
forwarding-enabled (both | local | no | remote;
Default: no)
```
```
Allows to control which SSH forwarding method to allow:
```
```
no - SSH forwarding is disabled;
local - Allow SSH clients to originate connections from the server(router), this setting controls
also dynamic forwarding;
remote - Allow SSH clients to listen on the server(router) and forward incoming connections;
both - Allow both local and remote forwarding methods.
```
```
host-key-size (1024 | 1536 | 2048 | 4096 | 8192;
Default: 2048 )
```
```
RSA key size when host key is being regenerated.
```
```
host-key-type (ed25519 | rsa; Default: rsa) Select host key type
```
```
strong-crypto (yes | no; Default: no) Use stronger encryption, HMAC algorithms, use bigger DH primes and disallow weaker ones:
```
```
use 256 and 192 bit encryption instead of 128 bits;
disable null encryption;
use sha256 for hashing instead of sha1;
disable md5;
use 2048bit prime for Diffie-Hellman exchange instead of 1024bit.
```
Commands
```
Property Description
```
```
export-host-key (key-file-
prefix)
```
```
Export public and private RSA/Ed25519 to files. Command takes two parameters:
```
```
key-file-prefix - used prefix for generated files, for example, prefix 'my' will generate files 'my_rsa', 'my_rsa.pub' etc.
passphrase - private key passphrase
```
```
import-host-key (private-
key-file)
```
```
Import and replace private RSA/Ed25519 key from specified file. Command takes two parameters:
```
```
private-key-file - name of the private RSA/Ed25519 key file
passphrase - private key passphrase
```
```
regenerate-host-key () Generated new and replace current set of private keys (RSA/Ed25519) on the router. Be aware that previously imported
keys might stop working.
```
Enabling PKI authentication
Example of importing public key for user admin
Generate SSH keys on the client device (the device you will connect from). Upload the public SSH key to the router and import it.
```
/user ssh-keys import public-key-file=id_rsa.pub user=admin
```
SSH Client
Sub-menu: /system ssh
Simple log-in to remote host
It is able to connect to remote host and initiate ssh session. IP address supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
```
/system ssh 192.168.88.1
/system ssh 2001:db8:add:1337::beef
```
In this case user name provided to remote host is one that has logged into the router. If other value is required, then user=<username> has to be used.
```
/system ssh 192.168.88.1 user=lala
/system ssh 2001:db8:add:1337::beef user=lala
```
Log-in from certain IP address of the router
For testing or security reasons it may be required to log in to other host using certain source address of the connection. In this case src-address=<ip
address> argument has to be used. Note that IP address in this case supports both, IPv4 and IPv6.
```
/system ssh 192.168.88.1 src-address=192.168.89.2
/system ssh 2001:db8:add:1337::beef src-address=2001:db8:bad:1000::2
```
```
Host keys are exported in PKCS#8 format.
```
```
Private key is supported in PEM or PKCS#8 format.
```
```
Exporting the SSH host key requires "sensitive" user policy.
```
in this case, ssh client will try to bind to address specified and then initiate ssh connection to remote host.
Log-in using RSA public/private key
Example of importing private key for user admin
First, export currently generated SSH keys to a file:
```
/ip ssh export-host-key key-file-prefix=admin
```
Two files admin_rsa and admin_rsa.pub will be generated. The pub file needs to be trusted on the SSH server side (how to enable SSH PKI on RouterOS)
The private key has to be added for the particular user.
```
/user ssh-keys private import user=admin private-key-file=admin_rsa
```
After the public key is installed and trusted on the SSH server, a PKI SSH session can be created.
```
/system ssh 192.168.1.1
```
Watch how to:
Log in wih an RSA key.
Log in with ed25519.
Executing remote commands
To execute remote command it has to be supplied at the end of log-in line
```
/system ssh 192.168.88.1 "/ip address print"
/system ssh 192.168.88.1 command="/ip address print"
/system ssh 2001:db8:add:1337::beef "/ip address print"
/system ssh 2001:db8:add:1337::beef command="/ip address print"
```
For example, sending command "/ip address \n add address=1.1.1.1/24" to MikroTik router will fail.
SSH exec
Sub-menu: /system ssh-exec
Command ssh-exec is a non-interactive ssh command, thus allowing to execute commands remotely on a device via scripts and scheduler.
Retrieve information
The command will return two values:
```
Only user with full rights on the router can change 'user' attribute value under /user ssh-keys private
```
```
If the server does not support pseudo-tty (ssh -T or ssh host command), like MikroTik ssh server, then it is not possible to send multiline
commands via SSH
```
```
If you wish to execute remote commands via scripts or scheduler, use command ssh-exec.
```
```
exit-code: returns 0 if the command execution succeeded
output: returns the output of remotely executed command
```
Example: Code below will retrieve interface status of ether1 from device 10.10.10.1 and output the result to "Log"
```
:local Status ([/system ssh-exec address=10.10.10.1 user=remote command=":put ([/interface ethernet monitor
[find where name=ether1] once as-value]->\"status\")" as-value]->"output")
:log info $Status
```
Watch how to execute commands through SSH.
```
For security reasons you should not use plain text password with parameter "password" specified in the command line. To ensure safe
execution of the command remotely, it is strongly recommended to use SSH PKI authentication for users on both sides.
```
```
The user group and script policy executing the command requires test permission

TR069-client implements CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) for remote device management, which is standardized by the Broadband Forum
(BBF). CWMP works over IP network using HTTP(S) to communicate with an Auto Configuration Server (ACS), which can monitor, configure attributes and
update the firmware of a remote device. Typically used by ISPs to manage CPEs, but also can be used for Network Infrastructure Device management.
Requires tr069-client package.

```
CWMP Session
CWMP client usually starts communication(Session) with ACS on different events - first boot, reboot, periodic interval, remote request, value change etc. In
each session, CPE and ACS can call RPCs to be "executed" on the other side. CPE always starts with Inform RPC, which contains connection reason,
device info and some Parameter values depending on configuration. When CPE has nothing more to say, then ACS executes its RPCs (which most of the
time are Parameter management RPCs).
Parameters and Data Models
Parameters are simple name+value pairs and each vendor can decide which Parameters to support in its devices. A combination of all supported
Parameters is called Data Model (DM). BBF defines three root Data Models(TR-098, TR-181:1, TR-181:2) on which vendors should base their supported
Parameters. RouterOS Data Model is based on "TR-181 Issue 2 Amendment 11", which is the newest DM and recommended by BBF.

```
Download RPC
RouterOS Update (1 Firmware Upgrade Image)
CWMP standard defines that CPE's firmware can be updated using Download RPC with FileType="1 Firmware Upgrade Image" and single URL of a
downloadable file (HTTP and HTTPS are supported). Standard also states that downloaded file can be any type and vendor specific process can be
applied to finish firmware update. Because MikroTik's update is package based (and also for extra flexibility), an XML file is used to describe firmware
upgrade/downgrade. For now, XML configuration supports providing multiple URLs of files, which will be downloaded and applied similarly as regular
RouterOS update through firmware/package file upload.
An example of RouterOS bundle package and tr069-client package update (don't forget to also update tr069-client package). An XML file should be put on
some HTTP server, which is accessible from CPE for download. Also, downloadable RouterOS package files should be accessible the same way (can be
on any HTTP server). Using ACS execute Download RPC with URL pointing to XML file (e.g. "https://example.com/path/upgrade.xml") with contents:
<upgrade version="1" type="links">
<config/>
<links>
<link>
<url>https://example.com/routeros-mipsbe-X.Y.Z.npk</url>
</link>
<link>
<url>https://example.com/tr069-client-X.Y.Z-mipsbe.npk</url>
</link>
</links>
</upgrade>
CPE will download XML, parse/validate its contents, download files from provided URLs and try to upgrade. The result will be reported with
TransferComplete RPC.
Configuration Change (3 Vendor Configuration File)
The same Download RPC can be used to perform complete configuration overwrite (as intended by standard) OR configuration alteration (when URL's
filename extension is ".alter").
Alter configuration
RouterOS has a lot of configuration attributes and not everything can be ported to CWMP Parameters, that's why RouterOS provides a possibility to
execute its powerful scripting language to configure any attribute. A configuration alteration (which is really a regular script execution) can be performed
using Download RPC FileType="3 Vendor Configuration File" with downloadable file extension ".alter". This powerful feature can be used to configure any
ROS attributes which are not available through CWMP Parameters.
Overwrite all configurations
Full ROS configuration overwrite can be performed using Download RPC FileType="3 Vendor Configuration File" with any URL file name (except with ".
alter" extension).
Warning: Provided configuration file(script) must be "smart" enough to apply configuration correctly right after reboot. This is especially important when
using uploaded configuration file with Upload RPC, because it only contains values export. Some things that should be added manually:
```
delay at beginning, for interfaces to show up;
hidden passwords for users;
certificates.
```
RouterOS default configuration change (X MIKROTIK Factory Configuration File)
This vendor specific FileType allows the change of the RouterOS default configuration script that is executed when /system reset-configuration command
is executed (or the other means when router configuration is being reset).
FactoryReset RPC
This is CWMP standard RPC, which performs RouterOS configuration factory-reset. The reset process is performed in the same way as executing the
command:
/system reset-configuration skip-backup=yes
```
Note
```
```
Always make firmware updates incremental - first, update locally tested device and make sure that CWMP communication is resumed with a
new version and required ROS functionality works. Secondly, repeat steps by updating groups of CPEs incrementally. We do not recommend
updating all remote devices at once.
```
```
Warning: Use HTTPS in production for firmware management
```
```
Note
```
```
If the default configuration script is changed it will not be displayed by /system default-configuration print as it is the case if that script is altered
via Netinstall tool. That command will always show the default script set up by MikroTik
```
```
Warning: Use this with caution as the failure of uploaded script may render device inoperable and/or inaccessible by the ACS
```
Note that the default factory configuration can be different for each device (see [1]) and execution of this command removes all configurations and
executes internally stored default-configuration script.
Best Practices Guide for preparing CPE with custom factory settings for TR069 https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Tr069-best-practices
Upload RPC
Upload current configuration (1 Vendor Configuration File)
The result of this is file uploaded to the ACS same as the output of /export command in the RouterOS
Upload log file (2 Vendor Log File)
The result of this is file uploaded to the ACS is similar to the output of /log print command in the RouterOS
Upload default configuration (X MIKROTIK Factory Configuration File)
The result of this is file uploaded to the ACS that has contents of the current set default configuration script that will be executed if /system reset-
configuration command is executed. It may differ from one returned using /system default-configuration print.
Security
```
HTTP should only be used when testing initial setup in the secured/private network because Man-in-the-middle attacker could read/change
configuration parameters. In the production environment, HTTPS is a MUST.
CWMP's incoming connection validation by design is safe because CPE will not communicate with any other device except previously configured
ACS. Connection Request only signals CPE to start a new connection + new session with previously configured ACS.

## Introduction
WebFig is a web-based RouterOS utility that allows you to monitor, configure and troubleshoot the router. It is designed as an alternative of WinBox, both
have similar layouts and both have access to almost any feature of RouterOS.
As Webfig is platform-independent, it can be used to configure a router directly from various devices without the need for software developed for specific
platforms. In other words, there is no need to install additional software.
WebFig allows performing three basic actions:
```
Configuration - view and edit current configuration;
Monitoring - display the current status of the router, routing information, interface stats, logs, etc.;
Troubleshooting - RouterOS has built-in many troubleshooting tools (like ping, traceroute, packet sniffers, traffic generators, etc.) and all of them
can be used with WebFig
```

## Connecting to a Router
As we already know from the First Time Configuration section, the device by default has username admin and no password configured. Simply open a
Web browser and in the search bar type device IP address which by default is 192.168.88.1. Be sure your device has IP address from the same network,
for example, 192.168.88.2 otherwise Layer3 communication will not work.
Enable HTTPS
For HTTPS to work properly, you need to specify a valid certificate that WebFig can use. You can use a certificate that is issued by a trusted Certificate
Authority (CA) or you can create your own root CA and generate self-signed certificates.
To generate your own certificates and enable HTTPS access, you must configure the following:
Create your own root CA on your router and sign it
```
[admin@MikroTik] > certificate add name=local-cert common-name=local-cert key-usage=key-cert-sign,crl-sign
[admin@MikroTik] > certificate sign local-cert
progress: done
```
Create a new certificate for WebFig (non-root certificate)
```
WebFig supports wildcard certificates. You can generate such a certificate by specifying a wildcard in the common-name property, for example,
common-name=*.mikrotik.com.
```
```
In case you already have set up your own CA or you are using a service that signs certificates for you, then you need to create and sign the
certificate remotely and import the certificate on the router later. In case you are importing a certificate, then make sure you mark the certificate
as trusted.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > certificate add name=webfig common-name=192.168.88.1
[admin@MikroTik] > certificate sign webfig
progress: done
[admin@MikroTik] > certificate print
Flags: K - private-key; A - authority; T - trusted
Columns:NAME COMMON-NAME FINGERPRINT
0 KAT local-cert local-cert 9b6363d033c4b2e6893c340675cfb8d1e330977526dba347a440fabffd983c5d
1 KAT webfig 192.168.88.1 9f84ac2979bea65dccd02652056e5559bcdf866f8da5f924139d99453402bd02
```
Enable www-ssl and specify to use the newly created certificate for WebFig
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip service
set www-ssl certificate=webfig disabled=no
```
You can now visit https://192.168.88.1 and securely configure your router.
The "Terminal"
The "Terminal" or Command Line Interface (CLI) in WebFig is located in the top right corner. It offers the same functionality as the "New Terminal" in the
WinBox GUI.
Skins
```
By default, browsers will not trust self-signed certificates, you will need to add the certificate as trusted on the first time you visit the page in your
browser. Another approach is to export the root CA certificate and import it as a trusted root certificate on your computer, this way all certificates
signed by this router will be considered as valid and will make it easier to manage certificates in your network.
```
```
Most Internet browsers have their own certificate trust chain and work independently of the operating system's certificate trust chain, this means
that you may have to add your own root CA's certificate as a trusted certificate in your browser settings since trusting the certificate in your
operating system's settings might not have any effect when using your Internet browser.
```
WebFig Design Skin is a handy tool to make the interface more user-friendly. It is not a security tool. If the user has sufficient rights it is possible to access
hidden features by other means.
Designing skins
If the user has sufficient permissions (the group has the policy "policy" and "sensitive" to edit permissions) Design Skin button becomes available. Pressing
that toggle button will open interface editing options.
To prevent the user from accessing the Design Skin menu, disable policy "policy" and "sensitive" under the user group configuration.
Possible operations are:
```
Hide menu - this will hide all items from the menu and its submenus;
Hide submenu - only certain submenu will be hidden;
Hide tabs - if submenu details have several tabs, it is possible to hide them this way;
Rename menus and items - make certain features more obvious or translate them into your language;
Add a note to the item (in detail view) - to add comments on the field;
Make item read-only (in detail view) - for user safety very sensitive fields can be made read only;
Hide flags (in detail view) - while it is only possible to hide a flag in detail view, this flag will not be visible in list view and in detailed view;
Add limits for the field - (in detail view) where it is the list of times that are comma or newline separated list of allowed values:
number interval '..' example: 1..10 will allow values from 1 to 10 for fields with numbers, for example, MTU size.
field prefix (Text fields, MAC address, set fields, combo-boxes). If it is required to limit prefix length $ should be added to the end. For
example, limiting the wireless interface to "station" only, "Add limit" will contain "station$"
```
```
Add Tab - will add a gray ribbon with an editable label that will separate the fields. Ribbon will be added before the field it is added to;
Add Separator - will add a low height horizontal separator before the field it is added to.
```
Skin design examples
If you need to limit the user for some services
```
Note: Number interval cannot be set to extend limitations set by RouterOS for that field
```
```
Note: Set fields are arguments that consist of a set of check-boxes, for example, setting up policies for user groups, RADIUS "Service"
```
```
Note: Limitations set for combo-boxes will also limit the values selectable from the dropdown
```
Add a limit to the RADIUS Service.
The result will be only those services, that are pointed in the "Limit" field.
Using skins
To use skins you have to assign the skin to the group. When that is done, users of that group will automatically use the selected skin as their default when
logging into WebFig or WinBox.
```
/user/group/set your_group_name skin=your_skin
```
If it is required to use created skin on another router you can copy files to the skins folder on the other router. On the new router, it is required to add
copied skin to the user group to use it.

## Summary
WinBox is a small utility that allows the administration of MikroTik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI. It is a native Win32/Win64 binary but can be run
on Linux and macOS (OSX) using Wine. All WinBox interface functions are as close as possible mirroring the console functions, that is why there are no
WinBox sections in the manual. Some advanced and system critical configurations are not possible from the WinBox, like MAC address change on an
interface.
From WinBox v3.14, the following security features are used:
```
WinBox.exe is signed with an Extended Validation certificate, issued by SIA Mikrotīkls (MikroTik).
WinBox uses ECSRP for key exchange and authentication (requires a new WinBox version).
Both sides verify that the other side knows the password (no man in the middle attack is possible).
WinBox in RoMON mode requires that the agent is the latest version to be able to connect to the latest version routers.
WinBox uses AES128-CBC-SHA as an encryption algorithm (requires WinBox version 3.14 or above).
```

## Starting WinBox
WinBox loader can be downloaded from the MikroTik download page. When WinBox.exe is downloaded, double click on it, and the WinBox loader window
will pop up. There are two WinBox loader modes: simple which is enabled by default and advanced.

## Simple mode
When you open WinBox loader for the first time simple mode layout will be used:
```
A native WinBox beta version for Linux and macOS is now available on the MikroTik downloads page!
```
To connect to the router enter the IP or MAC address of the router, specify username and password (if any) and click on the Connect button. You can also
enter the port number after the IP address, separating them with a colon, like this 192.168.88.1:9999. The port can be changed in the RouterOS services
menu.
You can also use neighbor discovery, to list available routers use the Neighbors tab:
From the list of discovered routers, you can click on the IP or MAC address column to connect to that router. If you click on IP address then IP will be used
to connect, but if you click on MAC Address then the MAC address will be used to connect to the router.
```
It is recommended to use an IP address whenever possible. MAC session uses network broadcasts and is not 100% reliable.
```
```
Neighbor discovery will show also devices that are not compatible with WinBox, like Cisco routers or any other device that uses CDP (Cisco
Discovery Protocol). If you will try to connect to a SwOS device, then the connection will be established through a web browser
```

```
Fields:
```
Session - Saved router session.
Note - Note that is assigned to save router entry.
Group - Group to which saved router entry is assigned.
RoMON Agent - Select RoMON Agent from the available device list
```
Command Line
It is possible to use the command line to pass connect to, user and password parameters automatically:
winbox.exe [<connect-to> [<login> [<password>]]]
For example (with no password):
winbox.exe 10.5.101.1 admin ""
Will connect to router 10.5.101.1 with user "admin" without a password.
It is possible to use the command line to pass connect to, user, and password parameters automatically to connect to the router through RoMON. In this
case, RoMON Agent must be saved on the Managed routers list so WinBox would know the user and password for this device:
winbox.exe --romon [<romon-agent> [<connect-to> [<login> [<password>]]]]
For example (with no password):
winbox.exe --romon 10.5.101.1 D4:CA:6D:E1:B5:7D admin ""
Will connect to router D4:CA:6D:E1:B5:7D, through 10.5.101.1 via RoMON Agent with user "admin" without a password.
IPv6 connectivity
WinBox supports IPv6 connectivity. To connect to the router's IPv6 address, it must be placed in square braces the same as in web browsers when
connecting to the IPv6 server. Example:
[db8::1]
when connecting to the link-local address interface index must be entered after the %:
[0:a00:27ff:fe70::e88c%2]
Port number is set after the square brace when it is necessary to connect WinBox to other port than the default:
[0:a00:27ff:fe70::e88c]:8299
WinBox neighbor discovery is capable of discovering IPv6 enabled routers. There are two entries for each IPv6 enabled router, one entry is with IPv4
address and another one with IPv6 link-local address. You can easily choose which one you want to connect to.
Run WinBox on macOS
Starting with macOS 10.15 Catalina, Apple has removed support for 32bit applications, meaning it is no longer possible to use regular Wine and regular
WinBox in this OS. Wine has made available a 64bit version for macOS, and MikroTik has released a special WinBox64.exe version as well.
To run WinBox64 the following steps are required.
```
Managed routers list is encrypted, but it can still be loaded with another WinBox, IF the master password is not set for it!
```

### 1.

### 2.
```
Install latest Wine from the Wine macOS builds page ( wine-devel-7.X-osx64.tar.xz) and make sure you have downloaded the WinBox64.exe
executable from the MikroTik download page.
Launch WinBox64.exe with "open file with" > Wine64.app
```
Run WinBox on Linux
It is possible to run WinBox on Linux by using Wine emulation software. Make sure that the Microsoft font pack is installed, otherwise, you may see
distortions.
Interface Overview
WinBox interface has been designed to be intuitive for most of the users. The interface consists of:
```
The main toolbar at the top where users can add various info fields, like CPU and memory usage.
The menu bar on the left - list of all available menus and sub-menus. This list changes depending on what packages are installed. For example, if
the IPv6 package is disabled, then the IPv6 menu and all its sub-menus will not be displayed.
Work area - an area where all menu windows are opened.
```
The title bar shows information to identify with which router WinBox session is opened. Information is displayed in the following format:
[username]@[Router's IP or MAC] ( [RouterID] ) - WinBox [ROS version] on [RB model] ([platform])
From screenshot above we can see that user krisjanis is logged into router with IPv4/IPv6 address [fe80::4e5e:cff:fef6:c0ab%3]. Router's ID is 3C18-
Krisjanis_GW, currently installed RouterOS version is v6.36rc6, RouterBoard is CCR1036-12G-4S and platform is tile.
On the Main toolbar's left side is located:
```
undo
redo
```
```
Safe Mode
 Currently loaded session
```
More about Safe mode and undoing performed actions read in this article.
On the right side is located:
```
an indicator that shows whether the WinBox session uses encryption
WinBox traffic indicator displayed as a green bar,
Custom info fields that can be added by the user by right-clicking on the toolbar and picking available info fields from the list
```
Work Area and Child Windows
WinBox has an MDI interface meaning that all menu configuration (child) widows are attached to the main (parent) WinBox window and is showed in the
work area.
Child windows can not be dragged out of the working area. Notice in the screenshot above that the Interface window is dragged out of the visible working
area and a horizontal scroll bar appeared at the bottom. If any window is outside visible work area boundaries the vertical or/and horizontal scrollbars will
appear.
Child window menu bar
Each child window has its own toolbar. Most of the windows have the same set of toolbar buttons:
```
Add - add a new item to the list
```
```
Remove - remove the selected item from the list
```
```
Enable - enable selected item (the same as enable command from console)
```
```
Disable - disable selected item (the same as disable command from console)
```
```
Comment - add or edit a comment
```
```
Sort - allows to sort out items depending on various parameters. Read more >>
```
Almost all windows have a quick search input field on the right side of the toolbar. Any text entered in this field is searched through all the items and
highlighted as illustrated in the screenshot below
Notice that on the right side next to the quick find input filed there is a drop-down box. For the currently opened (IP Route) window, this drop-down box
allows to quickly sort out items by routing tables. For example, if the main is selected, then only routes from the main routing table will be listed.
A similar drop-down box is also in all firewall windows to quickly sort out rules by chains.
Sorting out displayed items
Almost every window has a Sort button. When clicking on this button several options appear as illustrated in the screenshot below

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.

### 5.

### 6.
The example shows how to quickly filter out routes that are in the 10.0.0.0/8 range
```
Press Sort button
Choose Dst.Address from the first drop-down box.
Choose in form the second drop-down box. "in" means that filter will check if DST address value is in range of the specified network.
Enter the network against which values will be compared (in our example enter "10.0.0.0/8")
These buttons are to add or remove another filter to the stack.
Press the Filter button to apply our filter.
```
As you can see from the screenshot WinBox sorted out only routes that are within the 10.0.0.0/8 range.
Comparison operators (Number 3 in the screenshot) may be different for each window. For example "IP Route" window has only two is and in. Other
windows may have operators such as "is not", "contains", "contains not".
WinBox allows building a stack of filters. For example, if there is a need to filter by destination address and gateway, then
```
set the first filter as described in the example above,
press [+] button to add another filter bar in the stack.
set up a second filter to filter by the gateway
press the Filter button to apply filters.
```
You can also remove unnecessary filters from the stack by pressing the [-] button.
Customizing list of displayed columns
By default, WinBox shows the most commonly used parameters. However sometimes it is needed to see other parameters, for example, "BGP AS Path" or
other BGP attributes to monitor if routes are selected properly.
WinBox allows to customize displayed columns for each individual window. For example to add BGP AS path column:
```
Click on the little arrow button ( 1 ) on the right side of the column titles or right mouse click on the route list.
From popped up menu move to Show Columns ( 2 ) and from the sub-menu pick the desired column, in our case click on BGP AS Path ( 3 )
```
Changes made to window layout are saved and next time when WinBox is opened the same column order and size are applied.
Detail mode
It is also possible to enable Detail mode. In this mode all parameters are displayed in columns, the first column is the parameter name, the second column
is the parameter's value.
To enable detail mode right mouse click on the item list and from the popup menu pick Detail mode
Category view
It is possible to list items by categories. In this mode, all items will be grouped alphabetically or by another category. For example, items may be
categorized alphabetically if sorted by name, items can also be categorized by type like in the screenshot below.
To enable Category view, right mouse click on the item list and from the popup menu pick Show Categories
Drag & Drop
It is possible to upload and download files to/from the router using WinBox drag & drop functionality. You can also download the file by pressing the right
mouse button on it and selecting "Download".
Traffic monitoring
WinBox can be used as a tool to monitor the traffic of every interface, queue, or firewall rule in real-time. The screenshot below shows Ethernet traffic
monitoring graphs.
```
Drag & Drop works if WinBox is running on Linux using wine4. Drag and drop between two WinBox windows may fail.
```
Item copy
This shows how easy it is to copy an item in WinBox. In this example, we will use the COPY button to make a Dynamic PPPoE server interface into a
Static interface.
This image shows us the initial state, as you see DR indicates "D" which means Dynamic:
Double-Click on the interface and click on COPY:
A new interface window will appear, a new name will be created automatically (in this case pppoe-in1)
After this Down/Up event this interface will be Static:
Transferring Settings
```
Managed router transfer - In the File menu, use Save As and Open functions to save the managed router list to file and open it up again on a new
workstation.
```
```
Router sessions transfer - In the Tools menu, use Export and Import functions to save existing sessions to file and import them again on a new
workstation.

Troubleshooting
WinBox cannot connect to the router's IP address, devices do not show up in the Neighbors list
Make sure that the Windows firewall is set to allow WinBox connections through Private and/or Public network interfaces in the Windows firewall, it can be
changed in Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall\Allowed applications or disable the Windows firewall.
I get an error '(port 20561) timed out' when connecting to routers mac address
Windows (7/8) does not allow mac connection if file and print sharing is disabled.
I can't find my device in WinBox IPv4 Neighbors list or MAC connection fails with "ERROR could not connect to XX-XX-XX-XX-
XX-XX"
Most of the network drivers will not enable IP stack unless your host device has an IP configuration. Set IPv4 configuration on your host device.
Sometimes the device will be discovered due to caching, but MAC connection will still fail with "ERROR: could not connect to XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```
WinBox MAC-ADDRESS connection requires MTU value set to 1500, unfragmented. Other values can perform poorly - loss of connectivity can
occur.

## Description
FlashFig is an application for mass router configuration. It can be used by MikroTik distributors, ISPs, or any other companies who need to apply RouterOS
configuration to many routers in the shortest possible time.
FlashFig applies MikroTik RouterOS configuration to any RouterBOARD within 3 seconds. You can perform FlashFig on a batch of routers, the only thing
you need is to connect RouterBOARD to a Layer 2 network running FlashFig and to power a FlashFig-enabled RouterBOARD up.
FlashFig only runs on a Windows computer and is available from the downloads page.
All RouterBOARDs support FlashFig mode. It works between a Windows computer running FlashFig and a RouterBOARD in the same broadcast domain
(direct Layer 2 Ethernet network connection is required).
FlashFig support is enabled on every new RouterBOARD manufactured since March 2010 by default from the factory. For older models, FlashFig can be
enabled via RouterBOOT or from MikroTik RouterOS console - /system routerboard settings set boot-device=flash-boot-once-then-nand or /system
routerboard settings set boot-device=flash-boot.
FlashFig mode on a brand new RouterBOARD is disabled on further boots only after the first successful user login or successful FlashFig attempt to avoid
unwanted reconfiguration at a later time. To use FlashFig a second time on the same router, you need to enable flash-boot in Bootloader settings (this
setting will revert to NAND after a successful configuration change OR once any user logs into the board).
If RouterOS reset-configuration command is used later (or configuration reset using the Reset button), FlashFig configuration is loaded. To permanently
overwrite, use the Netinstall process and check Apply default configuration or use -r flag in Linux-based command line.
You view FlashFig video tutorial on MikroTik YouTube channel.

## FlashFig Example
This is a step-by-step example of how to use the FlashFig process to apply a chosen MikroTik RouterOS configuration to a 'factory fresh' RouterBOARD.
Requirements
The Windows computer must be equipped with the following ports and contain the following files:
```
A working Ethernet port;
Valid .rsc file(s) with MikroTik RouterOS configuration similar to an export/import file. In addition to regular configuration commands, it is also
possible to re-apply the factory passwords by using the read-only variables $defconfPassword and $defconfWifiPassword (starting from
RouterOS 7.10beta8);
Always use the latest FlashFig program available from the downloads page;
The RouterBOARD has to be in flash-boot mode, if this is the very first boot, nothing needs to be done
```
```
Starting from RouterOS/RouterBOOT v7.16, flash boot mode will be enabled in the same way as from the factory, after every system reset
initiated from the software. The same mode will be initiated when you reset router with the reset button, (bootloader version  v7.16 or higher is
required).
Please note that if you press and hold reset button before powering on the router, then the backup booter is used. The backup booter firmware
(installed in the factory) must also then be v7.16 or higher.
```
Pre-Configuration
Windows Computer
```
Run FlashFig;
Prepare .rsc file, .rsc file is regular/import file, it accepts valid MikroTik RouterOS CLI commands. You can create .rsc file with any text editor
program (Notepad, Notepad++, Texteditor, TextEdit, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer)
```
```
Assign Boot Client Address, which should be an address within the same subnet as that configured on the computer's Ethernet interface,
```
```
Browse for .rsc MikroTik RouterOS configuration file to apply to the RouterBOARD, highlight the file and Select to approve it,
```
```
Be aware of the text editor's treatment of CR/LF characters and test that the config has no errors when normally applied onto an identical
version of RouterOS before applying via FlashFig as run-time errors will not be visible!
```
```
Activate FlashFig server, now it is ready to FlashFig. Note, any RouterBOARD will be FlashFig'ed within the network when they are powered on
with boot-device configured to flash-boot or flash-boot-once-then-nand,
```
RouterBOARD
```
FlashFig mode is enabled on every RouterBOARD from the factory by default, which means no configuration is required on RouterBOARD.
```
```
If FlashFig is not enabled on your router, access the RouterBOARD with WinBox/Console and change the boot-device to flash-boot or flash-boot-
once-then-nand:
```
```
system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot
```
Or use a more preferable option, for a single boot flash-boot:
```
system/routerboard/settings/set boot-device=flash-boot-once-then-nand
```
Your router is now ready for FlashFig.
Connect
Connect the Boot port of RouterBOARD and FlashFig computer to the same Local Area Network.
Run FlashFig
```
Plug-in power for RouterBOARD
```
```
Check the status on FlashFig program,
```
Messages log shows "FlashFigged" and RouterBOARD should repeatedly make the morse code sound for the character "/" ("_.._." and flash the LED - it is
now safe to unplug / power down the router.
```
FlashFig configuration was applied to the RouterBOARD and it is ready to be used in production with this new config.
```
Troubleshoot
FlashFig can not find a router
If between a PC and a router there is another device (a router/switch), ensure that for this device:
```
DHCP server is disabled;
if used ports are in a bridge, set bridge protocol-mode to none;
HW-offload for used ports is disabled.
```
FlashFig finds a router, flashing is not done (no TFTP request)
Ensure that the computer on which FlashFig is running has only one network interface active.
FlashFig is done, but a configuration is not applied
If all procedures went successfully, but RouterOS configuration from .rsc file is not applied, add startup delay to *.rsc configuration file. The reason might
be, that the configuration script is executed before all interfaces boots up.
Not enough flash space, ignoring
FlashFig configuration maximum file size is up to 4000 bytes, otherwise program will return an error as above.

type (pem | pkcs12 Default: pem) Exported certificate type.
```
```
In case of PEM, certificate will be exported with CRT extension, if export-passphrase is specified, also
encrypted private KEY file will be exported.
```
```
In case of PKCS12, certificate will be exported with P12 extension, if export-passphrase is specified,
exported certificate will contain encryted private key.
```
```
/certificate
export-certificate CA-Template
export-certificate ServerCA export-passphrase=yourpassphrase

Exported certificates are available under the /file section:
```
The time of the key signing process depends on the key size of a specific certificate. With values of 4k and higher, it might take a substantial
time to sign this specific certificate on less powerful CPU-based devices.

Let's Encrypt certificates
RouterOS v7 has Let's Encrypt (letsencrypt) certificate support for the 'www-ssl' service. To enable the Let's Encrypt certificate service with automatic
certificate renewal, use the 'enable-ssl-certificate' command:
```
/certificate enable-ssl-certificate dns-name=my.domain.com
```
Note that the DNS name must point to the router and port TCP/80 must be available from the WAN. If the dns-name is not specified, it will default to the
automatically generated /ip cloud name (ie. [http://example.sn.mynetname.net)](http://example.sn.mynetname.net))
Different acme servers
Support has been added starting from 7.15beta7, you can use not only Let's Encrypt certificate service, but any other you like.

SCEP
SCEP is using HTTP protocol and base64 encoded GET requests. Most of the requests are without authentication and cipher, however, important ones
can be protected if necessary (ciphered or signed using a received public key).
SCEP client in RouterOS will:
```
get CA certificate from CA server or RA (if used);
user should compare the fingerprint of the CA certificate or if it comes from the right server;
generate a self-signed certificate with a temporary key;
send a certificate request to the server;
if the server responds with status x, then the client keeps requesting until the server sends an error or approval.
```
The SCEP server supports the issuance of one certificate only. RouterOS supports also renew and next-ca options:
```
renew - the possibility to renew the old certificate automatically with the same CA.
next-ca - possibility to change the current CA certificate to the new one.
```
The client polls the server for any changes, if the server advertises that the next-ca is available, then the client may request the next CA or wait until CA
almost expires and then request the next-ca.
The RouterOS client by default will try to use POST, AES, and SHA256 if the server advertises that. If the above algorithms are not supported, then the
client will try to use 3DES, DES and SHA1, MD5.
SCEP certificates are renewed when 3/4 of their validity time has passed.

Examples
RouterOS Authenticator configuration
Port based VLAN ID assignment
Dynamic switch rule configuration
RouterOS Supplicant configuration
```

## Summary
```
Dot1X is implementation of IEEE 802.1X standard in RouterOS. Main purpose is to provide port-based network access control using EAP over LAN
also known as EAPOL. 802.1X consists of a supplicant (client), an authenticator (server) and an authentication server (RADIUS server). Both
authenticator and supplicant sides are supported in RouterOS, as well as authentication server when User Manager package is installed. Supported
EAP methods for supplicant are EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2.
```

```
Property Description
```
```
Feature is not supported on SMIPS devices (hAP lite, hAP lite TC and hAP mini).
```
```
status (authenticated | authenticating |
disabled)
```
```
Possible statuses:
```
```
authenticated - the client has successfully authenticated;
authenticated without server - access to the port is granted without communication with
server;
authenticating - the server is reached and authentication process is ongoing;
connecting - initial stage of the authentication process;
disabled - the client is disabled;
error - an internal error has occurred;
interface is down - the parent interface is not running;
rejected - the server denied the authentication.
```
Server
A RouterOS dot1x server acts as an authenticator. An interface where dot1x server is enabled will block all traffic except for EAPOL packets which is
used for the authentication. After client is successfully authenticated, the interface will accept all received traffic on the port. If the interface is
connected to a shared medium with multiple hosts, the traffic will be accepted from all hosts when at least one client is successfully authenticated.
However, it is possible to configure dynamic switch rules to accept only the authenticated user source MAC address and drop all other source MAC
addresses. In case of failed authentication, it is possible to accept the traffic with a dedicated port VLAN ID.
Sub-menu: /interface dot1x server
```
Property Description
```
```
accounting (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether to send RADIUS accounting requests to authentication server.
```
```
auth-timeout (time; Default: 1m) Total time available for EAP authentication.
```
```
auth-types (dot1x | mac-auth; Default:
dot1x)
```
```
Used authentication type on a server interface. When both options are selected at the same time, the
server will prefer dot1x authentication type and only after 3 retrans-timeout periods, the
authentication type will fall back to mac-auth. In order for mac-auth authentication type to work, the
server interface should receive at least one frame containing a client's device source MAC address.
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the entry.
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Whether server config is enabled or not.
```
```
guest-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094;
Default: !guest-vlan-id)
```
```
Assigned VLAN when end devices does not support dot1x authentication and no mac-auth fall back is
configured. The setting will apply after 3 retrans-timeout periods. Once dot1x enabled client is
created and successful re-authentication happened, the port is removed from the guest VLAN. This
setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge vlan-filtering is
enabled. By default, guest VLAN is disabled.
```
```
interface (string; Default: ) Name of the interface or interface list the server will run on.
```
```
interim-update (time; Default: 0s) Interval between scheduled RADIUS Interim-Update messages.
```
```
mac-auth-mode (mac-as-username |
mac-as-username-and-password;
Default: mac-as-username)
```
```
Allows to control User-Name and User-Password RADIUS attributes when using MAC authentication.
```
```
radius-mac-format (XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-
XX | XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX |
XXXXXXXXXXXX | xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx
| xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx | xxxxxxxxxxxx;
Default: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)
```
```
Controls how the MAC address of the client is encoded in the User-Name and User-Password attributes
when using MAC authentication.
```
```
When a dot1x server is created on a bridge port, the bridge should be running (R/M)STP, otherwise EAP packets from the client will not be
correctly accepted. Bridge interface is created with protocol-mode=rstp by default. If the bridge port should not send any BPDUs or any
received BPDUs should be ignored, use edge=yes configuration on bridge ports.
```
```
reauth-timeout (time; Default: !reauth-
timeout)
```
```
Enables server port re-authentication. When enabled with dot1x authentication type, server will try to re-
authenticate a client by sending EAP-Request Identity to the client. When enabled with mac-auth
authentication type, server will try to re-authenticate client with RADIUS server by using the last seen
MAC address. This setting is available since RouterOS 7.2 version. By default, re-authentication is
disabled.
```
```
reject-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094;
Default: !reject-vlan-id)
```
```
Assigned VLAN when authentication failed and a RADIUS server responded with an Access-Reject
message. This property will not apply if the RADIUS server is not responding at all, the client
authentication will simply timeout and the service will be unavailable. This property only has an effect
when bridge vlan-filtering is enabled. By default, reject VLAN is disabled.
```
```
retrans-timeout (time; Default: 30s) Time interval between message re-transmissions if no response is received from supplicant.
```
```
server-fail-vlan-id (integer: 1..4094;
Default: !server-fail-vlan-id)
```
```
Assigned VLAN when RADIUS server is not responding and request timeout has elapsed. This setting is
available since RouterOS 7.2 version and has an effect when bridge vlan-filtering is enabled. By
default, server-fail VLAN is disabled.
```

```
Examples
Below are described the most common configuration examples for dot1x server and client.
RouterOS Authenticator configuration
Start off by adding a new RADIUS client. The authentication server (RADIUS) does not necessary have to be in the same LAN as authenticator, but it
must be reachable from the authenticator, so any firewall limitations must be considered.
```
/radius
add address=10.1.2.3 secret=radiussecret service=dot1x
```
Add new dot1x server instances.
```
/interface dot1x server
add interface=ether2 interim-update=30s comment=accounted
add interface=ether12 accounting=no comment=notaccounted
```
Port based VLAN ID assignment
It is possible to assign an authenticated interface to a specific VLAN ID using bridge VLAN filtering. This can be done using RADIUS Tunnel-Type,
Tunnel-Medium-Type and Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attributes. Note that only devices with hardware offloaded VLAN filtering will be able to do this in
switch chip.
```
If RADIUS communication is done over public network, it is advised to use RadSec for RADIUS communication. More information: RADIUS
```
First of all, make sure the interface is added to a bridge which has VLAN filtering enabled.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether12
```
It is necessary to add static VLAN configuration for tagged VLAN traffic to be sent over ether1 interface.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=2
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=12
```
With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, Tunnel attributes are
received in Access-Accept message from RADIUS server:
```
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 64 from 10.1.2.3:1812
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet Tunnel-Type = 13
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet Tunnel-Medium-Type = 6
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet Tunnel-Private-Group-ID = "12"
(..)
09:51:45 radius,debug,packet User-Name = "dot1x-user"
```
The VLAN ID is now present in active session list and untagged ports are added to previously created static VLAN configuration.
```
/interface dot1x server active print
0 interface=ether12 username="dot1x-user" user-mac=00:0C:42:EB:71:F6 session-id="86b00006" vlan=12
```
```
/interface bridge vlan print detail
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
0 D bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=1 tagged="" untagged="" current-tagged="" current-untagged=bridge1,ether3
```
```
1 bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=2 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether2
```
```
2 bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=12 tagged=ether1 untagged="" current-tagged=ether1 current-untagged=ether12
```
Dynamic switch rule configuration
In some network configurations, additional access rules are needed for a particular supplicant to restrict or allow certain network services. This can be
done using a Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute, please see the RADIUS vendor dictionary. When a client is successfully authenticated by an
authentication server, the server can pass back the Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attribute. Based on the received information, the authenticator will create
dynamic access rules on a switch port where the client resides. These rules will be active as long as the client session is active and the interface is
running. There are certain order and restrictions regarding correct switch rule implementation:
```
The mac-protocol, src-mac-address (available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), src-address (IPv4/mask, available only since
RouterOS 7.2 version), dst-address (IPv4/mask), protocol (IPv4) src-port (L4, available only since RouterOS 7.2 version), dst-port
(L4) conditional parameters are supported
Hexadecimal or decimal representation can be used for mac-protocol and protocol parameters (e.g. protocol 17 or protocol 0x11)
The src-port and dst-port support single or range values (e.g. src-port 10 or src-port 10-20)
The src-mac-address support "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" or "xxxxxxxxxxxx" formats, and switch rule without any source MAC address can be set
with "none" keyword (e.g. src-mac-address none)
The src-mac-address (if not already set by the attribute), switch and ports conditional parametrs are automatically set for each rule
Each rule should end with an action property, supported values are either drop or allow. If no action property is set, the default allow value
will be used.
Multiple rules are supported for a single supplicant and they must be separated by a comma ","
```
Below are some examples of Mikrotik-Switching-Filter attributes and dynamic switch rules they create:
```
# Drop ARP frames (EtherType: 0x0806 or 2054)
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2054 action drop"
```
```
/interface ethernet switch rule print

```
```
# Allow UDP (IP protocol: 0x11 or 17) destination port 100 and drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "protocol 17 dst-port 100 action allow, action drop"
```
```
/interface ethernet switch rule print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D ;;; dot1x dynamic
switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:11:22:33/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF protocol=udp dst-

```
```

```
```
# Allow only authenticated source MAC address, drop all other packets
Mikrotik-Switching-Filter = "action allow, src-mac-address none action drop"
```
```
/interface ethernet switch rule print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic
0 D ;;; dot1x dynamic
switch=switch1 ports=ether1 src-mac-address=CC:2D:E0:01:6D:EB/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF copy-to-cpu=no

```
```
1 D ;;; dot1x dynamic
switch=switch1 ports=ether1 copy-to-cpu=no redirect-to-cpu=no mirror=no new-dst-ports=""
```
In our example, Supplicant2 on ether2 is only allowed to access the 192.168.50.0/24 network with UDP destination port 50, all other traffic should be
dropped. First, make sure that hardware offloading is working on bridge ports, otherwise switch rules might not work properly.
```
/interface bridge port print

1 H ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10
10 none
2 H ether12 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10
10 none
```
With enabled RADIUS debug logs it is possible to see complete RADIUS message packets with all attributes. In our example, Mikrotik-Switching-Filter
attribute is received in Access-Accept message from Radius server:
```
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet received Access-Accept with id 121 from 10.1.2.3:1812
(..)
02:35:38 radius,debug,packet MT-Switching-Filter = "mac-protocol 2048 dst-address 192.168.50.0/24 dst-
port 50 protocol 17 action allow,action drop"
```
The dynamic switch rules are now present under the switch menu:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D ;;; dot1x dynamic

```
RouterOS Supplicant configuration
CA certificates are required for eap-tls, eap-ttls and eap-peap authentication methods. Additionally a client certificate is required for eap-tls
method. For this example we have already imported a P12 certificate bundle with self signed client and CA certificates. For more information how to
import certificates in RouterOS, please visit System/Certificates.
```
/certificate print

Simply add a new dot1x client instance that will initiate authentication process.
```
/interface dot1x client
add anon-identity=anonymous client-certificate=dot1x-client eap-methods=eap-tls identity=dot1x-user
interface=ether1 password=dot1xtest
```
If authentication was successful, the interface should have status authenticated.
```

```
Dynamic switch rules will only apply to RouterBoards with switch rule support - CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CCR2216,
and devices with QCA8337, Atheros8327 and Atheros8316 switch chips. CRS1xx/2xx series switches do no support this functionality. Take
into consideration the maximum number of rules for each device, see CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, CCR2216 table and basic switch chip

IP HotSpot
IP HotSpot Active
IP HotSpot Host
IP Binding
Cookies
Using DHCP option to advertise HotSpot URL
```

## Introduction
The MikroTik HotSpot Gateway provides authentication for clients before access to public networks.

## HotSpot Gateway features:
```
different authentication methods of clients, using a local client database on the router, or remote RADIUS server;
users accounting in a local database on the router, or on remote RADIUS server;
a walled-garden system, access to some web pages without authorization;
login page modification, where you can put information about the company;
automatic and transparent change any IP address of a client to a valid address;
HotSpot can inform DHCP clients that they are behind a captive portal (RFC7710);
```
A hotspot can work reliably only when IPv4 is used. Hotspot relies on Firewall NAT rules which currently are not supported for IPv6.

## Example
```
Hotspot (captive portal) - uses web-proxy and it is capable of using only the default routing table, at the moment. Making the PCC(per
connection-classifier) not a valid method, due to the, multiple routing tables used.

The menu is designed to manage the HotSpot servers of the router. It is possible to run HotSpot on Ethernet, wireless, VLAN, and bridge interfaces. One
HotSpot server is allowed per interface. When HotSpot is configured on the bridge interface, set HotSpot interface as bridge interface, not as bridge port,
do not add public interfaces to bridge ports. You can add HotSpot servers manually to the /ip/hotspot menu, but it is advised to run /ip/hotspot/setup, which
adds all necessary settings.

Using DHCP option to advertise HotSpot URL
Most devices, such as modern smartphones, do some kind of background checking to see if they are behind a captive portal. They do this by requesting a
known webpage and comparing the contents of that page, to what they should be. If contents are different, the device assumes there is a login page and
creates a popup with this login page.
This does not always happen, as this "known webpage" could be blocked, whitelisted, or not accessible in internal networks. To improve on this
mechanism, RFC 7710 was created, allowing the HotSpot to inform all DHCP clients that they are behind a captive-portal device and that they will need to
authenticate to get Internet access, regardless of what webpages they do or do not request.
This DHCP option field is enabled automatically, but only if the router has a DNS name configured and has a valid SSL certificate (so that the login page
can be accessed over HTTPS). When these requirements are met, a special DHCP option will be sent, containing a link to https://<dns-name-of-
hotspot>/api. This link contains information in JSON format, instructing the client device of the captive portal status, and the location of the login page.
Contents of https://<dns-name-of-hotspot>/api are as follows:

### {
```
"captive": $(if logged-in == 'yes')false$(else)true$(endif),
"user-portal-url": "$(link-login-only)",
$(if session-timeout-secs != 0)
"seconds-remaining": $(session-timeout-secs),
$(endif)
$(if remain-bytes-total)
"bytes-remaining": $(remain-bytes-total),
$(endif)
"can-extend-session": true
}
```
Some devices require venue-info URL as well, so you are free to modify the api.json file to your liking, just like any other hotspot files. It is located in the
router files menu.
```
Important
```
```
If you have set up Hotspot before RouterOS v7.3 when RFC 7710 was implemented, you will have to use "Reset HTML" function, or manually
add/edit the api.json file to have the above contents, for Hotspot detection to work.
```

# Hotspot customisation

## Requirements
```
HotSpot captive portal
```

## Introduction
You can create a completely different set of servlet pages for each HotSpot server you have, specifying the directory in the "html-override-directory"
property of a HotSpot server profile /ip hotspot profile. The default servlet pages are copied in the directory "hotspot" directory right after you create the
server profile. This directory can be accessed by connecting to the router with an FTP client. You can copy this directory and modify the pages as you like
using the information from this section of the manual. Note that it is suggested to edit the files manually, as automated HTML editing tools may corrupt the
pages by removing variables or other vital parts. After you are finished with content modification you need to upload this modified content to some custom
directory on the hotspot router and point previously mentioned property "html-override-directory" value as path to this new custom HTML directory.
Note: If "html-override-directory" value path is missing or empty then the hotspot server will revert to default HTML files.

## Available Pages
Main HTML servlet pages, which are shown to the user:
```
redirect.html - redirects the user to another URL (for example, to the login page)
login.html - login page shown to a user to ask for a username and password. This page may take the following parameters:
username - username
password - either plain-text password (in case of PAP authentication) or MD5 hash of chap-id variable, password, and CHAP challenge
(in case of CHAP authentication). This value is used as e-mail address for trial users
dst - original URL requested before the redirect. This will be opened on successful login
popup - whether to pop-up a status window on successful login
radius<id> - send the attribute identified with <id> in text string form to the RADIUS server (in case RADIUS authentication is used; lost
otherwise)
radius<id>u - send the attribute identified with <id> in unsigned integer form to the RADIUS server (in case RADIUS authentication is
used; lost otherwise)
radius<id>-<vnd-id> - send the attribute identified with <id> and vendor ID <vnd-id> in text string form to the RADIUS server (in case
RADIUS authentication is used; lost otherwise)
radius<id>-<vnd-id>u - send the attribute identified with <id> and vendor ID <vnd-id> in unsigned integer form to the RADIUS server (in
case RADIUS authentication is used; lost otherwise)
md5.js - JavaScript for MD5 password hashing. Used together with http-chap login method
alogin.html - page shown after a client has logged in. It pops-up status page and redirects the browser to the originally requested page (before he
/she was redirected to the HotSpot login page)
status.html - status page, shows statistics for the client. It is also able to display advertisements automatically
logout.html - logout page, shown after a user is logged out. Shows final statistics about the finished session. This page may take the following
additional parameters:
erase-cookie - whether to erase cookies from the HotSpot server on logout (makes it impossible to log in with cookie next time from the
same browser, might be useful in multiuser environments)
error.html - error page, shown on fatal errors only
```
Some other pages are available as well, if more control is needed:
```
rlogin.html - page, which redirects the client from some other URL to the login page, if authorization of the client is required to access that URL
rstatus.html - similar to rlogin.html, only in case if the client is already logged in and the original URL is not known
radvert.html - redirects the client to the scheduled advertisement link
flogin.html - shown instead of login.html, if some error has happened (invalid username or password, for example)
fstatus.html - shown instead of redirect, if a status page is requested, but the client is not logged in
flogout.html - shown instead of redirect, if logout page is requested, but the client is not logged in
```

## Serving Servlet Pages
The HotSpot servlet recognizes 5 different request types:
```
request for a remote host
if user is logged in and advertisement is due to be displayed, radvert.html is displayed. This page redirects to the scheduled
advertisement page
if user is logged in and advertisement is not scheduled for this user, the requested page is served
if user is not logged in, but the destination host is allowed by the walled garden, then the request is also served
```

### 3.

### 4.

### 5.
```
if user is not logged in, and the destination host is disallowed by the walled garden, rlogin.html is displayed; if rlogin.html is not found,
redirect.html is used to redirect to the login page
```
```
request for "/" on the HotSpot host
if user is logged in, rstatus.html is displayed; if rstatus.html is not found, redirect.html is used to redirect to the status page
if user is not logged in, rlogin.html is displayed; if rlogin.html is not found, redirect.html is used to redirect to the login page
```
```
request for "/login" page
if user has successfully logged in (or is already logged in), alogin.html is displayed; if alogin.html is not found, redirect.html is used to
redirect to the originally requested page or the status page (in case, the original destination page was not given)
if user is not logged in (username was not supplied, no error message appeared), login.html is showed
if login procedure has failed (an error message is supplied), flogin.html is displayed; if flogin.html is not found, login.html is used
in case of fatal errors, error.html is showed
```
```
request for "/status" page
if user is logged in, status.html is displayed
if user is not logged in, fstatus.html is displayed; if fstatus.html is not found, redirect.html is used to redirect to the login page
```
```
request for '/logout' page
if user is logged in, logout.html is displayed
if user is not logged in, flogout.html is displayed; if flogout.html is not found, redirect.html is used to redirect to the login page
```
Note: If it is not possible to meet a request using the pages stored on the router's FTP server, Error 404 is displayed
There are many ways to customize what the HotSpot authentication pages look like:
```
The pages are easily modifiable. They are stored on the router's FTP server in the directory you choose for the respective HotSpot server profile.
By changing the variables, which client sends to the HotSpot servlet, it is possible to reduce the keyword count to one (username or password; for
example, the client's MAC address may be used as the other value) or even to zero (License Agreement; some predefined values general for all
users or client's MAC address may be used as username and password)
Registration may occur on a different server (for example, on a server that is able to charge Credit Cards). Client's MAC address may be passed
to it, so that this information doesn't have to be entered manually. After the registration, the server should change RADIUS database enabling
client to log in for some amount of time.
```
To insert a variable in some place in the HTML file, the $(var_name) syntax is used, where the "var_name" is the name of the variable (without quotes).
This construction may be used in any HotSpot HTML file accessed as '/', '/login', '/status' or '/logout', as well as any text or HTML (.txt, .htm or .html) file
stored on the HotSpot server (with the exception of traffic counters, which are available in status page only, and error, error-orig, chap-id, chap-challenge
and popup variables, which are available in login page only). For example, to show a link to the login page, following construction can be used:
```
<a href="$(link-login)">login</a>
```
Variables
All of the Servlet HTML pages use variables to show user specific values. Variable names appear only in the HTML source of the servlet pages - they are
automatically replaced with the respective values by the HotSpot Servlet. For most variables, there is an example of their possible value included in
brackets. All the described variables are valid in all servlet pages, but some of them just might be empty at the time they are accessed (for example, there
is no uptime before a user has logged in).
List of available variables

"" otherwise)
radius<id>-<vnd-id>u - show the attribute identified with <id> and vendor ID <vnd-id> in unsigned integer form (in case RADIUS authentication
was used; "0" otherwise)
```
Working with variables
$(if <var_name>) statements can be used in these pages. The following content will be included, if value of <var_name> will not be an empty string. It is an
equivalent to $(if <var_name> != "") It is possible to compare on equivalence as well: $(if <var_name> == <value>) These statements have effect until $(elif
<var_name>), $(else) or $(endif). In general case it looks like this:
```
some content, which will always be displayed
$(if username == john)
Hey, your username is john
$(elif username == dizzy)
Hello, Dizzy! How are you? Your administrator.
$(elif ip == 10.1.2.3)
You are sitting at that old computer, which is so slow...
$(elif mac == 00:01:02:03:04:05)
This is an ethernet card, which was stolen few months ago...
$(else)
I don't know who you are, so lets live in peace.
$(endif)
other content, which will always be displayed
```
Only one of those expressions will be shown. Which one - depends on the values of those variables for each client.
Redirects and custom Headers
```
$(if http-status == 302)Hotspot login required$(endif)
$(if http-header == "Location")$(link-redirect)$(endif)
```
Note: Although the above appears to use the conditional expression 'if' it is in fact setting the 'http-status' to '302' not testing for it. Also the same for the
variable 'http-header'. Once again, even though it uses an 'if' it is in fact setting the variable to 'Location' followed by the URL set from the variable 'link-
redirect'.
For example, in the case where $(link-redirect) evaluates to "http://192.168.88.1/login", then the HTTP response returned to the client will be changed to:
```
HTTP/1.0 302 Hotspot login required
<regular HTTP headers>
Location: http://192.168.88.1/login
```
http-status syntax:
```
$(if http-status == XYZ)HTTP_STATUS_MESSAGE$(endif)
```
```
XYZ - The status code you wish to return. Should be 3 decimal digits, the first one must not be 0
HTTP_STATUS_MESSAGE - any text you wish to return to the client that will follow the above status code in the HTTP reply
```
In any HTTP response it will be on the first line and will be as follows:
```
HTTP/1.0 XYZ HTTP_STATUS_MESSAGE
```
http-header syntax:
```
$(if http-header == HTTP_HEADER_NAME)HTTP_HEADER_VALUE$(endif)
```
```
HTTP_HEADER_NAME - name of the HTTP header to be sent in the response
HTTP_HEADER_VALUE - the value of the HTTP header with the name HTTP_HEADER_NAME to be sent in the response
```
The HTTP response will appear as:
```
HTTP_HEADER_NAME: HTTP_HEADER_VALUE
```
All variables and conditional expressions within HTTP_HEADER_VALUE and HTTP_STATUS_MESSAGE are processed as usual.
In case multiple headers with the same name are added, then only the last one will be used (previous ones will be discarded). It allows the system to
override regular HTTP headers (for example, Content-Type and Cache-Control).
Customizing Error Messages
All error messages are stored in the errors.txt file within the respective HotSpot servlet directory. You can change and translate all these messages to your
native language. To do so, edit the errors.txt file. You can also use variables in the messages. All instructions are given in that file.
Multiple Versions of HotSpot Pages
Multiple HotSpot page sets for the same HotSpot server are supported. They can be chosen by the user (to select language) or automatically by
JavaScript (to select PDA/regular version of HTML pages).
To utilize this feature, create subdirectories in the HotSpot HTML directory, and place those HTML files, which are different, in that subdirectory. For
example, to translate everything in Latvian, the subdirectory "lv" can be created with login.html, logout.html, status.html, alogin.html, radvert.html and errors.
txt files, which are translated into Latvian. If the requested HTML page can not be found in the requested subdirectory, the corresponding HTML file from
the main directory will be used. Then main login.html file would contain a link to "/lv/login?dst=$(link-orig-esc)", which then displays Latvian version of login
page: <a href="/lv/login?dst=$(link-orig-esc)">Latviski</a>. And Latvian version would contain a link to English version: <a href="/login?dst=$(link-orig-
esc)">English</a>
Another way of referencing directories is to specify 'target' variable:
```
<a href="$(link-login-only)?dst=$(link-orig-esc)&target=lv">Latviski</a>
<a href="$(link-login-only)?dst=$(link-orig-esc)&target=%2F">English</a>
```
After the preferred directory has been selected (for example, "lv"), all links to local HotSpot pages will contain that path (for example, $(link-status) = "http://
hotspot.mt.lv/lv/status"). So, if all HotSpot pages reference links using "$(link-xxx)" variables, then no more changes are to be made - each client will stay
within the selected directory all the time.
Misc
If you want to use the HTTP-CHAP authentication method, you need to include the doLogin() function (which references to the md5.js which must be
already loaded) before the Submit action of the login form. Otherwise, CHAP login will fail.
The resulting password to be sent to the HotSpot gateway in case of HTTP-CHAP method, it is formed by MD5-hashing the concatenation of the following:
chap-id, the password of the user, and chap-challenge (in the given order)
In case variables are to be used in the link directly, then they must be escaped accordingly. For example, in login page, <a href="https://login.example.com
/login?mac=$(mac)&user=$(username)">link</a> will not work as intended, if username will be "123&456=1 2". In this case instead of $(user), its escaped
version must be used: $(user-esc): <a href="https://login.server.serv/login?mac=$(mac-esc)&user=$(user-esc)">link</a>. Now the same username will be
converted to "123%26456%3D1+2", which is the valid representation of "123&456=1 2" in URL. This trick may be used with any variables, not only with
$(username).
There is a boolean parameter "erase-cookie" to the logout page, which may be either "on" or "true" to delete user cookie on logout (so that the user would
not be automatically logged on when he/she opens a browser next time.
Examples
With basic HTML language knowledge and the examples below it should be easy to implement the ideas described above.
```
To provide predefined value as username, in login.html change:
```
```
<type="text" value="$(username)>
```
to this line:
```
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="hsuser">
```
(where hsuser is the username you are providing)
```
To provide a predefined value as a password, in login.html change:
```
```
<input type="password">
```
to this line:
```
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="hspass">
```
(where hspass is the password you are providing)
```
To send the client's MAC address to a registration server in the form of:
```
https://www.example.com/register.html?mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
change the Login button link in login.html to:
```
https://www.example.com/register.html?mac=$(mac)
```
(you should correct the link to point to your server)
```
To show a banner after user login, in alogin.html after
```
$(if popup == 'true') add the following line:
```
open('http://www.example.com/your-banner-page.html', 'my-banner-name','');
```
(you should correct the link to point to the page you want to show)
```
To choose a different page shown after login, in login.html change:
```
```
<input type="hidden" name="dst" value="$(link-orig)">
```
to this line:
```
<input type="hidden" name="dst" value="http://www.example.com">
```
(you should correct the link to point to your server)
```
To erase the cookie on logoff, in the page containing a link to the logout (for example, in status.html) change:
```
```
open('$(link-logout)', 'hotspot_logout', ...
```
to this:
```
open('$(link-logout)?erase-cookie=on', 'hotspot_logout', ...
```
or alternatively add this line:
```
<input type="hidden" name="erase-cookie" value="on">
```
before this one:
```
<input type="submit" value="log off">
```
External authentication
Another example is making HotSpot to authenticate on a remote server (which may, for example, perform credit card charging):
```
Allow direct access to the external server in walled-garden (either HTTP-based or IP-based)
Modify the login page of the HotSpot servlet to redirect to the external authentication server. The external server should modify the RADIUS
database as needed
```
Here is an example of such a login page to put on the HotSpot router (it is redirecting to https://auth.example.com/login.php, replace with the actual
address of an external authentication server):
```
<html>
<title>...</title>
<body>
<form name="redirect" action="https://auth.example.com/login.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="mac" value="$(mac)">
<input type="hidden" name="ip" value="$(ip)">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="$(username)">
<input type="hidden" name="link-login" value="$(link-login)">
<input type="hidden" name="link-orig" value="$(link-orig)">
<input type="hidden" name="error" value="$(error)">
</form>
<script language="JavaScript">
<!--
document.redirect.submit();
//-->
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
```
The external server can log in a HotSpot client by redirecting it back to the original HotSpot servlet login page, specifying the correct username
and password
```
Here is an example of such a page (it is redirecting to https://hotspot.example.com/login, replace with the actual address of a HotSpot router; also, it is
displaying [http://www.mikrotik.com](http://www.mikrotik.com) after successful login, replace with what is needed):
```
<html>
<title>Hotspot login page</title>
<body>
<form name="login" action="https://hotspot.example.com/login" method="post">
<input type="text" name="username" value="demo">
<input type="password" name="password" value="none">
<input type="hidden" name="domain" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="dst" value="http://www.mikrotik.com/">
<input type="submit" name="login" value="log in">
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
```
Hotspot will ask the RADIUS server whether to allow the login or not. If allowed, alogin.html page will be displayed (it can be modified to do
anything). If not allowed, the flogin.html (or login.html) page will be displayed, which will redirect the client back to the external authentication
server.
```
Note: as shown in these examples, HTTPS protocol and POST method can be used to secure communications.
HTTP header detection
The Hotspot login pages have access to HTTP headers by using $(http-header-name);
For example, there exists an ability to check the user agent (or browser), and will return any other content instead of the regular login page, if so desired.
This can be used to disable automatic popups in phones, for example.
For example, to output "SUCCESS" for users of a specific Firefox mobile version, instead of the login page, you can these lines on the top of the rlogin.html
page in your hotspot directory:
```
$(if user-agent == "Mozilla/5.0 (Android; Mobile; rv:40.0) Gecko/40.0 Firefox/40.0" )
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Success</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>Success</BODY></HTML>
$(else)
---- regular content of rlogin.html page ----
$(endif)
```
This will DISABLE the login popup for Android Firefox 40 users.
One-click login
It is possible to create a modified captive portal for quick one-click login for scenarios where no user or password is required.
What you need to do is:
```
Create a user for this purpose. In example, it is "notsosecretuser" with password "notsosecretpass"
Assign this user to a user profile that allows a specific/unlimited amount of simultaneous active users.
Copy original hotspot directory that is already generated in routers file menu on root level.
Modify the contents of this copy directory contents.
Only one file requires modifications for this to work, the "login.html".
```
Original:
```
<table width="100" style="background-color: #ffffff">
<tr><td align="right">login</td>
<td><input style="width: 80px" name="username" type="text" value="$(username)"/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="right">password</td>
<td><input style="width: 80px" name="password" type="password"/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td> </td>
<td><input type="submit" value="OK" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
```
Modified:
```
<table width="100" style="background-color: #ffffff">
<tr style="display:none;"><td align="right">login</td>
<td><input style="width: 80px" name="username" type="text" value="notsosecretuser"/></td>
</tr>
<tr style="display:none;"><td align="right">password</td>
<td><input style="width: 80px" name="password" type="password" value="notsosecretpass"/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td> </td>
<td><input type="submit" value="Proceed to Internet!" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
```
What changed:
```
User and Password "" fields are hidden.
Both User and Password field values contain predefined values.
Changed the "OK" button value(name) to something more fitting.
```
```
Now upload this new hotspot folder back to the router, preferably with a different name.
Change settings in the hotspot server profile to use this new html directory.
```
```
/ip hotspot profile set (profile number or name) html-directory-override=(dir path/name)
```
Firewall customizations
Summary
Apart from the obvious dynamic entries in the /ip hotspot submenu itself (like hosts and active users), some additional rules are added in the firewall tables
when activating a HotSpot service.
NAT
From /ip firewall nat print dynamic command, you can get something like this (comments follow after each of the rules):
```
0 D chain=dstnat action=jump jump-target=hotspot hotspot=from-client
```
Putting all HotSpot-related tasks for packets from all HotSpot clients into a separate chain.
```
1 I chain=hotspot action=jump jump-target=pre-hotspot
```
Any actions that should be done before HotSpot rules apply, should be put in the pre-hotspot chain. This chain is under full administrator control and does
not contain any rules set by the system, hence the invalid jump rule (as the chain does not have any rules by default).
```
2 D chain=hotspot action=redirect to-ports=64872 dst-port=53 protocol=udp
3 D chain=hotspot action=redirect to-ports=64872 dst-port=53 protocol=tcp
```
Redirect all DNS requests to the HotSpot service. The 64872 port provides DNS service for all HotSpot users. If you want the HotSpot server to listen to
another port, add rules here the same way, changing dst-port property.
```
4 D chain=hotspot action=redirect to-ports=64873 hotspot=local-dst dst-port=80
protocol=tcp
```
Redirect all HTTP login requests to the HTTP login servlet. The 64873 is HotSpot HTTP servlet port.
```
5 D chain=hotspot action=redirect to-ports=64875 hotspot=local-dst dst-port=443
protocol=tcp
```
Redirect all HTTPS login requests to the HTTPS login servlet. The 64875 is HotSpot HTTPS servlet port.
```
6 D chain=hotspot action=jump jump-target=hs-unauth hotspot=!auth protocol=tcp
```
All other packets except DNS and login requests from unauthorized clients should pass through the hs-unauth chain.
```
7 D chain=hotspot action=jump jump-target=hs-auth hotspot=auth protocol=tcp
```
And packets from the authorized clients - through the hs-auth chain.
```
8 D ;;; http://www.mikrotik.com
chain=hs-unauth action=return dst-address=66.228.113.26 dst-port=80 protocol=tcp
```
First in the hs-unauth chain is put everything that affects TCP protocol in the /ip hotspot walled-garden ip submenu (i.e., everything where either
protocol is not set, or set to TCP). Here we are excluding [http://www.mikrotik.com](http://www.mikrotik.com) from being redirected to the login page.
```
9 D chain=hs-unauth action=redirect to-ports=64874 dst-port=80 protocol=tcp
```
All other HTTP requests are redirected to the Walled Garden proxy server which listens to the 64874 port. If there is an "allow" entry in the /ip hotspot
walled-garden menu for an HTTP request, it is being forwarded to the destination. Otherwise, the request will be automatically redirected to the HotSpot
login servlet (port 64873).
```
10 D chain=hs-unauth action=redirect to-ports=64874 dst-port=3128 protocol=tcp
11 D chain=hs-unauth action=redirect to-ports=64874 dst-port=8080 protocol=tcp
```
HotSpot by default assumes that only these ports may be used for HTTP proxy requests. These two entries are used to "catch" client requests to unknown
proxies (you can add more rules here for other ports). I.e., to make it possible for the clients with unknown proxy settings to work with the HotSpot system.
This feature is called "Universal Proxy". If it is detected that a client is using some proxy server, the system will automatically mark those packets with the
HTTP hotspot mark to work around the unknown proxy problem, as we will see later on. Note that the port used (64874) is the same as for HTTP requests
in rule #9 (so both HTTP and HTTP proxy requests are processed by the same code).
```
12 D chain=hs-unauth action=redirect to-ports=64875 dst-port=443 protocol=tcp
```
HTTPS proxy is listening on the 64875 port.
```
13 I chain=hs-unauth action=jump jump-target=hs-smtp dst-port=25 protocol=tcp
```
Redirect for SMTP protocol may also be defined in the HotSpot configuration. In case it is, a redirect rule will be put in the hs-smtp chain. This is done so
that users with unknown SMTP configuration would be able to send their mail through the service provider's (your) SMTP server instead of going to the
[possibly unavailable outside their network of origin] SMTP server users have configured on their computers. The chain is empty by default, hence the
invalid jump rule.
```
14 D chain=hs-auth action=redirect to-ports=64874 hotspot=http protocol=tcp
```
Providing HTTP proxy service for authorized users. Authenticated user requests may need to be subject to transparent proxying (the "Universal Proxy"
technique and advertisement feature). This HTTP mark is put automatically on the HTTP proxy requests to the servers detected by the HotSpot HTTP
proxy (the one that is listening on the 64874 port) as HTTP proxy requests for unknown proxy servers. This is done so that users that have some proxy
settings would use the HotSpot gateway instead of the [possibly unavailable outside their network of origin] proxy server users have configured in their
computers. This mark is also applied when an advertisement is due to be shown to the user, as well as on any HTTP requests from the users whose
profile is configured to transparently proxy their requests.
```
15 I chain=hs-auth action=jump jump-target=hs-smtp dst-port=25 protocol=tcp
```
Providing SMTP proxy for authorized users (the same as in rule #13).
Packet Filtering
From /ip firewall filter print dynamic command, you can get something like this (comments follow after each of the rules):
```
0 D chain=forward action=jump jump-target=hs-unauth hotspot=from-client,!auth
```
Any packet that traverse the router from an unauthorized client will be sent to the hs-unauth chain. The hs-unauth implements the IP-based Walled Garden
filter.
```
1 D chain=forward action=jump jump-target=hs-unauth-to hotspot=to-client,!auth
```
Everything that comes to clients through the router, gets redirected to another chain, called hs-unauth-to. This chain should reject unauthorized requests to
the clients.
```
2 D chain=input action=jump jump-target=hs-input hotspot=from-client
```
Everything that comes from clients to the router itself, gets to yet another chain, called hs-input.
```
3 I chain=hs-input action=jump jump-target=pre-hs-input
```
Before proceeding with [predefined] dynamic rules, the packet gets to the administratively controlled pre-hs-input chain, which is empty by default, hence
the invalid state of the jump rule.
```
4 D chain=hs-input action=accept dst-port=64872 protocol=udp
5 D chain=hs-input action=accept dst-port=64872-64875 protocol=tcp
```
Allow client access to the local authentication and proxy services (as described earlier).
```
6 D chain=hs-input action=jump jump-target=hs-unauth hotspot=!auth
```
All other traffic from unauthorized clients to the router itself will be treated the same way as the traffic traversing the routers.
```
7 D chain=hs-unauth action=return protocol=icmp
8 D ;;; http://www.mikrotik.com
chain=hs-unauth action=return dst-address=66.228.113.26 dst-port=80 protocol=tcp
```
Unlike the NAT table where only TCP-protocol related Walled Garden entries were added, in the packet filter hs-unauth chain is added to everything you
have set in the /ip hotspot walled-garden ip menu. That is why although you have seen only one entry in the NAT table, there are two rules here.
```
9 D chain=hs-unauth action=reject reject-with=tcp-reset protocol=tcp
10 D chain=hs-unauth action=reject reject-with=icmp-net-prohibited
```
Everything else that has not been white-listed by the Walled Garden will be rejected. Note the usage of TCP Reset for rejecting TCP connections.
```
11 D chain=hs-unauth-to action=return protocol=icmp
12 D ;;; http://www.mikrotik.com
chain=hs-unauth-to action=return src-address=66.228.113.26 src-port=80 protocol=tcp
```
The same action as in rules #7 and #8 is performed for the packets destined to the clients (chain hs-unauth-to) as well.
```
13 D chain=hs-unauth-to action=reject reject-with=icmp-host-prohibited
```
Reject all packets to the clients with an ICMP reject message.

## Summary
Sub-menu: /ppp
The MikroTik RouterOS provides scalable Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) functionality.
Local authentication is performed using the User Database and the Profile Database. The actual configuration for the given user is composed using the
respective user record from the User Database, the associated item from the Profile Database, and the item in the Profile database which is set as default
for a given service the user is authenticating to. Default profile settings from the Profile database have the lowest priority while the user access record
settings from the User Database have the highest priority with the only exception being particular IP addresses take precedence over IP pools in the local-
address and remote-address settings, which are described later on.
Support for RADIUS authentication gives the ISP or network administrator the ability to manage PPP user access and accounting from one server
throughout a large network. The MikroTik RouterOS has a RADIUS client that can authenticate for PPP, PPPoE, PPTP, L2TP, OPVN, and ISDN
connections. The attributes received from the RADIUS server override the ones set in the default profile, but if some parameters are not received they are
taken from the respective default profile.

## User Profiles
Sub-menu: /ppp profile
PPP profiles are used to define default values for user access records stored under /ppp secret submenu. Settings in /ppp secret User Database
overrides corresponding /ppp profile settings except that single IP addresses always take precedence over IP pools when specified as local-address
or remote-address parameters.

0 * name="default" use-compression=no use-encryption=no only-one=no
change-tcp-mss=yes
1 * name="default-encryption" use-compression=default use-encryption=yes
only-one=default change-tcp-mss=default
[admin@rb13] ppp profile>
```
incoming-filter and outgoing-filter arguments add dynamic jump rules to chain ppp, where the jump-target argument will be equal to incoming-filter or outgoi
ng-filter argument in the profile. Therefore, chain ppp should be manually added before changing these arguments.
only-one parameter is ignored if RADIUS authentication is used.

Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
accounting
(yes | no;
Default: yes
)
```
```
Enable RADIUS accounting
```
```

RADIUS.
```
```
enable-
ipv6-
accountin
g (yes | no
; Default:
no)
```
```
Enable IPv6 separate accounting. PPP service counts Layer2, IPv4 and IPv6 data all together when reporting network usage statistics to
the RADIUS server by default. If it is required to differ IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, then this option can be enabled. Prerequisites for it to work are
that the prefix must be assigned to the client through PPP service and also rate-limit must be provided. Dynamically created queue
statistics will be used as counters for IPv6 data, which then will be included in accounting packets as separate IPv6 statistics attributes.
This will not work for prefixes assigned by dynamically created DHCPv6 server due to provided prefix pool or PPP/Profile configuration.
Then prefix assignment is handled by DHCP service, not PPP, thus accounting can not be managed by PPP service.
```
Examples
Add new profile
To add the profile ex that assigns the router itself the 10.0.0.1 address, and the addresses from the ex pool to the clients, filtering traffic coming from
clients through mypppclients chain:
```
[admin@rb13] ppp profile> add name=ex local-address=10.0.0.1 remote-address=ex incoming-filter=mypppclients
[admin@rb13] ppp profile> print

# RADIUS

## Summary
RADIUS, short for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, is a remote server that provides authentication and accounting facilities to various network
appliances. RADIUS authentication and accounting allows the ISP or network administrator to manage PPP user access and accounting from one server
throughout a large network. The MikroTik RouterOS has a RADIUS client that can authenticate router's local users, HotSpot, PPP, PPPoE, PPTP, L2TP, O
VPN, SSTP, IPsec and ISDN connections. The attributes received from the RADIUS server override the ones set in the default profile, but if some
parameters are not received they are taken from the respective default profile.
The RADIUS server database is consulted only if no matching user access record is found in the router's local database.
If RADIUS accounting is enabled, accounting information is also sent to the RADIUS server default for that service.

```
Example
To set up a RADIUS Client for HotSpot and PPP services that will authenticate against a RADIUS Server (10.0.0.3), you need to do the following:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /radius add service=hotspot,ppp address=10.0.0.3 secret=ex
[admin@MikroTik] > /radius print
Flags: X - disabled
# SERVICE CALLED-ID DOMAIN ADDRESS SECRET
0 ppp,hotspot
```
To set up a RADIUS Client with RadSec, you need to do the following:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /radius add service=hotspot,ppp address=10.0.0.3 secret=radsec protocol=radsec
certificate=client.crt
[admin@MikroTik] > /radius print
Flags: X - disabled
# SERVICE CALLED-ID DOMAIN ADDRESS SECRET
0 ppp,hotspot 10.0.0.3 radsec
```
To view RADIUS Client statistics, you need to do the following:
```
When the RADIUS server is authenticating the user with CHAP, MS-CHAPv1, MS-CHAPv2, it is not using a shared secret, the secret is used
only in the authentication reply, and the router (RADIUS client) verifies it. So if you have the wrong shared secret, the RADIUS server will accept
a request, but the router won't accept the reply. You can see that with "/radius monitor" command, the "bad-replies" number should increase
whenever somebody tries to connect.
```
```
If RadSec is enabled, make sure your RADIUS Server is using "radsec" as the shared secret, otherwise, the RADIUS Server will not be able to
decrypt data correctly (unprintable characters). With RadSec RouterOS forces the shared secret to "radsec" regardless of what has been set
manually. For more details see - RFC6614.
```
```
Make sure the specified certificate is trusted.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /radius monitor 0
pending: 0
requests: 10
accepts: 4
rejects: 1
resends: 15
timeouts: 5
bad-replies: 0
last-request-rtt: 0s
```
Make sure you enable RADIUS authentication for the desired services:
```
/ppp aaa set use-radius=yes
/ip hotspot profile set default use-radius=yes
```
Connection Terminating from RADIUS
```
Sub-menu: /radius incoming
```
This facility supports unsolicited messages sent from the RADIUS server. Unsolicited messages extend RADIUS protocol commands, that allow
terminating a session that has already been connected from the RADIUS server. For this purpose, DM (Disconnect-Messages) is used. Disconnect
messages cause a user session to be terminated immediately.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
accept (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to accept unsolicited messages
```
```
port (integer; Default: 1700 ) The port number to listen for the requests on
```
```
vrf (VRF name; default value: main) Set VRF on which service is listening for incoming connections
```
```
RouterOS doesn't support POD (Packet of Disconnect) the other RADIUS access request packet that performs a similar function as Disconnect
Messages

## Summary
MikroTik RouterOS router user facility manages the users connecting the router from any of the Management tools. The users are authenticated using
either a local database or a designated RADIUS server. Each user is assigned to a user group, which denotes the rights of this user. A group policy is a
combination of individual policy items.
In case the user authentication is performed using RADIUS, the RADIUS client should be previously configured.

## User Settings
The settings submenu allows to control the password complexity requirements of the router users.
```
Property Description
```
```
minimum-password-length (integer; 0..4294967295;
Default: )
```
```
Specifies the minimum character length of the user password
```
```
minimum-categories (integer; 0..4; Default: ) Specifies the complexity requirements of the password, with categories being uppercase,
lowercase, digit, symbol.
```

## User Groups
The router user groups provide a convenient way to assign different permissions and access rights to different user classes.

```
Config Policies:
```
```
reboot - policy that allows rebooting the router
read - policy that grants read access to the router's configuration. All console commands
that do not alter the router's configuration are allowed. Doesn't affect FTP
write - policy that grants write access to the router's configuration, except for user
management. This policy does not allow to read the configuration, so make sure to
enable read policy as well
policy - policy that grants user management rights. Should be used together with the
write policy. Allows also to see global variables created by other users (requires also
'test' policy). Allows to design skins (requires also "sensitive" policy).
test - policy that grants rights to run ping, traceroute, bandwidth-test, wireless scan,
snooper, fetch, email and other test commands
sensitive - grants rights to change "hide sensitive" option, if this policy is disabled
sensitive information is not displayed.
sniff - policy that grants rights to use packet sniffer tool, traffic generator.
```
```
skin (name; Default: default) Used skin for WebFig
```
Default groups
There are three default system groups which cannot be deleted:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user group print
0 name="read" policy=local,telnet,ssh,reboot,read,test,winbox,password,web,sniff,sensitive,api,romon,rest-api,!
ftp,!write,!policy skin=default
```
```
1 name="write" policy=local,telnet,ssh,reboot,read,write,test,winbox,password,web,sniff,sensitive,api,romon,

```
```
2 name="full" policy=local,telnet,ssh,ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,winbox,password,web,sniff,sensitive,api,
romon,rest-api skin=default
```
Please note, that even the "read" group includes sensitive, reboot, and other important policies, meaning that this group should not be given to untrusted
users. For truly limited groups, make a custom group, defining specific policies. All groups have access to file operations. Exclamation sign '!' just before
the policy item name means NOT.

## Overview
User Manager is RADIUS server implementation in RouterOS which provides centralized user authentication and authorization to a certain service. Having
a central user database allows better tracking of system users and customers. As a separate package, User Manager is available on all architectures
except SMIPS, however, care must be taken due to limited free space available. It supports many different authentication methods including PAP, CHAP,
MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-PEAP. In RouterOS, DHCP, Dot1x, Hotspot, IPsec, PPP, and Wireless are features that benefit
from User Manager the most. Each user can see their account statistics and manage available profiles using the WEB interface. Additionally, users can
buy their own data plans (profiles) using the most popular payment gateway - PayPal making it a great system for service providers. Customized reports
can be generated to ease processing by the billing department. User Manager works according to RADIUS standards defined in RFC2865 and RFC3579.
User Manager is one of the RouterOS features, that is limited by the RouterOS license level. Depending on the License level, number of active sessions
will be limited, including multiple connections per user (not unique accounts).
Attributes
Sub-menu: /user-manager attribute
RADIUS attributes are defined authorization, information, and configuration parameters that are passed between the RADIUS server and the client. User
Manager allows sending customized attributes defined in the "attributes" menu. RouterOS has a set of predefined attributes already present, but it is also
possible to add additional attributes if necessary. Predefined attributes:

Datarate limitation for clients. The format is: rx-rate[/tx-rate] [rx-burst-rate[/tx-burst-rate] [rx-burst-threshold[
/tx-burst-threshold] [rx-burst-time[/tx-burst-time] [priority] [rx-rate-min[/tx-rate-min]]]] from the point of view of
the router (so "rx" is client upload, and "tx" is client download). All rates should be numbers with optional 'k'
(1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If the tx-rate is not specified, the rx-rate is as tx-rate too. The same goes for tx-
burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not
specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate are used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time
and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as default. Priority takes values 1..8, where 1 implies the
highest priority, but 8 - the lowest. If rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min are not specified rx-rate and tx-rate values
are used. The rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min values can not exceed rx-rate and tx-rate values.

Database
Sub-menu: /user-manager database
All RADIUS-related information is stored in a separate User Manager's database configurable under the "database" sub-menu. "Enabled" and "db-path"
are the only parameters that are not stored in the User Manager's database and instead are stored in the main RouterOS configuration table meaning that
these parameters will be affected by the RouterOS configuration reset. The rest of the configuration, session, and payment data is stored in a separate
SQLite database on the FLASH storage of the device. When performing any actions with databases, it is advised to make a backup before and after any
activity.

Limitations
Sub-menu: /user-manager limitation
Limitations are used by Profiles and are linked together by Profile-Limitations. RADIUS accounting and Interim updates must be enabled to seamlessly
switch between multiple limitations or disconnect active sessions when download-limit, upload-limit or uptime-limit is reached.
To disconnect already active sessions from User Manager, accept must be set to yes on the RADIUS client side. If simultaneous session limits are not
unlimited (shared-users) and it has reached the maximum allowed number, then the router will try to disconnect the older user session first.
User-Manager attempts to disconnect an active session before a new user will be accepted (when the appropriate limit is set), that's why in such setups it
is suggested to use 1s for /radius client timeout.

Application Guides
Batch user creation
It is possible to create multiple new users with randomly generated usernames and passwords. For example, the following command will generate 3 new
users with 6 lowercase symbols as the username and 6 lowercase, uppercase, and numbers as the password.
```
/user-manager user
add-batch-users number-of-users=3 password-characters=lowercase,numbers,uppercase password-length=6 username-
characters=lowercase username-length=6
```
The command generated users can be seen by printing the user's table:
```
/user-manager user print
Flags: X - disabled
0 name="olsgkl" password="86a6zH" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes=""
```
```
1 name="lkbwss" password="jaKY5V" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes=""
```
```
2 name="cwxbwu" password="a62yZd" otp-secret="" group=default shared-users=1 attributes=""
```
Providing NAS with custom RADIUS attributes
It is possible to send additional RADIUS attributes during the authentication process to provide NAS with custom information about the session, such as
what IP address should be assigned to the supplicant or what address pool to use for address assigning.
Static IP address for a user
To assign the end user a static IP address, Framed-IP-Address attribute can be used. When using static IP address allocation, shared-sessions must be
set to 1 to prevent cases when a user has multiple simultaneous sessions, but there is only one IP address. For example:
```
/user-manager user
set [find name=username] shared-users=1 attributes=Framed-IP-Address:192.168.1.4
```
Specifying address pool for a group of users
We can group up multiple similar users and assign RADIUS attributes to all of them at once. First of all, create a new group:
```
/user-manager user group
add name=location1 outer-auths=chap,eap-mschap2,eap-peap,eap-tls,eap-ttls,mschap1,mschap2,pap \
inner-auths=peap-mschap2,ttls-chap,ttls-mschap1,ttls-mschap2,ttls-pap attributes=Framed-Pool:pool1
```
The next step is to assign a user to the group:
```
/user-manager user
set [find name=username] group=location1
```
In this case, an IP address from pool1 will be assigned to the user upon authentication - make sure pool1 is created on the NAS device.
Using TOTP (time-based one-time password) for user authentication
User Manager supports time-based authentication token addition to the user's password field that is regenerated every 30 seconds.
TOTP works by having a shared secret on the supplicant (client) and the authentication server (User Manager). To configure TOTP on RouterOS, simply
set the otp-secret for the user. For example:
```
/user-manager user
set [find name=username] password=mypass otp-secret=mysecret
```
To calculate the TOTP token on the supplicant side, many widely available applications can be used, for example, Google Authenticator or https://totp.app/.
Adding mysecret to the TOTP token generator will provide a new unique 6-digit code that must be added to the user password.
The following example will accept the user's authentication with a calculated TOTP token added to the common password until a new TOTP token is
generated, for example,
```
User-Name=username
User-Password=mypass620872
```
Exporting user credentials
```
OTP depends on the clock, so make sure time settings are configured correctly.
```
Printable login credentials for a single user
To generate a single user's printable voucher card, simply use the generate-voucher command. Specify the RouterOS ID number of the user or use the find
command to specify a username. A template is already included in User Manager's installation available in the Files section of your device. You can
customize the template for your needs.
```
/user-manager user
generate-voucher voucher-template=printable_vouchers.html [find where name=username]
```
The generated voucher card is available by accessing the router using a WEB browser and navigating to /um/PRIVATE/GENERATED/vouchers
/gen_printable_vouchers.html
By default, the printable card looks like this:
It is possible to use different variables when generating vouchers. Currently, supported variables are:
$(username) - Represents User Manager username
$(password) - Password of the username
$(userprofname) - Profile that is active for the particular user
$(userprofendtime) - Profile validity end time if specified
Multiple user credential export
It is possible to generate a CSV or XML file with multiple or all user credentials at once by using the export.xml or export.csv as voucher-template.
```
/user-manager user
generate-voucher voucher-template=export.xml [find]
```
The command generates an XML file um5files/PRIVATE/GENERATED/vouchers/gen_export.xml which can either be accessible by the WEB browser or
any other file access tools.
```
To access the PRIVATE path of the /um/ directory by the WEB browser, private-username and private-password must be configured. See Settin
gs section.
```
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<users>
<user>
<username>olsgkl</username>
<password>86a6zH</password>
</user>
<user>
<username>lkbwss</username>
<password>jaKY5V</password>
</user>
<user>
<username>cwxbwu</username>
<password>a62yZd</password>
</user>
<user>
<username>username</username>
<password>secretpassword</password>
</user>
```
```
</users>
```
Generating usage report
In cases where presentable network usage information is required by companies billing or legal team an automated session export can be created using
the generate-report command. The command requires an input of the report template - an example of the template is available in um5files/PRIVATE
/TEMPLATES/reports/report_default.html. Example of the report generation:
```
/user-manager
generate-report report-template=report_default.html columns=username,uptime,download,upload
```
The generated report is available by accessing the router using a WEB browser and navigating to /um/PRIVATE/GENERATED/reports/gen_report_default.
html
Purchasing a profile
After logging into the user's private profile by accessing the router's /um/ directory using a WEB browser, for example, http://example.com/um/, he will be
able to see all available Profiles in the respective menu. Profiles that have specified price values will have a Buy this Profile button available.
After pressing the Buy this Profile button, the user will be asked to choose from available transaction service providers (currently only PayPal is available)
and later redirected to PayPal's payment processing page.
When the payment is completed, the User Manager will ask PayPal to approve the transaction. After approval, the profile is assigned to the user and is
ready to use.
Migrating from RouterOS v6
When you upgrade your User Manager router from RouterOS v6 to the v7 the new User Manager will work with new database files and configuration. To
continue using the old user, router, profile, etc. configuration you must manually execute the migrate command. To do so you must have files from the old
User Manager server folder "user-manager" present. The folder can be renamed, but all the contents from the old installation must be transferred to the
new v7 installation (you can move the old configuration from one router to another router with v7, you must copy "user-manager" folder). After that, all you
need to do is execute this command - "/user-manager/database/migrate-legacy-db database-path=<path_to_old_user_manager_folder>".
The import process will try to convert such configuration - users, profiles, user-profiles, limitations, profile-limitations, user-counters, routers, and sessions.
Application Examples
Basic L2TP/IPsec server with User Manager authentication
User Manager configuration
Start off by enabling User Manager functionality.
```
/user-manager
set enabled=yes
```
Allow receiving RADIUS requests from the localhost (the router itself).
```
/user-manager router
add address=127.0.0.1 comment=localhost name=local shared-secret=test
```
Next, add users and their credentials that clients will use to authenticate to the server.
```
/user-manager user
add name=user1 password=password
```
Configuring RADIUS client
For the router to use the RADIUS server for user authentication, it is required to add a new RADIUS client that has the same shared secret that we already
configured on User Manager.
```
/radius
add address=127.0.0.1 secret=test service=ipsec
```
L2TP/IPsec server configuration
Configure the IP pool from which IP addresses will be assigned to the users and assign it to the PPP Profile.
```
/ip pool
add name=vpn-pool range=192.168.99.2-192.168.99.100
```
```
/ppp profile
set default-encryption local-address=192.168.99.1 remote-address=vpn-pool
```
Enable the use of RADIUS for PPP authentication.
```
/ppp aaa
set use-radius=yes
```
Enable the L2TP server with IPsec encryption.
```
/interface l2tp-server server
set enabled=yes use-ipsec=required ipsec-secret=mySecret
```
That is it. Your router is now ready to accept L2TP/IPsec connections and authenticate them to the internal User Manager.
MFA authentication for RouterOS user login
As User-Manager supports TOTP (time-based-one-time password), it is possible to setup so called MFA authentication for different services. Here will will
look into RouterOS user authentication over User Manager (radius) with time based password, that is changed every 30 seconds.
Here are the necessary configuration options on your MikroTik router,
Enable to use RADIUS for /user menu, and set default-grop from /user group menu. Keep in mind that local /user database is checked first, and then
RADIUS is contacted.
/user/aaa/set use-radius=yes default-group=full
Enable radius client for login service. As we run User Manager on the same router, 127.0.0.1 is used,
/radius/add address=127.0.0.1 service=login secret=mystrongsecret
Here are the configuration steps for User Manager,
Make sure you have added your managed devices to "Routers" menu,
/user-manager/router/add name=myrouter address=127.0.0.1 shared-secret=mystrongsecret
Add user to User-Manager user table with OTP secret parameter. Few more steps are required for proper OTP configuration.
Pick OTP-secret name and convert it to base32 format (there are plenty of online converters from utf-8 to base32 format). For my configuration I use
"mysupersecret", that in base32 would be NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI===
/user-manager/user/add name=mikrotik password=mysuperpassword otp-secret="NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI==="
Note, than in your favorite authenticator app, you will need to set user this key manually "NV4XG5LQMVZHGZLDOJSXI===", when adding new time
password instance.
To login to your MikroTik device, open Winbox/Console and connect to your router address, use login:mikrotik and password:mysuperpasswordxxxxxx,
where xxxxxx is 6 digit code from your favorite authentication app.
Password is changed every 30 seconds and it is available from your favorite app.

## Summary
Ethernet-like networks (Ethernet, Ethernet over IP, IEEE 802.11 in ap-bridge or bridge mode, WDS, VLAN) can be connected together using MAC
bridges. The bridge feature allows the interconnection of hosts connected to separate LANs (using EoIP, geographically distributed networks can be
bridged as well if any kind of IP network interconnection exists between them) as if they were attached to a single LAN. As bridges are transparent,
they do not appear in the traceroute list, and no utility can make a distinction between a host working in one LAN and a host working in another LAN if
these LANs are bridged. However, depending on the way the LANs are interconnected, latency and data rate between hosts may vary.
Network loops may emerge (intentionally or not) in complex topologies. Without any special treatment, loops would prevent the network from
functioning normally, as they would lead to avalanche-like packet multiplication. Each bridge runs an algorithm that calculates how the loop can be
prevented. (R/M)STP allows bridges to communicate with each other, so they can negotiate a loop-free topology. All other alternative connections that
would otherwise form loops are put on standby, so that should the main connection fail, another connection could take its place. This algorithm
exchanges configuration messages (BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit) periodically, so that all bridges are updated with the newest information about
changes in a network topology. (R/M)STP selects a root bridge which is responsible for network reconfiguration, such as blocking and opening ports
on other bridges. The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest bridge ID.
Bridge Interface Setup
To combine a number of networks into one bridge, a bridge interface should be created. Later, all the desired interfaces should be set up as its ports.
By default, bridge MAC address will be chosen automatically, depending on the bridge port configuration. To avoid unwanted MAC address changes,
it is recommended to disable "auto-mac" and manually specifying the MAC address by using "admin-mac".
Sub-menu: /interface bridge
```
Property Description
```
```
add-dhcp-option82 (ye
s | no; Default: no)
```
```
Whether to add DHCP Option-82 information (Agent Remote ID and Agent Circuit ID) to DHCP packets. Can be used
together with Option-82 capable DHCP server to assign IP addresses and implement policies. This property only has an
effect when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
admin-mac (MAC
address; Default: none
)
```
```
Static MAC address of the bridge. This property only has an effect when auto-mac is set to no.
```
```
ageing-time (time;
Default: 00:05:00)
```
```
How long a host's information will be kept in the bridge database.
```

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.
arp (disabled |
enabled | local-proxy-
arp | proxy-arp | reply-
only; Default: enabled)
```
Address Resolution Protocol setting
```
```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface
proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
reply-only - the interface will only respond to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address
combinations that are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in
the IP/ARP table. Therefore, for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
```
arp-timeout (auto |
integer; Default: auto)
```
How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from IP address. Value auto equals to the
value of arp-timeout in ip/settings, default is 30s.
```
auto-mac (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
When auto-mac=yes is configured, the bridge will automatically select a MAC address for the bridge interface based on
the following order of priority:
```
```
From an Ethernet interface that is part of the bridge;
From a non-Ethernet interface in the bridge (e.g., WiFi or tunnel);
A randomly generated address if neither of the above is available.
```
```
If the configuration is changed, for example, you add a new port to the bridge, the bridge’s MAC address will be updated
only if a higher-priority address source becomes available. For example, if the bridge initially used a randomly generated
MAC, then an Ethernet interface was added, the MAC would update according to the highest available priority (in this
case, the Ethernet interface). The bridge will also update the MAC address if the current MAC is associated with a port that
is moved to a different bridge.
```
```
The current MAC address and its priority level are saved and will be reused after a reboot.
```
```
When auto-mac=no is configured, you can set a static MAC address manually using the admin-mac property.
```
comment (string;
Default: )
```
Short description of the interface.
```
dhcp-snooping (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
Enables or disables DHCP Snooping on the bridge.
```
disabled (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
Changes whether the bridge is disabled.
```
ether-type (0x9100 |
0x8100 | 0x88a8;
Default: 0x8100)
```
Changes the EtherType, which will be used to determine if a packet has a VLAN tag. Packets that have a matching
EtherType are considered as tagged packets. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
fast-forward (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
Special and faster case of Fast Path which works only on bridges with 2 interfaces (enabled by default only for new
bridges). More details can be found in the Fast Forward section.
```
forward-delay (time;
Default: 00:00:15)
```
The time which is spent during the initialization phase of the bridge interface (i.e., after router startup or enabling the
interface) in the listening/learning state before the bridge will start functioning normally.
```
forward-reserved-
addresses (yes | no:
Default: no)
```
Whether to forward IEEE reserved multicast MAC address that are in the 01:80:C2:00:00:0x range. Bridges compliant with
R/M/STP standards should refrain from forwarding these packets, this property can only be applied when protocol-mode
 is set to none.
```
```
Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to
enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links,
using bridge as media converters, or conducting network analysis).
```
```
Here are some notable MAC addresses and protocols used by RouterOS:
```
```
01:80:C2:00:00:00 - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP);
01:80:C2:00:00:01 - Ethernet Flow Control;
01:80:C2:00:00:02 - Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP);
01:80:C2:00:00:03 - Dot1x client and server;
01:80:C2:00:00:08 - Spanning Tree Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using ether-type=0x88a8);
01:80:C2:00:00:0D - Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, using ether-type=0x88a8);
01:80:C2:00:00:0E - Link Layer Discovery Protocol and Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group;
```
frame-types (admit-all
| admit-only-untagged-
and-priority-tagged |
admit-only-vlan-
tagged; Default: admit
-all)
```
Specifies allowed frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
igmp-snooping (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
Enables multicast group and port learning to prevent multicast traffic from flooding all interfaces in a bridge.
```
igmp-version (2 | 3;
Default:  2 )
```
Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an
IGMP querier. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
ingress-filtering (yes |
no; Default: yes)
```
Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the
bridge VLAN table. By default, VLANs that don't exist in the bridge VLAN table are dropped before they are sent out
(egress), but this property allows you to drop the packets when they are received (ingress). Should be used with frame-
types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect when vlan-
filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.
```
l2mtu (read-only;
Default: )
```
L2MTU indicates the maximum size of the frame without a MAC header that can be sent by this interface. The L2MTU
value will be automatically set by the bridge and it will use the lowest L2MTU value of any associated bridge port. This
value cannot be manually changed.
```
last-member-interval (t
ime; Default: 1s)
```
When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes to a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the
bridge will send group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes
the response time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (last-member-
interval * last-member-query-count), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).
```
```
If the bridge port is configured with fast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.
```
```
This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
last-member-query-
count (integer: 0..
4294967295 ; Default:  2
)
```
How many times should last-member-interval pass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain
multicast stream. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
max-hops (integer: 6..
40 ; Default:  20 )
```
Bridge count which BPDU can pass in an MSTP enabled network in the same region before BPDU is being ignored. This
property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.
```
```
The Flow Control MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:01 is an exception, it does not get forwarded by the bridge.
```
max-learned-entries (i
nteger: 0..
4294967295 | auto |
unlimited; Default: auto
)
```
Sets the maximum number of learned hosts for the bridge interface. The default value is auto, and it depends on the
installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default or choose unlimited option, but it increases
the risk of out-of-memory condition.
```
```
The default values for certain RAM sizes:
```
```
8192 for 64 MB;
16384 for 128 MB;
32768 for 256 MB;
65536 for 512 MB;
131072 for 1024 MB or higher.
```
```
This limit specifically applies to the bridge interface, not the hardware limits on the switch FDB table. Even if the bridge
limit is reached, the switch can continue learn hosts up to its hardware limits and make correct forwarding decisions.
However, these additional hosts will not show up in the "/interface bridge host" table nor can be monitored.
Additionally, hitting this limit could impact MLAG host synchronization.
```
```
This setting has been available since RouterOS version 7.16.
```
max-message-age (ti
me: 6s..40s; Default:  0
0:00:20)
```
Changes the Max Age value in BPDU packets, which is transmitted by the root bridge. A root bridge sends a BPDUs with
Max Age set to max-message-age value and a Message Age of 0. Every sequential bridge will increment the Message
Age before sending their BPDUs. Once a bridge receives a BPDU where Message Age is equal or greater than Max Age,
the BPDU is ignored. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp or rstp.
```
membership-interval (t
ime; Default: 4m20s)
```
The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are
received on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
mld-version (1 | 2;
Default:  1 )
```
Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an
MLD querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address, igmp-snooping and multica
st-querier is set to yes.
```
mtu (integer; Default:
auto)
```
Maximum transmission unit, by default, the bridge will set MTU automatically and it will use the lowest MTU value of any
associated bridge port. The default bridge MTU value without any bridge ports added is 1500. The MTU value can be set
manually, but it cannot exceed the bridge L2MTU or the lowest bridge port L2MTU. If a new bridge port is added with
L2MTU which is smaller than the actual-mtu of the bridge (set by the mtu property), then manually set value will be
ignored and the bridge will act as if mtu=auto is set.
```
```
When adding VLAN interfaces on the bridge, and when VLAN is using higher MTU than default 1500, it is recommended
to set manually the MTU of the bridge.
```
multicast-querier (yes
| no; Default: no)
```
Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices
respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.
```
```
By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge to generate IGMP/MLD general membership
queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network.
Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries
will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.
```
```
Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with IPv4 0.0.0.0 source
address, MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an
external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring values igmp-querier and mld-querier).
```
```
This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
multicast-router (disab
led | permanent |
temporary-query;
Default: temporary-
query)
```
A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast
streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge
interface itself. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to the bridge interface for further
multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
disabled - disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD
membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.
permanent - enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD
membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.
temporary-query - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries.
```
name (text; Default: br
idgeN)
```
Name of the bridge interface.
```
port-cost-mode (long
| short; Default: long)
```
Changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic values based on interface
speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configured path-cost  or internal-path-cost
properties. Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate
calculations for intermediate rates):
```
```
Data rate Long Short
```
```
10 Mbps 2,000,000 100
```
```
100 Mbps 200,000 19
```
```
1 Gbps 20,000 4
```
```
10 Gbps 2,000 2
```
```
25 Gbps 800 1
```
```
40 Gbps 500 1
```
```
50 Gbps 400 1
```
```
100 Gbps 200 1
```
```
For bonded interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied, this value remains unaffected by
the total link speed of the bonding.
```
```
For virtual interfaces (such as VLAN, EoIP, VXLAN), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000
is assigned for long mode, and 10 for short mode.
```
```
For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10
for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to bridge, for
instance, by using the CAPsMAN datapath.bridge-cost setting.
```
```
Use port monitor to observe the applied path-cost.
```
```
This property has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp, rstp, or mstp.
```
priority (integer: 0..
65535 decimal format
or 0x0000-0xffff hex
format; Default:  32768
/ 0x8000)
```
Bridge priority, used by R/STP to determine root bridge, used by MSTP to determine CIST and IST regional root bridge.
This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
```
protocol-mode (none
| rstp | stp | mstp;
Default: rstp)
```
Select Spanning tree protocol (STP) or Rapid spanning tree protocol (RSTP) to ensure a loop-free topology for any
bridged LAN. RSTP provides a faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change. Select MSTP to ensure loop-
free topology across multiple VLANs.
```
```
The forwarding of reserved MAC addresses that are in the 01:80:C2:00:00:0x range is separated from protocol-
mode=none, and is now available as a controllable property forward-reserved-addresses since RouterOS v7.16.
```
pvid (integer: 1..4094;
Default:  1 )
```
Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. It applies e.g. to frames sent from
bridge IP and destined to a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
querier-interval (time;
Default: 4m15s)
```
Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect when igmp-
snooping is set to yes.
```
query-interval (time;
Default: 2m5s)
```
Changes the interval on how often IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is
acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes place when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an
effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
query-response-
interval (time; Default:
10s)
```
The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is active as an IGMP/MLD querier.
This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
region-name (text;
Default: )
```
MSTP region name. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.
```
```
region-revision (intege
r: 0..65535; Default:  0 )
```
```
MSTP configuration revision number. This property only has an effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.
```
```
startup-query-count (i
nteger: 0..
4294967295 ; Default:  2
)

Spanning Tree Protocol
RouterOS bridge interfaces are capable of running Spanning Tree Protocol to ensure a loop-free and redundant topology. For small networks with just
2 bridges STP does not bring many benefits, but for larger networks properly configured STP is very crucial, leaving STP-related values to default may
result in a completely unreachable network in case of an even single bridge failure. To achieve a proper loop-free and redundant topology, it is
necessary to properly set bridge priorities, port path costs, and port priorities.
STP has multiple variants, currently, RouterOS supports STP, RSTP, and MSTP. Depending on needs, either one of them can be used, some devices
are able to run some of these protocols using hardware offloading, detailed information about which device support it can be found in the Hardware
Offloading section. STP is considered to be outdated and slow, it has been almost entirely replaced in all network topologies by RSTP, which is
backward compatible with STP. For network topologies that depend on VLANs, it is recommended to use MSTP since it is a VLAN aware protocol and
gives the ability to do load balancing per VLAN groups. There are a lot of considerations that should be made when designing an STP enabled
network, more detailed case studies can be found in the Spanning Tree Protocol article. In RouterOS, the protocol-mode property controls the used
STP variant.
Per-port STP
There might be certain situations where you want to limit STP functionality on single or multiple ports. Below you can find some examples for different
use cases.
```
In RouterOS it is possible to set any value for bridge priority between 0 and 65535, the IEEE 802.1W standard states that the bridge priority
must be in steps of 4096. This can cause incompatibility issues between devices that do not support such values. To avoid compatibility
issues, it is recommended to use only these priorities: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056,
49152, 53248, 57344, 61440
```
```
RouterOS bridge does not work with PVST and its variants. The PVST BPDUs (with a MAC destination 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CD) are treated
by RouterOS bridges as typical multicast packets. In simpler terms, they undergo RouterOS bridge/switch forwarding logic and may get
tagged or untagged.
```
```
By the IEEE 802.1ad standard, the BPDUs from bridges that comply with IEEE 802.1Q are not compatible with IEEE 802.1ad bridges, this
means that the same bridge VLAN protocol should be used across all bridges in a single Layer2 domain, otherwise (R/M)STP will not
function properly.
```
Create edge ports
Setting a bridge port as an edge port will restrict it from sending BPDUs and will ignore any received BPDUs:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 edge=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```
Drop received BPDUs
The bridge filter or NAT rules cannot drop BPDUs when the bridge has STP/RSTP/MSTP enabled due to the special processing of BPDUs. However,
dropping received BPDUs on a certain port can be done on some switch chips using ACL rules:
On CRS3xx:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add dst-mac-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-dst-ports="" ports=ether1 switch=switch1
```
On CRS1xx/CRS2xx with Access Control List (ACL) support:
```
/interface ethernet switch acl
add action=drop mac-dst-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00 src-ports=ether1
```
In this example all received BPDUs on ether1 are dropped.
Enable BPDU guard
In this example, if ether1 receives a BPDU, it will block the port and will require you to manually re-enable it.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 bpdu-guard=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```
Enable Root guard
In this example, ether1 is configured with restricted-role=yes. It prevented the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI,
regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it
continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network
administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree.
```
Be careful when changing the default (R/M)STP functionality, make sure you understand the working principles of STP and BPDUs.
Misconfigured (R/M)STP can cause unexpected behavior.
```
```
If you intend to drop received BPDUs on a port, then make sure to prevent BPDUs from being sent out from the interface that this port is
connected to. A root bridge always sends out BPDUs and under normal conditions is waiting for a more superior BPDU (from a bridge with
a lower bridge ID), but the bridge must temporarily disable the new root-port when transitioning from a root bridge to a designated bridge. If
you have blocked BPDUs only on one side, then a port will flap continuously.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 restricted-role=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```
```

Bridge Settings
Under the bridge settings menu, it is possible to control certain features for all bridge interfaces and monitor global bridge counters.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge settings
```
Property Description
```
```
use-ip-firewall
(yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Force bridged traffic to also be processed by prerouting, forward, and postrouting sections of IP routing (see more details on Packet
Flow article). This does not apply to routed traffic. This property is required in case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Qu
eue Tree to traffic in a bridge. Property use-ip-firewall-for-vlan is required in case bridge vlan-filtering is used.
```
```
use-ip-
firewall-for-
pppoe (yes |
no; Default: no
)
```
```
Send bridged un-encrypted PPPoE traffic to also be processed by IP/Firewall. This property only has an effect when use-ip-
firewall is set to yes. This property is required in case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Tree to PPPoE
traffic in a bridge.
```
```
use-ip-
firewall-for-
vlan (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Send bridged VLAN traffic to also be processed by IP/Firewall. This property only has an effect when use-ip-firewall is set to
yes. This property is required in case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Tree to VLAN traffic in a bridge.
```
```
allow-fast-
path (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Whether to enable a bridge Fast Path globally.
```
```
bridge-fast-
path-active (y
es | no;
Default: )
```
```
Shows whether a bridge FastPath is active globally, Fast Path status per bridge interface is not displayed.
```
```
bridge-fast-
path-packets (
integer;
Default: )
```
```
Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Path.
```
```
bridge-fast-
path-bytes (int
eger; Default: )
```
```
Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Path.
```
```
bridge-fast-
forward-
packets (integ
er; Default: )
```
```
Shows packet count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward.
```
```
bridge-fast-
forward-bytes (
integer;
Default: )
```
```
Shows byte count forwarded by bridge Fast Forward.
```
Port Settings
Port submenu is used to add interfaces in a particular bridge.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge port
```
Property Description
```
```
auto-isolate (y
es | no;
Default: no)
```
```
When enabled, prevents a port moving from discarding into forwarding state if no BPDUs are received from the neighboring
bridge. The port will change into a forwarding state only when a BPDU is received. This property only has an effect when protoco
l-mode is set to rstp or mstp and edge is set to no.
```
```
bpdu-guard (y
es | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables or disables BPDU Guard feature on a port. This feature puts the port in a disabled role if it receives a BPDU and requires
the port to be manually disabled and enabled if a BPDU was received. Should be used to prevent a bridge from BPDU related
attacks. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
```
```
bridge (name;
Default: none)
```
```
The bridge interface where the respective interface is grouped in.
```
```
broadcast-
flood (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
When enabled, bridge floods broadcast traffic to all bridge egress ports. When disabled, drops broadcast traffic on egress ports.
Can be used to filter all broadcast traffic on an egress port. Broadcast traffic is considered as traffic that uses FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF a
s destination MAC address, such traffic is crucial for many protocols such as DHCP, ARP, NDP, BOOTP (Netinstall), and others.
This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU.
```
```
edge (auto |
no | no-
discover | yes
| yes-discover;
Default: auto)
```
```
Set port as edge port or non-edge port, or enable edge discovery. Edge ports are connected to a LAN that has no other bridges
attached. An edge port will skip the learning and the listening states in STP and will transition directly to the forwarding state, this
reduces the STP initialization time. If the port is configured to discover edge port then as soon as the bridge detects a BPDU
coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
```
```
no - non-edge port, will participate in learning and listening states in STP.
no-discover - non-edge port with enabled discovery, will participate in learning and listening states in STP, a port can
become an edge port if no BPDU is received.
yes - edge port without discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.
yes-discover - edge port with enabled discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.
auto - same as no-discover, but will additionally detect if a bridge port is a Wireless interface with disabled bridge-mode,
such interface will be automatically set as an edge port without discovery.
```
```
fast-leave (yes
| no; Default: no
)
```
```
Enables IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when an
IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
In case you want to assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees to traffic that is being forwarded by a bridge, then you need to enable the
use-ip-firewall property. Without using this property the bridge traffic will never reach the postrouting chain, Simple Queues and global
Queue Trees are working in the postrouting chain. To assign Simple Queues or global Queue Trees for VLAN or PPPoE traffic in a bridge
you should enable appropriate properties as well.
```
frame-types (a
dmit-all |
admit-only-
untagged-and-
priority-tagged
| admit-only-
vlan-tagged;
Default: admit-
all)
```
Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
ingress-
filtering (yes |
no; Default: yes
)
```
Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge
VLAN table. Should be used with frame-types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only
has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.
```
learn (auto |
no | yes;
Default: auto)
```
Changes MAC learning behavior on a bridge port
```
```
yes - enables MAC learning
no - disables MAC learning
auto - detects if bridge port is a Wireless interface and uses a Wireless registration table instead of MAC learning, will use
Wireless registration table if the Wireless interface is set to one of ap-bridge, bridge, wds-slave mode and bridge mode
for the Wireless interface is disabled.
```
multicast-
router (disable
d | permanent
| temporary-
query; Default:
temporary-
query)
```
A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and
IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This property
can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to certain bridge ports for further multicast routing or proxying. This property
only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
disabled - disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports
are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.
permanent - enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports
are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.
temporary-query - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries.
```
horizon (intege
r 0..
429496729 ;
Default: none)
```
Use split horizon bridging to prevent bridging loops. Set the same value for a group of ports, to prevent them from sending data to
ports with the same horizon value. Split horizon is a software feature that disables hardware offloading. Read more about Bridge
split horizon.
```
hw (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
Allows to enable or disable hardware offloading on interfaces capable of HW offloading. For software interfaces like EoIP or VLAN
this setting is ignored and has no effect. Certain bridge or port functions can automatically disable HW offloading, use the print
command to see whether the "H" flag is active.
```
internal-path-
cost (integer:
1..200000000;
Default: )
```
Path cost to the interface for MSTI0 inside a region. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the internal-
path-cost based on the interface speed and the port-cost-mode setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove
any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before the internal-path-cost property. This property only has
effect when protocol-mode is set to mstp.
```
```
/interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !internal-path-cost
```
```
Use port monitor to observe the applied internal-path-cost.
```
interface (name
; Default: none)
```
Name of the interface or interface list.
```
path-cost (inte
ger: 1..
200000000 ;
Default: )
```
Path cost to the interface, used by STP and RSTP to determine the best path, and used by MSTP to determine the best path
between regions. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the path-cost based on the interface speed and
the port-cost-mode setting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an
exclamation mark before the path-cost property. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
```
```
/interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !path-cost
```
```
Use port monitor to observe the applied path-cost.
```
```
point-to-point (
auto | yes | no;
Default: auto)
```
```
Specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of failure. By setting this
property to yes, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and
waits for BPDUs from other devices from this single link. By setting this property to no, you are expecting that a link can receive
BPDUs from multiple devices. By setting the property to yes, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In
general, you should only set this property to no if it is possible that another device can be connected between a link, this is mostly
relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex, auto enables point-to-point functionality. This
property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
```
```
priority (integer
: 0..240;
Default:  128 )
```
```
The priority of the interface, used by STP to determine the root port, used by MSTP to determine root port between regions.
```
```
pvid (integer
1..4094;
Default:  1 )
```
```
Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect when vlan-
filtering is set to yes.
```
```
restricted-role (
yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables or disables the restricted role on a port. When enabled, it prevents the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or
any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state)
and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no
longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges
influencing the active spanning tree, a feature also known as root-guard or root-protection. This property has an effect when prot
ocol-mode is set to stp, rstp, or mstp (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).
```
```
restricted-tcn (
yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables or disables topology change notification (TCN) handling on a port. When enabled, it causes the port not to propagate
received topology change notifications to other ports, and any changes caused by the port itself does not result in topology
change notification to other ports. This parameter is disabled by default. It can be set by a network administrator to prevent
external bridges causing MAC address flushing in local network. This property has an effect when protocol-mode is set to stp,
rstp, or mstp (support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).
```
```
tag-stacking (y
es | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN tag regardless if
a VLAN tag already exists, packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the pvid value and will use EtherType that is
specified in ether-type. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
```
trusted (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCP packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to limit unauthorized
servers to provide malicious information for users. This property only has an effect when dhcp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
unknown-
multicast-flood
(yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Changes the multicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding
multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the
specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic, this includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e.
g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1).
```
```
Note that when igmp-snooping is enabled and IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP
multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.
```
```
When using this setting together with igmp-snooping, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known
multicast from the MDB table.
```
```
unknown-
unicast-flood (
yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Changes the unknown unicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows
flooding unknown unicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts unknown unicast traffic from
being flooded to the specified bridge port.
```
```
If a MAC address is not learned in the host table, then the traffic is considered as unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all
ports. MAC address is learned as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received and the source MAC address is added to the
bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is
recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learned.
```
Example
To group ether1 and ether2 in the already created bridge1 interface.
```
RouterOS can handle a maximum of 1024 bridged interfaces per bridge, this limit is fixed and cannot be modified. If you try to add more
interfaces as bridge ports, it may lead to unpredictable behavior.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON
0 ether1 bridge1 yes 100 0x80 10 10 none
1 ether2 bridge1 yes 200 0x80 10 10 none
```
Interface lists
Starting with RouterOS v6.41 it possible to add interface lists as a bridge port and sort them. Interface lists are useful for creating simpler firewall rules.
Below is an example how to add an interface list to a bridge:
```
/interface list
add name=LAN1
add name=LAN2
/interface list member
add interface=ether1 list=LAN1
add interface=ether2 list=LAN1
add interface=ether3 list=LAN2
add interface=ether4 list=LAN2
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN2
```
Ports from an interface list added to a bridge will show up as dynamic ports:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port> pr
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON
0 LAN1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
1 D ether1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
2 D ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
3 LAN2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
4 D ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
5 D ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
```
It is also possible to sort the order of lists in which they appear. This can be done using the move command. Below is an example of how to sort
interface lists:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port move 3 0
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON
0 LAN2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
1 D ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
2 D ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
3 LAN1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
4 D ether1 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
5 D ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
```
Starting from RouterOS version 7.17, you can use interface lists for the tagged and untagged properties in the bridge VLAN table. This change
allows for more flexible VLAN assignment to ports by simply modifying the interface list members, rather than updating each bridge VLAN entry
individually.
```
The second parameter when moving interface lists is considered as "before id", the second parameter specifies before which interface list
should be the selected interface list moved. When moving the first interface list in place of the second interface list, then the command will
have no effect since the first list will be moved before the second list, which is the current state either way.
```
If different interface lists are specified for the tagged and untagged settings, and there is overlap between the interface members, the untagged list
will take priority. You can check the current interface configuration with current-tagged and current-untagged properties using the print
command.
Below is an example where new interfaces are added to already existing interface lists. This shows how the bridge port and VLAN tables are
automatically updated without directly changing settings in those menus.
```
/interface list
add name=vlan10_untagged
add name=vlan20_untagged
add name=vlan_tagged
/interface list member
add interface=ether2 list=vlan10_untagged
add interface=ether3 list=vlan10_untagged
add interface=ether4 list=vlan20_untagged
add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 list=vlan_tagged
/interface bridge

```
```
(R/M)STP algorithm assigned port role:
```
```
disabled-port - disabled or inactive port.
root-port - port that is facing towards the root bridge and has the best (lowest cost) path to the root bridge. Only one root
port is elected per bridge (except the root bridge itself).
alternative-port - port that is facing towards the root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic. Port provides a backup
path to the root bridge if the current root port fails.
designated-port - port that is facing away from the root bridge and forwards traffic away from the root bridge to
downstream devices.
backup-port - port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is going to forward traffic. Port that serves as a backup for a
designated port on the same segment.
```
```
In RouterOS, the role monitoring property displays RSTP roles, such as alternate-port and backup-port, even when STP
mode is enabled. While this is technically incorrect, it does not affect the operation of STP. This is because STP treats all blocked
ports the same, without differentiating their purpose (e.g., as potential backup paths). The displayed roles are simply a reflection of
RSTP functionality and have no practical impact when STP is in use. See more details on STP and RSTP page.
```
```

The total cost of the path to the root-bridge
```
```
sending-rstp (

Hosts Table
MAC addresses that have been learned on a bridge interface can be viewed in the host menu. Below is a table of parameters and flags that can be
viewed.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge host
```
Property Description

```
```
Whether the host has been dynamically created
```
```
external (read-only:
flag)
```
```
Whether the host has been learned using an external table, for example, from a switch chip or Wireless registration table.
Adding a static host entry on a hardware-offloaded bridge port will also display an active external flag
```
```
invalid (read-only:
flag)
```
```
Whether the host entry is invalid, can appear for statically configured hosts on already removed interface
```
```
local (read-only: flag) Whether the host entry is created from the bridge itself (that way all local interfaces are shown)
```
```

```
Monitoring
To get the active hosts table:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge host print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - external
# MAC-ADDRESS VID ON-INTERFACE BRIDGE
0 D B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7 ether1 bridge1

2 DL CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:38 bridge1 bridge1
3 DL CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:39 ether2 bridge1
```
Static entries
It is possible to add a static MAC address entry into the host table. This can be used to forward a certain type of traffic through a specific port. Another
use case for static host entries is to protect the device resources by disabling dynamic learning and relying only on configured static host entries.
Below is a table of possible parameters that can be set when adding a static MAC address entry into the host table.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge host
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (name; Default: none) The bridge interface to which the MAC address is going to be assigned.
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Disables/enables static MAC address entry.
```
```
interface (name; Default: none) Name of the interface.
```
```
mac-address (MAC address; Default: ) MAC address that will be added to the host table statically.
```
```
vid (integer: 1..4094; Default: ) VLAN ID for the statically added MAC address entry.
```
For example, if it was required that all traffic destined to 4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43 is forwarded only through ether2, then the following commands can be
used:
```
/interface bridge host
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43
```
Multicast Table
When IGMP/MLD snooping is enabled, the bridge will start to listen to IGMP/MLD communication, create multicast database (MDB) entries, and make
forwarding decisions based on the received information. Packets with link-local multicast destination addresses 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 are not
restricted and are always flooded on all ports and VLANs. To see learned multicast database entries, use the print command.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge mdb
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (read-only: name) Shows the bridge interface the entry belongs to.
```
```
group (read-only: ipv4 | ipv6 | MAC address) Shows a multicast group address.
```
```
on-ports (read-only: name) Shows the bridge ports which are subscribed to the certain multicast group.
```
```
vid (read-only: integer) Shows the VLAN ID for the multicast group, only applies when vlan-filtering is enabled.
```
```

```
```
Disables or enables static MDB entry.
```
```
group (ipv4 | ipv6 |
MAC address;
Default: )
```
```
The IPv4, IPv6 or MAC multicast address. Static entries for link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 cannot be
created, as these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs.
```
```
ports (name;
Default: )
```
```

```
```
vid (integer: 1..4094;

```
```
The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created, only applies when vlan-filtering is enabled. When VLAN ID is
not specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply on all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports.
```
For example, to create a static MDB entry for multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:
```
/interface bridge mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=229.10.10.10 ports=ether2,ether3 vid=10
```
Verify the results with the print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge mdb print where group=229.10.10.10
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
# GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE
12 229.10.10.10 10 ether2 bridge1
ether3
```
In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a
static MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group
ff02::2 on all VLANs and ports (modify the ports setting for your particular setup):
```
/interface bridge mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=ff02::2 ports=bridge1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5

Bridge Hardware Offloading
It is possible to switch multiple ports together if a device has a built-in switch chip. While a bridge is a software feature that will consume CPU's
resources, the bridge hardware offloading feature will allow you to use the built-in switch chip to forward packets. This allows you to achieve higher
throughput if configured correctly.
In previous versions (prior to RouterOS v6.41) you had to use the master-port property to switch multiple ports together, but in RouterOS v6.41 this
property is replaced with the bridge hardware offloading feature, which allows your to switch ports and use some of the bridge features, for example, S
panning Tree Protocol.
Below is a list of devices and feature that supports hardware offloading (+) or disables hardware offloading (-):

When upgrading from previous versions (before RouterOS v6.41), the old master-port configuration is automatically converted to the new Br
idge Hardware Offloading configuration. When downgrading from newer versions (RouterOS v6.41 and newer) to older versions (before
RouterOS v6.41) the configuration is not converted back, a bridge without hardware offloading will exist instead, in such a case you need to
reconfigure your device to use the old master-port configuration.

Footnotes:
```
The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups. It is possible to correctly snoop DHCP packets only for a single VLAN, but this
requires that these DHCP messages get tagged with the correct VLAN tag using an ACL rule, for example, /interface ethernet
switch acl add dst-l3-port=67-68 ip-protocol=udp mac-protocol=ip new-customer-vid=10 src-ports=switch1-
cpu. DHCP Option 82 will not contain any information regarding VLAN-ID.
The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups.
The HW vlan-filtering and R/M/STP was added in the RouterOS 7.1rc1 (for RTL8367) and 7.1rc5 (for MT7621) versions. The switch does not
support other ether-type 0x88a8 or 0x9100 (only 0x8100 is supported) and no tag-stacking. Using these features will disable HW offload.
The HW offloading will be disabled only for the specific bridge port, not the entire bridge.
Only 802.3ad and balance-xor modes can be HW offloaded. Other bonding modes do not support HW offloading.
Currently, HW offloaded bridge support for the IPQ-PPE switch chip is still a work in progress. We recommend using, the default, non-HW
offloaded bridge (enabled RSTP).
The 802.3ad mode is compatible only with R/M/STP enabled bridge.
```
Bridge Hardware Offloading should be considered as port switching, but with more possible features. By enabling hardware offloading you are
allowing a built-in switch chip to process packets using its switching logic. The diagram below illustrates that switching occurs before any software
related action.
A packet that is received by one of the ports always passes through the switch logic first. Switch logic decides which ports the packet should be going
to (most commonly this decision is made based on the destination MAC address of a packet, but there might be other criteria that might be involved
based on the packet and the configuration). In most cases the packet will not be visible to RouterOS (only statistics will show that a packet has passed
through), this is because the packet was already processed by the switch chip and never reached the CPU.
```
When upgrading from older versions (before RouterOS v6.41), only the master-port configuration is converted. For each master-port a
bridge will be created. VLAN configuration is not converted and should not be changed, check the Basic VLAN switching guide to be sure
how VLAN switching should be configured for your device.
```
Though it is possible in certain situations to allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, this is usually called a packet forwarding to the switch CPU
port (or the bridge interface in bridge VLAN filtering scenario). This allows the CPU to process the packet and lets the CPU to forward the packet.
Passing the packet to the CPU port will give you the opportunity to route packets to different networks, perform traffic control and other software
related packet processing actions. To allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, you need to make certain configuration changes depending on your
needs and on the device you are using (most commonly passing packets to the CPU are required for VLAN filtering setups). Check the manual page
for your specific device:
```
CRS1xx/2xx series switches
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers
non-CRS series switches
```
Example
Port switching with bridge configuration and enabled hardware offloading:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
Make sure that hardware offloading is enabled and active by checking the "H" flag:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW PVID PRIORITY PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST HORIZON
0 H ether2 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
1 H ether3 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
2 H ether4 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
3 H ether5 bridge1 yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
```
Bridge VLAN Filtering
Bridge VLAN Filtering provides VLAN-aware Layer 2 forwarding and VLAN tag modifications within the bridge. This set of features makes bridge
operation more similar to a traditional Ethernet switch and allows overcoming Spanning Tree compatibility issues compared to the configuration when
VLAN interfaces are bridged. Bridge VLAN Filtering configuration is highly recommended to comply with STP (IEEE 802.1D), RSTP (IEEE 802.1W)
standards and is mandatory to enable MSTP (IEEE 802.1s) support in RouterOS.
The main VLAN setting is vlan-filtering which globally controls VLAN-awareness and VLAN tag processing in the bridge. If vlan-
filtering=no is configured, the bridge ignores VLAN tags, works in a shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) mode, and cannot modify VLAN tags of packets.
Turning on vlan-filtering enables all bridge VLAN related functionality and independent-VLAN-learning (IVL) mode. Besides joining the ports for
Layer2 forwarding, the bridge itself is also an interface therefore it has Port VLAN ID (pvid).
```
Certain bridge and Ethernet port properties are directly related to switch chip settings. Changing such properties can trigger a switch chip
reset, temporarily disabling all Ethernet ports that are on the switch chip for the settings to take effect. This must be taken into account
whenever changing properties in production environments. Such properties include DHCP Snooping, IGMP Snooping, VLAN filtering,
L2MTU, Flow Control, and others. The exact settings that can trigger a switch chip reset depend on the device's model.
```
```
The CRS1xx/2xx series switches support multiple hardware offloaded bridges per switch chip. All other devices support only one hardware
offloaded bridge per switch chip. Use the hw=yes/no parameter to select which bridge will use hardware offloading.
```
```
Port switching in RouterOS v6.41 and newer is done using the bridge configuration. Prior to RouterOS v6.41 port switching was done using
the master-port property.
```
Bridge VLAN table
Bridge VLAN table represents per-VLAN port mapping with an egress VLAN tag action. The tagged ports send out frames with a corresponding
VLAN ID tag. The untagged ports remove a VLAN tag before sending out frames. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all or admit-
only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge vlan
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (name; Default: n
one)
```
```
The bridge interface which the respective VLAN entry is intended for.
```
```
disabled (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables or disables Bridge VLAN entry.
```
```
tagged (interfaces;
Default: none)
```
```
Interfaces or interface list with a VLAN tag adding action in egress. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g. ta
gged=ether1,ether2.
```
```
untagged (interfaces;
Default: none)
```
```
Interfaces or interface list with a VLAN tag removing action in egress. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g.
untagged=ether3,ether4.
```
```
vlan-ids (integer 1..4094
; Default:  1 )
```
```
The list of VLAN IDs for certain port configuration. This setting accepts the VLAN ID range as well as comma-separated
values. e.g. vlan-ids=100-115,120,122,128-130.
```
Bridge port settings
Each bridge port have multiple VLAN related settings, that can change untagged VLAN membership, VLAN tagging/untagging behavior and packet
filtering based on VLAN tag presence.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge port
```
Property Description
```
```
Currently, CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CCR2216 routers and RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190, MT7621 and
MT7531 switch chips (since RouterOS v7) are capable of using bridge VLAN filtering and hardware offloading at the same time, other
devices will not be able to use the benefits of a built-in switch chip when bridge VLAN filtering is enabled. Other devices should be
configured according to the method described in the Basic VLAN switching guide. If an improper configuration method is used, your device
can cause throughput issues in your network.
```
```
The vlan-ids parameter can be used to specify a set or range of VLANs, but specifying multiple VLANs in a single bridge VLAN table
entry should only be used for ports that are tagged ports. In case multiple VLANs are specified for access ports, then tagged packets might
get sent out as untagged packets through the wrong access port, regardless of the PVID value.
```
```
Make sure you have added all needed interfaces to the bridge VLAN table when using bridge VLAN filtering. For routing functions to work
properly on the same device through ports that use bridge VLAN filtering, you will need to allow access to the bridge interface (this
automatically include a switch-cpu port when HW offloaded vlan-filtering is used, e.g. on CRS3xx series switches), this can be done by
adding the bridge interface itself to the VLAN table, for tagged traffic you will need to add the bridge interface as a tagged port and create a
VLAN interface on the bridge interface. Examples can be found in the inter-VLAN routing and Management port sections.
```
```
When allowing access to the CPU, you are allowing access from a certain port to the actual router/switch, this is not always desirable.
Make sure you implement proper firewall filter rules to secure your device when access to the CPU is allowed from a certain VLAN ID and
port, use firewall filter rules to allow access to only certain services.
```
```
Improperly configured bridge VLAN filtering can cause security issues, make sure you fully understand how Bridge VLAN table works
before deploying your device into production environments.
```
```
frame-types (admit-all | admit-
only-untagged-and-priority-
tagged | admit-only-vlan-tagged;
Default: admit-all)
```
```
Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when vlan-filtering
is set to yes.
```
```
ingress-filtering (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN
ID in the bridge VLAN table. Should be used with frame-types to specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged
or untagged. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes. The setting is enabled by
default since RouterOS v7.
```
```
pvid (integer 1..4094; Default:  1 ) Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an
effect when vlan-filtering is set to yes.
```
```
tag-stacking (yes | no; Default: no
)
```
```
Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN
tag regardless if a VLAN tag already exists, packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches the pvid value
and will use EtherType that is specified in ether-type. This property only has effect when vlan-filtering i
s set to yes.
```
Bridge host table
Bridge host table allows monitoring learned MAC addresses. When vlan-filtering is enabled, it shows learned VLAN ID as well (enabled
independent-VLAN-learning or IVL).
```

```
VLAN Example - Trunk and Access Ports
Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the device before VLANs are completely configured. If you need a
management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```
Add bridge ports and specify pvid for access ports to assign their untagged traffic to the intended VLAN. Use frame-types setting to accept only
tagged or untagged packets.
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```
Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-only-untagged-and-priority-
tagged will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=400
```
In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering.
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
VLAN Example - Trunk and Hybrid Ports
Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured. If you need a
management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```
Add bridge ports and specify pvid on hybrid VLAN ports to assign untagged traffic to the intended VLAN.  Use frame-types setting to accept only
tagged packets on ether2.
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400
```
Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example egress VLAN tagging is done on ether6,ether7,ether8 ports too, making
them into hybrid ports. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all will be automatically added as untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether7,ether8 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether8 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,ether6,ether7 vlan-ids=400
```
In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering.
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
VLAN Example - InterVLAN Routing by Bridge
Create a bridge with disabled vlan-filtering to avoid losing access to the router before VLANs are completely configured.  If you need a
management access to the bridge, see the Management access configuration section.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```
Add bridge ports and specify pvid for VLAN access ports to assign their untagged traffic to the intended VLAN. Use frame-types setting to accept
only untagged packets.
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 pvid=200 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 pvid=300 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 pvid=400 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```
Add Bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged ports in them. In this example bridge1 interface is the VLAN trunk that will send traffic further to do
InterVLAN routing. Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as
untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.
```
You don't have to add access ports as untagged ports, because they will be added dynamically as an untagged port with the VLAN ID that
is specified in pvid, you can specify just the trunk port as a tagged port. All ports that have the same pvid set will be added as untagged
ports in a single entry. You must take into account that the bridge itself is a port and it also has a pvid value, this means that the bridge
port also will be added as an untagged port for the ports that have the same pvid. You can circumvent this behavior by either setting
different pvid on all ports (even the trunk port and bridge itself), or to use frame-type set to accept-only-vlan-tagged.
```
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 vlan-ids=400
```
Configure VLAN interfaces on the bridge1 to allow handling of tagged VLAN traffic at routing level and set IP addresses to ensure routing between
VLANs as planned.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN200 vlan-id=200
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN300 vlan-id=300
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN400 vlan-id=400
```
```
/ip address
add address=20.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN200
add address=30.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN300
add address=40.0.0.1/24 interface=VLAN400
```
In the end, when VLAN configuration is complete, enable Bridge VLAN Filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface in order to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1).
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using the L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details on L3 Hardware Offloading.
Management access configuration
There are multiple ways to set up management access on a device that uses bridge VLAN filtering. Below are some of the most popular approaches
to properly enable access to a router/switch. Start by creating a bridge without VLAN filtering enabled:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```
Untagged access without VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the only requirement is to create an IP address on the bridge
interface.
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
Tagged access without VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with tagged traffic is desired, create a routable VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address
on the VLAN interface.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
Tagged access with VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering is used and access with tagged traffic is desired, additional steps are required. In this example, VLAN 99 will be used to access
the device. A VLAN interface on the bridge must be created and an IP address must be assigned to it.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
For example, if you want to allow access to the device from ports ether3, ether4, sfp-sfpplus1 using tagged VLAN 99 traffic, then you must add this
entry to the VLAN table. Note that the bridge1 interface is also included in the tagged port list:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Untagged access with VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering is used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the VLAN interface must use the same VLAN ID as the untagged port VLAN
ID (pvid). Just like in the previous example, start by creating a VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address for the VLAN.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
For example, untagged ports ether2 and ether3 should be able to communicate with the VLAN 99 interface using untagged traffic. In order to achieve
this, these ports should be configured with the pvid that matches the VLAN ID on management VLAN. Note that the bridge1 interface is a tagged port
member, you can configure additional tagged ports if necessary (see the previous example).
```
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Changing untagged VLAN for the bridge interface
In case VLAN filtering is used, it is possible to change the untagged VLAN ID for the bridge interface using the pvid setting. Note that creating
routable VLAN interfaces and allowing tagged traffic on the bridge is a more flexible and generally recommended option.
First, create an IP address on the bridge interface.
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
For example, untagged bridge1 traffic should be able to communicate with untagged ether2 and ether3 ports and tagged sfp-sfpplus1 port in VLAN 99.
In order to achieve this, bridge1, ether2, ether3 should be configured with the same pvid and sfp-sfpplus1 added as a tagged member.
```
/interface bridge
set [find name=bridge1] pvid=99
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=bridge1,ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
VLAN Tunneling (QinQ)
Since RouterOS v6.43 the RouterOS bridge is IEEE 802.1ad compliant and it is possible to filter VLAN IDs based on Service VLAN ID (0x88a8) rather
than Customer VLAN ID (0x8100). The same principles can be applied as with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN filtering (the same setup examples can be used).
Below is a topology for a common Provider bridge:
In this example, R1, R2, R3, and R4 might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic by 802.1Q (CVID), but SW1 and SW2 needs isolate traffic between
routers in a way that R1 is able to communicate only with R3, and R2 is only able to communicate with R4. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic
with an SVID and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by enabling the service tag 0x88a8, introduced by 802.1ad, on the bridge. Use
these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x88a8
```
In this setup, ether1 and ether2 are going to be access ports (untagged), use the pvid parameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port, use these
commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```
Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
If the connection to the router/switch through an IP address is not required, then steps adding an IP address can be skipped since a
connection to the router/switch through Layer2 protocols (e.g. MAC-telnet) will be working either way.
```
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```
When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
Tag stacking
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to forcefully add a new VLAN tag over any existing VLAN tags, this feature can be used to achieve a CVID
stacking setup, where a CVID (0x8100) tag is added before an existing CVID tag. This type of setup is very similar to the Provider bridge setup, to
achieve the same setup but with multiple CVID tags (CVID stacking) we can use the same topology:
In this example R1, R2, R3, and R4 might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic, it can be 802.1ad, 802.1Q or any other type of traffic, but SW1 and SW2
needs isolate traffic between routers in a way that R1 is able to communicate only with R3, and R2 is only able to communicate with R4. To do so,
you can tag all ingress traffic with a new CVID tag and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by selecting the proper EtherType, use these
commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
```
Note, that if you are using the new EtherType/TPID 0x88a8 (service tag) and you also need a VLAN interface for your Service VLAN, you
will also have to apply the use-service-tag parameter on the VLAN interface.
```
```
When ether-type=0x8100 is configured, the bridge checks the outer VLAN tag and sees if it is using EtherType 0x8100. If the bridge
receives a packet with an outer tag that has a different EtherType, it will mark the packet as untagged. Since RouterOS only checks the
outer tag of a packet, it is not possible to filter 802.1Q packets when the 802.1ad protocol is used.
```
```
Currently, only CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers are capable of hardware offloaded VLAN filtering using
the Service tag, EtherType/TPID 0x88a8.
```
```
Devices with switch chip Marvell-98DX3257 (e.g. CRS354 series) do not support VLAN filtering on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for other
VLAN types (0x88a8 and 0x9100).
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x8100
```
In this setup, ether1 and ether2 will ignore any VLAN tags that are present and add a new VLAN tag, use the pvid parameter to tag all ingress traffic
on each port and allow tag-stacking on these ports, use these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```
Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, you only need to specify the VLAN ID of the outer tag, use these commands on SW1 and
SW2:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```
When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, which is required in order for the pvid parameter to have any effect,
use these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
MVRP
Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (MVRP) is a protocol based on Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) which allows to register attributes (VLAN IDs
in case of MVRP) with other members of Bridged LAN.
An MRP application can make or withdraw declarations of attributes which result in registration or leaving of those attributes with other MRP
participants.
Here's how it works.
MRP consists of two parts:
```
Applicant - responsible for sending declarations (or leaves). Its behavior can be configured on a per-port basis using the setting called mvrp-
applicant-state, and per-VLAN using the mvrp-forbidden setting.
Registrar - responsible for registering incoming declarations. Its configuration can be set per-port using the mvrp-registrar-state
setting, and per-VLAN using the mvrp-forbidden setting.
```
Registration Propagation: Incoming registration on a bridge port dynamically makes that specific port a tagged VLAN member. Additionally, the
attributes associated with this registration are spread to all active (forwarding) bridge ports as a declaration.
Declaration Operation: In case of MVRP, the configured VLAN's get declared on each port, but they will only get configured as members of those
VLAN's when a declaration is received from the LAN (Registrar will register the VLAN). From the perspective of an end-station, a single declaration
will be registered on each upstream port across the entire LAN. When another end-station declares the same attribute, a path of registrations will be
made between the two (or more) end stations, see the picture below.
MVRP helps to dynamically propagate VLAN information throughout the bridged network and configure VLANs only on the needed ports. This makes
the network efficient by avoiding unnecessary traffic flooding.
As noted before, MVRP is only active on ports that are forwarding. In case of MSTP declarations and registrations are made only if the port is
forwarding in the MSTI in which VLAN is mapped.
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
The point-to-point ports speed up the process of registration (or leaving). Manually configuring point-to-point=yes can be advantageous for non-
Ethernet interfaces.

Sub-menu: /interface bridge vlan
All ports that are members of static VLANs or dynamic untagged VLANs created by the port pvid setting are treated as "fixed." Meaning the registrar
disregards all MRP messages and remains registered (IN) for those VLANs.
When VLAN is neither manually configured nor created by the port pvid setting, incoming registrations on a bridge port can dynamically designate
that specific port as a tagged VLAN member. The mvrp-forbidden feature allows creating a list of ports that are restricted from registering into a
specific VLAN ID.
VLANs that are static or dynamic will be declared by the applicants unless this functionality is disabled by the port's mvrp-applicant-state, or by
VLAN's mvrp-forbidden setting.
```

Fast Forward
Fast Forward allows forwarding packets faster under special conditions. When Fast Forward is enabled, then the bridge can process packets even
faster since it can skip multiple bridge-related checks, including MAC learning. Below you can find a list of conditions that MUST be met in order for
Fast Forward to be active:
```
Bridge has fast-forward set to yes
Bridge has only 2 running ports
Both bridge ports support Fast Path, Fast Path is active on ports and globally on the bridge
Bridge Hardware Offloading is disabled
Bridge VLAN Filtering is disabled
Bridge DHCP snooping is disabled
unknown-multicast-flood is set to yes
unknown-unicast-flood is set to yes
broadcast-flood is set to yes
MAC address for the bridge matches with a MAC address from one of the bridge slave ports
horizon for both ports is set to none
```
It is possible to check how many packets where processed by Fast Forward:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge settings> pr
use-ip-firewall: no
use-ip-firewall-for-vlan: no
use-ip-firewall-for-pppoe: no
allow-fast-path: yes
bridge-fast-path-active: yes
bridge-fast-path-packets: 0
bridge-fast-path-bytes: 0
bridge-fast-forward-packets: 16423
bridge-fast-forward-bytes: 24864422
```
```
Fast Forward disables MAC learning, this is by design to achieve faster packet forwarding. MAC learning prevents traffic from flooding
multiple interfaces, but MAC learning is not needed when a packet can only be sent out through just one interface.
```
```
Fast Forward is disabled when hardware offloading is enabled. Hardware offloading can achieve full write-speed performance when it is
active since it will use the built-in switch chip (if such exists on your device), fast forward uses the CPU to forward packets. When
comparing throughput results, you would get such results: Hardware offloading > Fast Forward > Fast Path > Slow Path.
```
Since RouterOS 6.44 it is possible to monitor Fast Forward status, for example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge monitor bridge1
state: enabled
current-mac-address: B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7
root-bridge: yes
root-bridge-id: 0x8000.B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7
root-path-cost: 0
root-port: none
port-count: 2
designated-port-count: 2
fast-forward: yes
```
IGMP/MLD Snooping
The bridge supports IGMP/MLD snooping. It controls multicast streams and prevents multicast flooding on unnecessary ports. Its settings are placed
in the bridge menu and it works independently in every bridge interface. Software-driven implementation works on all devices with RouterOS, but
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CR2216 routers, and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips also support IGMP/MLD snooping
with hardware offloading. See more details on IGMP/MLD snooping manual.
DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82
DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82 is supported by bridge. The DHCP Snooping is a Layer2 security feature, that limits unauthorized DHCP
servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where known DHCP server
resides and DHCP messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCP server messages will be
dropped). The DHCP Option 82 is additional information (Agent Circuit ID and Agent Remote ID) provided by DHCP Snooping enabled devices that
allow identifying the device itself and DHCP clients.
```
If packets are processed by Fast Path, then Fast Forward is not active. Packet count can be used as an indicator of whether Fast Forward
is active or not.
```
```
Disabling or enabling fast-forward will temporarily disable all bridge ports for settings to take effect. This must be taken into account
whenever changing this property on production environments since it can cause all packets to be temporarily dropped.
```
In this example, SW1 and SW2 are DHCP Snooping, and Option 82 enabled devices. First, we need to create a bridge, assign interfaces and mark
trusted ports. Use these commands on SW1:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
```
For SW2, the configuration will be similar, but we also need to mark ether1 as trusted, because this interface is going to receive DHCP messages with
Option 82 already added. You need to mark all ports as trusted if they are going to receive DHCP messages with added Option 82, otherwise these
messages will be dropped. Also, we add ether3 to the same bridge and leave this port untrusted, imagine there is an unauthorized (rogue) DHCP
server. Use these commands on SW2:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```
Then we need to enable DHCP Snooping and Option 82. In case your DHCP server does not support DHCP Option 82 or you do not implement any
Option 82 related policies, this option can be disabled. Use these commands on SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bridge
set [find where name="bridge"] dhcp-snooping=yes add-dhcp-option82=yes
```
Now both devices will analyze what DHCP messages are received on bridge ports. The SW1 is responsible for adding and removing the DHCP Option
82. The SW2 will limit rogue DHCP server from receiving any discovery messages and drop malicious DHCP server messages from ether3.


# Controller Bridge and Port Extender
Controller Bridge (CB) and Port Extender (PE) is an IEEE 802.1BR standard implementation in RouterOS for CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and
CCR2116, CCR2216 routers. It allows virtually extending the CB ports with a PE device and managing these extended interfaces from a single
controlling device. Such configuration provides a simplified network topology, flexibility, increased port density, and ease of manageability. See more
details on Controller Bridge and Port Extender manual.

## Bridge Firewall
The bridge firewall implements packet filtering and thereby provides security functions that are used to manage data flow to, from, and through the
bridge.
Packet flow diagram shows how packets are processed through the router. It is possible to force bridge traffic to go through /ip firewall filter r
ules (see the bridge settings).
There are two bridge firewall tables:
```
Currently, CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CR2216 routers, and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips fully support
hardware offloaded DHCP Snooping and Option 82. For CRS1xx and CRS2xx series switches it is possible to use DHCP Snooping along
with VLAN switching, but then you need to make sure that DHCP packets are sent out with the correct VLAN tag using egress ACL rules.
Other devices are capable of using DHCP Snooping and Option 82 features along with hardware offloading, but you must make sure that
there is no VLAN-related configuration applied on the device, otherwise, DHCP Snooping and Option 82 might not work properly. See the Br
idge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
Starting from RouterOS v7.17, DHCP snooping is supported with hardware offloading bonding interfaces.
```
```
filter - bridge firewall with three predefined chains:
input - filters packets, where the destination is the bridge (including those packets that will be routed, as they are destined to the
bridge MAC address anyway)
output - filters packets, which come from the bridge (including those packets that has been routed normally)
forward - filters packets, which are to be bridged (note: this chain is not applied to the packets that should be routed through the
router, just to those that are traversing between the ports of the same bridge)
nat - bridge network address translation provides ways for changing source/destination MAC addresses of the packets traversing a bridge.
Has two built-in chains:
srcnat - used for "hiding" a host or a network behind a different MAC address. This chain is applied to the packets leaving the router
through a bridged interface
dstnat - used for redirecting some packets to other destinations
```
You can put packet marks in bridge firewall (filter and NAT), which are the same as the packet marks in IP firewall configured by '/ip firewall
mangle'. In this way, packet marks put by bridge firewall can be used in 'IP firewall', and vice versa.
General bridge firewall properties are described in this section. Some parameters that differ between nat and filter rules are described in further
sections.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge filter, /interface bridge nat

Property Description
```
```
802.3-sap (integer; Default: ) DSAP (Destination Service Access Point) and SSAP (Source Service
Access Point) are 2 one-byte fields, which identify the network
protocol entities which use the link-layer service. These bytes are
always equal. Two hexadecimal digits may be specified here to match
an SAP byte.
```
```
802.3-type (integer; Default: ) Ethernet protocol type, placed after the IEEE 802.2 frame header.

```
Action to take if the packet is matched by the rule:
```
```
accept - accept the packet. The packet is not passed to the next
firewall rule
drop - silently drop the packet
jump - jump to the user-defined chain specified by the value of ju
mp-target parameter
log - add a message to the system log containing the following
data: in-interface, out-interface, src-mac, protocol, src-ip:port-
>dst-ip:port and length of the packet. After the packet is matched
it is passed to the next rule in the list, similar as passthrough
mark-packet - place a mark specified by the new-packet-mark
parameter on a packet that matches the rule
passthrough - if the packet is matched by the rule, increase
counter and go to next rule (useful for statistics)
return - passes control back to the chain from where the jump
took place
set-priority - set priority specified by the new-priority parameter
on the packets sent out through a link that is capable of
transporting priority (VLAN or WMM-enabled wireless interface).

Port switching
In order to set up a port switching, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page.
```
Currently, it is possible to create only one bridge with hardware offloading. Use the hw=yes/no parameter to select which bridge will use
hardware offloading.
```
VLAN
Since RouterOS version 6.41, a bridge provides VLAN aware Layer2 forwarding and VLAN tag modifications within the bridge. This set of features makes
bridge operation more like a traditional Ethernet switch and allows to overcome Spanning Tree compatibility issues compared to the configuration when
tunnel-like VLAN interfaces are bridged. Bridge VLAN Filtering configuration is highly recommended to comply with STP (802.1D), RSTP (802.1w)
standards and it is mandatory to enable MSTP (802.1s) support in RouterOS.
VLAN Filtering
VLAN filtering is described on the Bridge VLAN Filtering section.
VLAN setup examples
Below are describes some of the most common ways how to utilize VLAN forwarding.
Port-Based VLAN
The configuration is described on the Bridge VLAN FIltering section.
MAC Based VLAN
Enable switching on ports by creating a bridge with enabled hw-offloading:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
```
Add VLANs in the Bridge VLAN table and specify ports:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether7 vlan-ids=200,300,400
```
Add Switch rules which assign VLAN id based on MAC address:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add switch=switch1 ports=ether7 src-mac-address=A4:12:6D:77:94:43/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-vlan-id=200
add switch=switch1 ports=ether7 src-mac-address=84:37:62:DF:04:20/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-vlan-id=300
add switch=switch1 ports=ether7 src-mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-vlan-id=400
```
Protocol Based VLAN
```
Bridge STP/RSTP/MSTP, IGMP Snooping and VLAN filtering settings don't affect hardware offloading, since RouterOS v6.42 Bonding
interfaces are also hardware offloaded.
```
```
The Switch Rule table is used for MAC Based VLAN functionality, see this table on how many rules each device supports.
MAC-based VLANs will only work properly between switch ports and not between switch ports and CPU. When a packet is being
forwarded to the CPU, the pvid property for the bridge port will be always used instead of new-vlan-id from ACL rules.
MAC-based VLANs will not work for DHCP packets when DHCP snooping is enabled.
```
Enable switching on ports by creating a bridge with enabled hw-offloading:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Add VLANs in the Bridge VLAN table and specify ports:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether6 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether7 vlan-ids=300
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether8 vlan-ids=400
```
Add Switch rules which assign VLAN id based on MAC protocol:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add mac-protocol=ip new-vlan-id=200 ports=ether6 switch=switch1
add mac-protocol=ipx new-vlan-id=300 ports=ether7 switch=switch1
add mac-protocol=0x80F3 new-vlan-id=400 ports=ether8 switch=switch1
```
VLAN Tunneling (Q-in-Q)
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to use a provider bridge (IEEE 802.1ad) and Tag Stacking VLAN filtering, and hardware offloading at the same time.
The configuration is described in the Bridge VLAN Tunneling (Q-in-Q) section.
Ingress VLAN translation
It is possible to translate a certain VLAN ID to a different VLAN ID using ACL rules on an ingress port. In this example we create two ACL rules, allowing
bidirectional communication. This can be done by doing the following.
Create a new bridge and add ports to it with hardware offloading:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
```
Add ACL rules to translate a VLAN ID in each direction:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add new-dst-ports=ether2 new-vlan-id=20 ports=ether1 switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add new-dst-ports=ether1 new-vlan-id=10 ports=ether2 switch=switch1 vlan-id=20
```
```
The Switch Rule table is used for Protocol Based VLAN functionality, see this table on how many rules each device supports.
Protocol-based VLANs will only work properly between switch ports and not between switch ports and CPU. When a packet is being
forwarded to the CPU, the pvid property for the bridge port will be always used instead of new-vlan-id from ACL rules.
Protocol-based VLANs will not work for DHCP packets when DHCP snooping is enabled.
```
```
Devices with switch chip Marvell-98DX3257 (e.g. CRS354 series) do not support VLAN filtering on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for other VLAN
types (0x88a8 and 0x9100).
```
Add both VLAN IDs to the bridge VLAN table:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
```
Enable bridge VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
(R/M)STP
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers are capable of running STP, RSTP, and MSTP on a hardware level. For more detailed
information you should check out the Spanning Tree Protocol manual page.
Bonding
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers support hardware offloading with bonding interfaces. Only 802.3ad and balance-
xor bonding modes are hardware offloaded, other bonding modes will use the CPU's resources. You can find more information about the bonding
interfaces in the Bonding Interface section. If 802.3ad mode is used, then LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) is supported.
To create a hardware offloaded bonding interface, you must create a bonding interface with a supported bonding mode:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2
```
This interface can be added to a bridge alongside other interfaces:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=bond1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether4 hw=yes
```
Make sure that the bonding interface is hardware offloaded by checking the "H" flag:
```
/interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW
0 H bond1 bridge yes
1 H ether3 bridge yes
2 H ether4 bridge yes
```
```
Bidirectional communication is limited only between two switch ports. Translating VLAN ID between more ports can cause traffic flooding or
incorrect forwarding between the same VLAN ports.
```
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
```
Do not add interfaces to a bridge that are already in a bond, RouterOS will not allow you to add an interface to bridge that is already a slave port
for bonding.
```
Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group
MLAG (Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group) implementation in RouterOS allows configuring LACP bonds on two separate devices, while the client
device believes to be connected on the same machine. This provides a physical redundancy in case of switch failure. All CRS3xx, CRS5xx series and
CCR2116, CCR2216 devices can be configured with MLAG. Read here for more information.
L3 Hardware Offloading
Layer3 hardware offloading (otherwise known as IP switching or HW routing) will allow to offload some of the router features onto the switch chip. This
allows reaching wire speeds when routing packets, which simply would not be possible with the CPU.
Offloaded feature set depends on the used chipset. Read here for more info.
Port isolation
Since RouterOS v6.43 is it possible to create a Private VLAN setup, an example can be found in the Switch chip port isolation manual page. Hardware
offloaded bonding interfaces are not included in the switch port-isolation menu, but it is still possible to configure port-isolation individually on each
secondary interface of the bonding.
IGMP/MLD Snooping
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers are capable of using IGMP/MLD Snooping on a hardware level. To see more detailed
information, you should check out the IGMP/MLD snooping manual page.
DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers are capable of using DHCP Snooping with Option 82 on a hardware level. The switch
will create a dynamic ACL rule to capture the DHCP packets and redirect them to the main CPU for further processing. To see more detailed information,
please visit the DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82 manual page.
Controller Bridge and Port Extender
Controller Bridge (CB) and Port Extender (PE) is an IEEE 802.1BR standard implementation in RouterOS. It allows virtually extending the CB ports with a
PE device and managing these extended interfaces from a single controlling device. Such configuration provides a simplified network topology, flexibility,
increased port density, and ease of manageability. See more details on Controller Bridge and Port Extender manual.
Mirroring
```
With HW-offloaded bonding interfaces, the built-in switch chip will always use Layer2+Layer3+Layer4 for a transmit hash policy, changing the
transmit hash policy manually will have no effect.
```
```
Port isolation can be used with vlan-filtering bridge and it is possible to isolate ports that are members of the same VLAN. The isolation works
per-port, it is not possible to isolate ports per-VLAN.
```
```
Starting from RouterOS v7.17, DHCP snooping is supported with hardware offloading bonding interfaces.
```
Mirroring is a function that allows a network switch to duplicate all the data passing through it and send a copy to another specified port, known as the mirr
or-target. This feature is useful for setting up a tap device, which allows for analyzing network traffic using a separate device. You can set up mirroring
in a simple way by designating source ports (see mirror-egress and mirror-ingress in /interface/ethernet/switch/port), or you can
configure more advanced mirroring based on different criteria (see mirror in /interface/ethernet/switch/rule).
It is important to note that the mirror-target port must be on the same switch. You can check the device block diagram or navigate to the /interface
/ethernet menu to identify which interfaces are connected where. When setting up the configration, it is not mandatory to add the mirror-target
interface to the same hardware offloaded bridge where the source ports are set up. The mirror-target port can be a standalone interface (not
configured as a bridge port), or it can be within a bridge setup. When using the mirror-target with a bridge, note that data and mirrored traffic may
both travel on the same LAN. In such cases, consider employing RSPAN (Remote Switch Port Analyzer), where mirrored traffic is encapsulated into a
separate VLAN before being transmitted over the network.
Additionally, you can set the mirror-target port to a special value "cpu", which means that the copied packets will be sent to the switch chip's CPU port.
Configuration examples
Port Based Mirroring
Starting from RouterOS version 7.15, it is possible to configure multiple source ports and selectively choose whether to mirror incoming traffic, outgoing
traffic, or both. In this example, both incoming and outgoing traffic from the ether2 interface will be copied and sent to the ether3 interface for monitoring or
analysis.
```
# Since RouterOS v7.15
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 mirror-egress=yes mirror-ingress=yes
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-target=ether3
```
```
# Older RouterOS:
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-source=ether2 mirror-target=ether3
```
VLAN Based Mirroring
Using ACL rules, it is possible to mirror packets from multiple interfaces using the ports setting. Additionally, you can specify more detailed criteria such
as VLAN ID, MAC/IP address or TCP/UDP port. Only ingress packets are mirrored to mirror-target interface. This example will mirror incoming VLAN
11 traffic from the ether2 interface, and send copies to the ether3 interface. To use an ACL rule with a vlan-id matcher, you need to have bridge vlan-
filtering enabled.
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-target=ether3
/interface ethernet switch rule
add mirror=yes ports=ether1 switch=switch1 vlan-id=11
```
MAC Based Mirroring
This example will mirror incoming traffic with 64:D1:54:D9:27:E6 MAC destination or source address from the ether1 interface, and send copies to the ether3
interface.
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-target=ether3
/interface ethernet switch rule
add mirror=yes ports=ether1 switch=switch1 dst-mac-address=64:D1:54:D9:27:E6/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
add mirror=yes ports=ether1 switch=switch1 src-mac-address=64:D1:54:D9:27:E6/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
```
IP Based Mirroring
This example will mirror incoming traffic with 192.168.88.0/24 IP destination or source address from the ether1 interface, and send copies to the ether3
interface.
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-target=ether3 mirror-source=none
/interface ethernet switch rule
add mirror=yes ports=ether1 switch=switch1 src-address=192.168.88.0/24
add mirror=yes ports=ether1 switch=switch1 dst-address=192.168.88.0/24
```
There are other options as well, check the ACL section to find out all possible parameters that can be used to match packets.
Remote Switch Port Analyzer
This example will mirror incomming and outgoing traffic from the ether2 interface, copies will be encapsulated in 802.1Q VLAN using the 999 as VLAN ID,
and packets will be sent to the ether3 interface. If the original traffic is already VLAN tagged, RSPAN will add another layer of VLAN tagging as an outer
tag. This results in the mirrored traffic being tagged twice. If the mirror-target port is included in vlan-filtering bridge, it is not required to make the
interface as tagged VLAN member under the /interface/bridge/vlan menu for the RSPAN.
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 mirror-egress=yes mirror-ingress=yes
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-target=ether3 rspan=yes rspan-egress-vlan-id=999 rspan-ingress-vlan-id=999
```
Property Reference

```
Traffic Shaping
It is possible to limit ingress traffic that matches certain parameters with ACL rules and it is possible to limit ingress/egress traffic per port basis. The policer
is used for ingress traffic, the shaper is used for egress traffic. The ingress policer controls the received traffic with packet drops. Everything that exceeds
the defined limit will get dropped. This can affect the TCP congestion control mechanism on end hosts and achieved bandwidth can be actually less than
defined. The egress shaper tries to queue packets that exceed the limit instead of dropping them. Eventually, it will also drop packets when the output
queue gets full, however, it should allow utilizing the defined throughput better.
Port-based traffic police and shaper:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 ingress-rate=10M egress-rate=5M
```
MAC-based traffic policer:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 src-mac-address=64:D1:54:D9:27:E6/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF rate=10M
```
VLAN-based traffic policer:
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 vlan-id=11 rate=10M
```
Protocol-based traffic policer:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 mac-protocol=ipx rate=10M
```
There are other options as well, check the ACL section to find out all possible parameters that can be used to match packets.
Traffic Storm Control
Since RouterOS v6.42 it is possible to enable traffic storm control. A traffic storm can emerge when certain frames are continuously flooded on the
network. Storm control settings is generally configured on non-uplink ports to restrict incoming storm traffic on those specific ports. This helps safeguard
the entire switch and its connected ports by minimizing the impact of traffic storms across the network.
For example, if a network loop has been created and no loop avoidance mechanisms are used (e.g. Spanning Tree Protocol), broadcast or multicast
frames can quickly overwhelm the network, causing degraded network performance or even complete network breakdown. With CRS3xx, CRS5xx series
switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers it is possible to limit broadcast, unknown multicast and unknown unicast traffic. Unknown unicast traffic is
considered when a switch does not contain a host entry for the destined MAC address. Unknown multicast traffic is considered when a switch does not
contain a multicast group entry in the /interface bridge mdb menu. Storm control settings should be applied to ingress ports, the egress traffic will be
limited.
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
```
The Switch Rule table is used for QoS functionality, see this table on how many rules each device supports.
```
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch port
```
Property Description
```
```
limit-broadcasts (yes | no; Default: yes) Limit broadcast traffic on a switch port.
```
```
limit-unknown-multicasts (yes | no; Default:
no)
```
```
Limit unknown multicast traffic on a switch port.
```
```
limit-unknown-unicasts (yes | no; Default: no
)
```
```
Limit unknown unicast traffic on a switch port.
```
```
storm-rate (integer 0..100; Default:  100 ) Amount of broadcast, unknown multicast and/or unknown unicast traffic is limited to in percentage of the
link speed.
```
For example, to limit 1% (10Mbps) of broadcast and unknown unicast traffic on ether1 (1Gbps), use the following commands:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 storm-rate=1 limit-broadcasts=yes limit-unknown-unicasts=yes
```
MPLS hardware offloading
Since RouterOS v6.41 it is possible to offload certain MPLS functions to the switch chip, the switch must be a (P)rovider router in a PE-P-PE setup in order
to achieve hardware offloading. A setup example can be found in the Basic MPLS setup example manual page. The hardware offloading will only take
place when LDP interfaces are configured as physical switch interfaces (e.g. Ethernet, SFP, SFP+).
```
The storm control parameter is specified in percentage (%) of the link speed. If your link speed is 1Gbps, then specifying storm-rate as  10  will
allow only 100Mbps of broadcast, unknown multicast and/or unknown unicast traffic to be forwarded.
```
```
Devices with Marvell-98DX3236 switch chip cannot distinguish unknown multicast traffic from all multicast traffic. For example, CRS326-24G-
2S+ will limit all multicast traffic when limit-unknown-multicasts and storm-rate is used. For other devices, for example, CRS317-1G-
16S+ the limit-unknown-multicasts parameter will limit only unknown multicast traffic (addresses that are not present in /interface
bridge mdb).
```
```
Currently only CRS317-1G-16S+ and CRS309-1G-8S+ using RouterOS v6.41 and newer are capable of hardware offloading certain MPLS
functions. CRS317-1G-16S+ and CRS309-1G-8S+ built-in switch chip is not capable of popping MPLS labels from packets, in a PE-P-PE
setup you either have to use explicit null or disable TTL propagation in MPLS network to achieve hardware offloading.
```
Switch Rules (ACL)
Access Control List contains ingress policy and egress policy engines. See this table on how many rules each device supports. It is an advanced tool for
wire-speed packet filtering, forwarding and modifying based on Layer2, Layer3 and Layer4 protocol header field conditions.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch rule
```
Property Description
```
```
copy-to-cpu (no | yes; Default: no) Clones the matching packet and sends it to the CPU.
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Enables or disables ACL entry.
```
```
dscp (0..63) Matching the DSCP field of the packet (only applies to IPv4 packets).
```
```
dst-address (IP address/Mask) Matching destination IPv4 address and mask, also matches the
destination IP in ARP packets.
```
```
dst-address6 (IPv6 address/Mask) Matching destination IPv6 address and mask.
```
```
dst-mac-address (MAC address/Mask) Matching destination MAC address and mask.
```
```
dst-port (0..65535) Matching destination protocol port number (applies to IPv4 and IPv6
packets if mac-protocol is not specified).
```
```
flow-label (0..1048575) Matching IPv6 flow label.
```
```
mac-protocol (802.2 | arp | capsman | dot1x | homeplug-av | ip | ipv6 | ipx |
lacp | lldp | loop-protect | macsec | mpls-multicast | mpls-unicast | packing-

```
```
Matching particular MAC protocol specified by protocol name or
number
```
```
mirror (no | yes) Clones the matching packet and sends it to the mirror-target port.
```
```
new-dst-ports (ports | bond | all) Changes the destination port to the specified value:
```
```
If the setting is left empty (e.g. new-dst-ports=""), the packet
will be dropped;
If a port or  hardware-offloaded bonding interface is specified, the
packet will be redirected to that port. Only single port or bond
interface is supported;
if you use the all argument, packet will be allowed to pass
through to the egress processing without being dropped;
If this parameter is not used, the packet will be accepted as is.
```
```
The MPLS hardware offloading has been removed since RouterOS v7.
```
```
ACL rules are checked for each received packet until a match has been found. If there are multiple rules that can match, then only the first rule
will be triggered. A rule without any action parameters is a rule to accept the packet.
```
```
It is not required to set mac-protocol to certain IP version when using L3 or L4 matchers, however, it is recommended to set the mac-
protocol=ip or mac-protocol=ipv6  when filtering any IP packets.
```
```
When switch ACL rules are modified (e.g. added, removed, disabled, enabled, or moved), the existing switch rules will be inactive for a short
time. This can cause some packet leakage during the ACL rule modifications.

Port Security
It is possible to limit allowed MAC addresses on a single switch port. For example, to allow 64:D1:54:81:EF:8E MAC address on a switch port, start by
switching multiple ports together, in this example 64:D1:54:81:EF:8E is going to be located behind ether1.
Create an ACL rule to allow the given MAC address and drop all other traffic on ether1 (for ingress traffic):
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 src-mac-address=64:D1:54:81:EF:8E/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF switch=switch1
add new-dst-ports="" ports=ether1 switch=switch1
```
Switch all required ports together, disable MAC learning and disable unknown unicast flooding on ether1:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes learn=no unknown-unicast-flood=no
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
```
Add a static hosts entry for 64:D1:54:81:EF:8E (for egress traffic):
```
/interface bridge host
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 mac-address=64:D1:54:81:EF:8E
```
Dual Boot
The “dual boot” feature allows you to choose which operating system you prefer to use on CRS3xx series switches, RouterOS or SwOS. Device operating
system could be changed using:
```
Command-line (/system routerboard settings set boot-os=swos)
Winbox
Webfig
Serial Console
```
More details about SwOS are described here: SwOS manual
```
For VLAN related matchers or VLAN related action parameters to work, you need to enable vlan-filtering on the bridge interface and
make sure that hardware offloading is enabled on those ports, otherwise, these parameters will not have any effect.
```
```
When bridge interface ether-type is set to 0x8100, then VLAN related ACL rules are relevant to frames tagged using regular/customer VLAN
(TPID 0x8100), this includes vlan-id and new-vlan-id. When bridge interface ether-type is set to 0x88a8, then ACL rules are relevant
to frames tagged with 802.1ad service tag (TPID 0x88a8).
```
```
Broadcast traffic will still be sent out from ether1. To limit broadcast traffic flood on a bridge port, you can use the broadcast-flood parameter
to toggle it. Do note that some protocols depend on broadcast traffic, such as streaming protocols and DHCP.
```
Configuring SwOS using RouterOS
Since RouterOS 6.43 it is possible to load, save and reset SwOS configuration, as well as upgrade SwOS and set an IP address for the CRS3xx series
switches by using RouterOS.
```
Save configuration with /system swos save-config
```
```
Load configuration with /system swos load-config
Change password with /system swos password
Reset configuration with /system swos reset-config
Upgrade SwOS from RouterOS using /system swos upgrade
```
```
Property Description
```
```
address-acquisition-mode (d
hcp-only | dhcp-with-fallback
| static; Default: dhcp-with-
fallback)
```
```
Changes address acquisition method:
dhcp-only - uses only a DHCP client to acquire address
```
```
dhcp-with-fallback - for the first 10 seconds will try to acquire address using a DHCP client. If the request is
unsuccessful, then address falls back to static as defined by static-ip-address property
```
```
static - address is set as defined by static-ip-address property
```
```
allow-from (IP/Mask; Default:
0.0.0.0/0)
```
```
IP address or a network from which the switch is accessible. By default, the switch is accessible by any IP address.
```
```
allow-from-ports (name;
Default: )
```
```
List of switch ports from which the device is accessible. By default, all ports are allowed to access the switch
```
```
allow-from-vlan (integer: 0..
4094 ; Default:  0 )
```
```
VLAN ID from which the device is accessible. By default, all VLANs are allowed
```
```
identity (name; Default: Mikr
otik)
```
```
Name of the switch (used for Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery protocol)
```
```
static-ip-address (IP; Default:
192.168.88.1)
```
```
IP address of the switch in case address-acquisition-mode is either set to dhcp-with-fallback or static. By setting a static
IP address, the address acquisition process does not change, which is DHCP with fallback by default. This means that
the configured static IP address will become active only when there is going to be no DHCP servers in the same
broadcast domain

Port Switching
To set up port switching on CRS1xx/2xx series switches, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page.
Multiple switch groups
The CRS1xx/2xx series switches allow you to use multiple bridges with hardware offloading, this allows you to easily isolate multiple switch groups. This
can be done by simply creating multiple bridges and enabling hardware offloading.
Global Settings
```
Dynamic reserved VLAN entries (VLAN4091; VLAN4090; VLAN4089; etc.) are created in the CRS switch when switched port groups are added
when a hardware offloaded bridge is created. These VLANs are necessary for internal operation and have lower precedence than user-
configured VLANs.
```
```
Multiple hardware offloaded bridge configuration is designed as a fast and simple port isolation solution, but it limits a part of the VLAN
functionality supported by the CRS switch chip. For advanced configurations use one bridge within the CRS switch chip for all ports, configure
VLANs, and isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration.
```
```
CRS1xx/2xx series switches can run multiple hardware offloaded bridges with (R)STP enabled, but it is not recommended since the device is
not designed to run multiple (R)STP instances on a hardware level. To isolate multiple switch groups and have (R)STP enabled you should
isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration.
```
The CRS switch chip is configurable from the /interface ethernet switch console menu.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch
```
Property Description
```

mer-vid-used-
as-lookup-vid)
```
```
The bridge type defines which VLAN tag is used as Lookup-VID. Lookup-VID serves as the VLAN key for all VLAN-based lookups.
```
```
mac-level-
isolation (yes
| no; Default:
yes)
```
```
Globally enables or disables MAC level isolation. Once enabled, the switch will check the source and destination MAC address
entries and their isolation-profile from the unicast forwarding table. By default, the switch will learn MAC addresses and place
them into a promiscuous isolation profile. Other isolation profiles can be used when creating static unicast entries. If the source or
destination MAC address is located on a promiscuous isolation profile, the packet is forwarded. If both source and destination
MAC addresses are located on the same community1 or community2 isolation profile, the packet is forwarded. The packet is
dropped when the source and destination MAC address isolation profile is isolated, or when the source and destination MAC
address isolation profiles are from different communities (e.g. source MAC address is community1 and destination MAC address is
community2). When MAC level isolation is globally disabled, the isolation is bypassed.

Port Isolation/Leakage
The CRS switches support flexible multi-level isolation features, which can be used for user access control, traffic engineering and advanced security and
network management. The isolation features provide an organized fabric structure allowing user to easily program and control the access by port, MAC
address, VLAN, protocol, flow, and frame type. The following isolation and leakage features are supported:
```
Port-level isolation
MAC-level isolation
VLAN-level isolation
Protocol-level isolation
Flow-level isolation
Free combination of the above
```
Port-level isolation supports different control schemes on the source port and destination port. Each entry can be programmed with access control for
either the source port or the destination port.
```
When the entry is programmed with source port access control, the entry is
```
applied to the ingress packets.
```
When the entry is programmed with destination port access control, the entry
```
is applied to the egress packets.
Port leakage allows bypassing egress VLAN filtering on the port. A leaky port is allowed to access other ports for various applications such as security,
network control, and management. Note: When both isolation and leakage are applied to the same port, the port is isolated.

## Introduction
Layer 3 Hardware Offloading (L3HW, otherwise known as IP switching or HW routing) allows to offload some router features onto the switch chip. This
allows reaching wire speeds when routing packets, which would simply not be possible with the CPU.

## Switch Configuration
To enable Layer 3 Hardware Offloading, set l3-hw-offloading=yes for the switch:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```

## Switch Port Configuration
Layer 3 Hardware Offloading can be configured for each physical switch port. For example:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set sfp-sfpplus1 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
Note that l3hw settings for switch and ports are different:
```
Setting l3-hw-offloading=no for the switch completely disables offloading - all packets will be routed by CPU.
```
```
However, setting l3-hw-offloading=no for a switch port only disables hardware routing from/to this particular port. Moreover, the port can still
participate in Fastrack connection offloading.
```
To enable full hardware routing, enable l3hw on all switch ports:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [find] l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
To make all packets go through the CPU first, and offload only the Fasttrack connections, disable l3hw on all ports but keep it enabled on the switch chip
itself:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [find] l3-hw-offloading=no
```
The next example enables hardware routing on all ports but the upstream port (sfp-sfpplus16). Packets going to/from sfp-sfpplus16 will enter the CPU and,
therefore, subject to Firewall/NAT processing.
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [find] l3-hw-offloading=yes
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set sfp-sfpplus16 l3-hw-offloading=no
```
L3HW Settings
Basic Settings
The L3HW Settings menu has been introduced in RouterOS version 7.6.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch l3hw-settings
```
Property Description
```
```
autorestart (ye
s | no; Default:
no)
```
```
Automatically restarts the l3hw driver in case of an error. Otherwise, if an error occurs, l3-hw-offloading gets disabled, and the
error code is displayed in the switch settings and #monitor. Autorestart does not work for system failures, such as OOM (Out Of
Memory).
```
```
fasttrack-hw (y
es | no;
Default: yes (if
supported))
```
```
Enables or disables FastTrack HW Offloading. Keep it enabled unless HW TCAM memory reservation is required, e.g., for dynamic
switch ACL rules creation. Not all switch chips support FastTrack HW Offloading (see hw-supports-fasttrack).
```
```
ipv6-hw (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
Enables or disables IPv6 Hardware Offloading. Since IPv6 routes occupy a lot of HW memory, enable it only if IPv6 traffic speed is
significant enough to benefit from hardware routing.
```
```
icmp-reply-on-
error (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Since the hardware cannot send ICMP messages, the packet must be redirected to the CPU to send an ICMP reply in case of an error
(e.g., "Time Exceeded", "Fragmentation required", etc.). Enabling icmp-reply-on-error helps with network diagnostics but may open
potential vulnerabilities for DDoS attacks. Disabling icmp-reply-on-error silently drops the packets on the hardware level in case of an
error.
```
Read-Only Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
hw-supports-fasttrack (yes | no) Indicates if the hardware (switch chip) supports FastTrack HW Offloading.
```
```
Packets get routed by the hardware only if both source and destination ports have l3-hw-offloading=yes. If at least one of them has l3-
hw-offloading=no, packets will go through the CPU/Firewall while offloading only the Fasttrack connections.
```
```
The existing connections may be unaffected by the l3-hw-offloading setting change.
```
Advanced Settings
This menu allows tweaking l3hw settings for specific use cases.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch l3hw-settings advanced
```
Property Description
```
```
route-
queue-
limit-high (
number;
Default:  256
)
```
```
The switch driver stops route indexing when route-queue-size (see #monitor) exceeds this value. Lowering this value leads to faster route
processing but increases the lag between a route's appearance in RouterOS and hardware memory.
```
```
Setting route-queue-limit-high=0 disables route indexing when there are any routes in the processing queue -  the most efficient CPU
usage but the longest delay before hardware offloading. Useful when there are static routes only. Not recommended together with routing
protocols (such as BGP or OSPF) when there are frequent routing table changes.
```
```
route-
queue-
limit-low (n
umber;
Default:  0 )
```
```
Re-enable route indexing when route-queue-size drops down to this value. Must not exceed the high limit.
```
```
Setting route-queue-limit-low=0 tells the switch driver to process all pending routes before the next hw-offloading attempt. While this is the
desired behavior, it may completely block the hw-offloading under a constant BGP feed.
```
```
shwp-
reset-
counter  (n
umber;
Default:  128
)
```
```
Reset the Shortest HW Prefix (see ipv4-shortest-hw-prefix / ipv6-shortest-hw-prefix in #monitor) and try the full route table offloading after
this amount of changes in the routing table. At a partial offload, when the entire routing table does not fit into the hardware memory and
shorter prefixes are redirected to the CPU, there is no need to try offloading route prefixes shorter than SHWP since those will get
redirected to the CPU anyway, theoretically. However, significant changes to the routing table may lead to a different index layout and,
therefore, a different amount of routes that can be hw-offloaded. That's why it is recommended to do the full table re-indexing occasionally.
```
```
Lowering this value may allow more routes to be hw-offloaded but increases CPU usage and vice-versa. Setting shwp-reset-counter=0 alw
ays does full re-indexing after each routing table change.
```
```
This setting is used only during Partial Offloading and has no effect when ipv4-shortest-hw-prefix=0 (and ipv6, respectively).
```
```
partial-
offload-
chunk (nu
mber;
Default:  10
24 , min:
16 )
```
```
The minimum number of routes for incremental adding in Partial Offloading. Depending on the switch chip model, routes are offloaded
either as-is (each routing entry in RouterOS corresponds to an entry in the hardware memory) or getting indexed, and the index entries are
the ones that are written into the hardware memory. This setting is used only for the latter during Partial Offloading.
```
```
Depending on index fragmentation, a single IPv4 route addition can occupy from -3 to +6 LPM blocks of HW memory (some route addition
may lower the amount of required HW memory thanks to index defragmentation). Hence, it is impossible to predict the exact number of
routes that may fit in the hardware memory. The switch driver uses a binary split algorithm to find the maximum number of routes that fit in
the hardware.
```
```
Let's imagine 128k routes, all of them not fitting into the hardware memory. The algorithm halves the number and tries offloading 64k
routes. Let's say offloading succeeded. In the next iteration, the algorithm picks 96k, let's say it fails; then 80k - fails again, 72k - succeeds,
76k, etc. until the difference between succeeded and failed numbers drops below the partial-offload-chunk value.
```
```
Lowering the partial-offload-chunk value increases the number of hw-offloaded routes but also raises CPU usage and vice-versa.
```
```
route-
index-
delay-min (
time;
Default: 1s)
```
```
The minimum delay between route processing and its offloading. The delay allows processing more routes together and offloading them at
once, saving CPU usage. It also makes offloading the entire routing table faster by reducing the per-route processing work. On the other
hand, it slows down the offloading of an individual route.
```
```
If an additional route is received during the delay, the latter resets to the route-index-delay-min value. Adding more and more routes within
the delay keeps resetting the timer until the route-index-delay-max is reached.
```
```
route-
index-
delay-max (
time;
Default: 10s
)
```
```
The maximum delay between route processing and its offloading. When the maximum delay is reached, the processed routes get
offloaded despite more routes pending. However, route-queue-limit-high has higher priority than this, meaning that the indexing/offloading
gets paused anyway when a certain queue size is reached.
```
```
It is NOT recommended to change the advanced L3HW settings unless instructed by MikroTik Support or MikroTik Certified Routing Engineer.
Applying incorrect settings may break the L3HW operation.
```
```
neigh-
keepalive-
interval (ti
me;
Default: 1 5s
, min: 5s)
```
```
Neighbor (host) keepalive interval. When a host (IP neighbor) gets hw-offloaded, all traffic from/to it is routed by the switch chip, and
RouterOS may think the neighbor is inactive and delete it. To prevent that, the switch driver must keep the offloaded neighbors alive by
sending periodical refreshes to RouterOS.
```
```
neigh-
discovery-
interval (ti
me;
Default:  1
m37s,
min: 30s)
```
```
Unfortunately, switch chips do not provide per-neighbor stats. Hence, the only way to check if the offloaded host is still active is by sending
occasional ARP (IPv4) / Neighbor Discovery (IPv6) requests to the connected network. Increasing the value lowers the broadcast traffic
but may leave inactive hosts in hardware memory for longer.
```
```
Neighbor discovery is triggered within the neighbor keepalive work. Hence, the discovery time is rounded up to the next keepalive session.
Choose a value for neigh-discovery-interval not dividable by neigh-keepalive-interval to send ARP/ND requests in various sessions,
preventing broadcast bursts.
```
```
neigh-
discovery-
burst-limit (
number;
Default:  64 )
```
```
The maximum number of ARP/ND requests that can be sent at once.
```
```
neigh-
discovery-
burst-
delay (time
; Default:  3
00ms,
min: 10ms)
```
```
The delay between ARP/ND subsequent bursts if the number of requests exceeds neigh-discovery-burst-limit.
```

Interface Lists
It is impossible to use interface lists directly to control l3-hw-offloading because an interface list may contain virtual interfaces (such as VLAN) while
the l3-hw-offloading setting must be applied to physical switch ports only. For example, if there are two VLAN interfaces (vlan20 and vlan30) running
on the same switch port (trunk port), it is impossible to enable hardware routing on vlan20 but keep it disabled on vlan30.
However, an interface list may be used as a port selector. The following example demonstrates how to enable hardware routing on LAN ports (ports that
belong to the "LAN" interface list) and disable it on WAN ports:
```
:foreach i in=[/interface/list/member/find where list=LAN] do={
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [/interface/list/member/get $i interface] l3-hw-offloading=yes
}
```
```
:foreach i in=[/interface/list/member/find where list=WAN] do={
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [/interface/list/member/get $i interface] l3-hw-offloading=no
}
```
Please take into account that since interface lists are not directly used in hardware routing control., modifying the interface list also does not automatically
reflect in l3hw changes. For instance, adding a switch port to the "LAN" interface list does not automatically enable l3-hw-offloading on it. The user
has to rerun the above script to apply the changes.
MTU
The hardware supports up to 8 MTU profiles, meaning that the user can set up to 8 different MTU values for interfaces: the default 1500 + seven custom
ones.
```
MTU Change Example
```
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=no
/interface set sfp-sfpplus1 mtu=9000 l2mtu=9022
/interface set sfp-sfpplus2 mtu=9000 l2mtu=9022
/interface set sfp-sfpplus3 mtu=10000 l2mtu=10022
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
Layer 2 Dependency
Layer 3 hardware processing lies on top of Layer 2 hardware processing. Therefore, L3HW offloading requires L2HW offloading on the underlying
interfaces. The latter is enabled by default, but there are some exceptions. For example, CRS3xx devices support only one hardware bridge. If there are
multiple bridges, others are processed by the CPU and are not subject to L3HW.
Another example is ACL rules. If a rule redirects traffic to the CPU for software processing, then hardware routing (L3HW) is not triggered:
```
It is recommended to disable l3-hw-offloading while changing the MTU/L2MTU values on the interfaces.
```
```
ACL rule to disable hardware processing on a specific port
```
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/rule/add switch=switch1 ports=ether1 redirect-to-cpu=yes
```
To make sure that Layer 3 is in sync with Layer 2 on both the software and hardware sides, we recommend disabling L3HW while configuring Layer 2
features. The recommendation applies to the following configuration:
```
adding/removing/enabling/disabling bridge;
adding/removing switch ports to/from the bridge;
bonding switch ports / removing bond;
changing VLAN settings;
changing MTU/L2MTU on switch ports;
changing ethernet (MAC) addresses.
```
In short, disable l3-hw-offloading while making changes under /interface/bridge/ and /interface/vlan/:
```
Layer 2 Configuration Template
```
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=no
```
```
/interface/bridge
# put bridge configuration changes here
```
```
/interface/vlan
# define/change VLAN interfaces
```
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
MAC telnet
There is a limitation for MAC telnet when L3HW offloading is enabled on 98DX8xxx, 98DX4xxx, or 98DX325x switch chips. Packets from MAC Telnet are
dropped and do not reach the CPU, thus access to the device will fail.
If MAC telnet is desired in combination with L3HW, certain ACL rule can be created to force these packets to the CPU.
For example, if MAC telnet access on sfp-sfpplus1 and sfp-sfpplus2 is needed, you will need to add this ACL rule. It is possible to select even more
interfaces with the ports setting.
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add dst-port=20561 ports=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 protocol=udp redirect-to-cpu=yes switch=switch1
```
Inter-VLAN Routing
Since L3HW depends on L2HW, and L2HW is the one that does VLAN processing, Inter-VLAN hardware routing requires a hardware bridge underneath.
Even if a particular VLAN has only one tagged port member, the latter must be a bridge member. Do not assign a VLAN interface directly on a switch port!
Otherwise, L3HW offloading fails and the traffic will get processed by the CPU:
/interface/vlan add interface=ether2 name=vlan20 vlan-id=20
Assign the VLAN interface to the bridge instead. This way, VLAN configuration gets offloaded to the hardware, and, with L3HW enabled, the traffic is
subject to inter-VLAN hardware routing.
```
It is recommended to turn off L3HW offloading during L2 configuration.
```
```
VLAN Configuration Example
```
```
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=no
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
/interface/bridge/vlan add bridge=bridge tagged=bridge,ether2 vlan-ids=20
/interface/vlan add interface=bridge name=vlan20 vlan-id=20
/ip/address add address=192.0.2.1/24 interface=vlan20
/interface/bridge set bridge vlan-filtering=yes
/interface/ethernet/switch set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
L3HW MAC Address Range Limitation (DX2000/DX3000 series only)
Marvell Prestera DX2000 and DX3000 switch chips have a hardware limitation that allows configuring only the last (least significant) octet of the MAC
address for each interface. The other five (most significant) octets are configured globally and, therefore, must be equal for all interfaces (switch ports,
bridge, VLANs). In other words, the MAC addresses must be in the format "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:??", where:
```
"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" part is common for all interfaces.
"??" is a variable part.
```
This requirement applies only to Layer 3 (routing). Layer 2 (bridging) does not use the switch's ethernet addresses. Moreover, it does not apply to bridge
ports because they use the bridge's MAC address.
The requirement for common five octets applies to:
```
Standalone switch ports (not bridge members) with hardware routing enabled (l3-hw-offloading=yes).
Bridge itself.
VLAN interfaces (those that use the bridge's MAC address by default).
```
Route Configuration
Suppressing HW Offload
By default, all the routes are participating to be hardware candidate routes. To further fine-tune which traffic to offload, there is an option for each route to
disable/enable suppress-hw-offload.
For example, if we know that the majority of traffic flows to the network where servers are located, we can enable offloading only to that specific destination:
```
/ip/route set [find where static && dst-address!="192.168.3.0/24"] suppress-hw-offload=yes
```
Now only the route to 192.168.3.0/24 has H-flag, indicating that it will be the only one eligible to be selected for HW offloading:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip/route print where static
Flags: A - ACTIVE; s - STATIC, y - COPY; H - HW-OFFLOADED
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY D
0 As 0.0.0.0/0 172.16.2.1 1
1 As 10.0.0.0/8 10.155.121.254 1
2 AsH 192.168.3.0/24 172.16.2.1 1
```
Routing Filters
```
For Inter-VLAN routing, the bridge interface must be a tagged member of every routable /interface/bridge/vlan/ entry.
```
```
H-flag does not indicate that the route is actually HW offloaded, it indicates only that the route can be selected to be HW offloaded.
```
For dynamic routing protocols like OSFP and BGP, it is possible to suppress HW offloading using routing filters. For example, to suppress HW offloading
on all OSFP instance routes, use "suppress-hw-offload yes" property:
```
/routing/ospf/instance
set [find name=instance1] in-filter-chain=ospf-input
/routing/filter/rule
add chain="ospf-input" rule="set suppress-hw-offload yes; accept"
```
Offloading Fasttrack Connections
Firewall filter rules have hw-offload option for Fasttrack, allowing fine-tuning connection offloading. Since the hardware memory for Fasttrack
connections is very limited, we can choose what type of connections to offload and, therefore, benefit from near-the-wire-speed traffic. The next example
offloads only TCP connections while UDP packets are routed via the CPU and do not occupy HW memory:
```
/ip/firewall/filter
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related hw-offload=yes protocol=tcp
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related hw-offload=no
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
```
Stateless Hardware Firewall
While connection tracking and stateful firewalling can be performed only by the CPU, the hardware can perform stateless firewalling via switch rules (ACL).
The next example prevents (on a hardware level) accessing a MySQL server from the ether1, and redirects to the CPU/Firewall packets from ether2 and
ether3:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add switch=switch1 dst-address=10.0.1.2/32 dst-port=3306 ports=ether1 new-dst-ports=""
add switch=switch1 dst-address=10.0.1.2/32 dst-port=3306 ports=ether2,ether3 redirect-to-cpu=yes
```
Switch Rules (ACL) vs. Fasttrack HW Offloading
Some firewall rules may be implemented both via switch rules (ACL) and CPU Firewall Filter + Fasttrack HW Offloading. Both options grant near-the-wire-
speed performance. So the question is which one to use?
First, not all devices support Fasttrack HW Offloading, and without HW offloading, Firewall Filter uses only software routing, which is dramatically slower
than its hardware counterpart. Second, even if Fasttrack HW Offloading is an option, a rule of thumb is:
Switch rules share the hardware memory with Fastrack connections. However, hardware resources are allocated for each Fasttrack connection while a
single ACL rule can match multiple connections. For example, if you have a guest WiFi network connected to sfp-sfpplus1 VLAN 10 and you don't want it
to access your internal network, simply create an ACL rule:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/rule
add switch=switch1 ports=sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-id=10 dst-address=10.0.0.0/8 new-dst-ports=""
```
The matched packets will be dropped on the hardware level. It is much better than letting all guest packets to the CPU for Firewall filtering.
Of course, ACL rules cannot match everything. For instance, ACL rules cannot filter connection states: accept established, drop others. That is where
Fasttrack HW Offloading gets into action - redirect the packets to the CPU by default for firewall filtering, then offload the established Fasttrack
connections. However, disabling l3-hw-offloading for the entire switch, port is not the only option.
```
Always use Switch Rules (ACL), if possible.
```
```
Define ACL rules with redirect-to-cpu=yes instead of setting l3-hw-offloading=no of the switch port for narrowing down the traffic
that goes to the CPU.
```
Configuration Examples
Inter-VLAN Routing with Upstream Port Behind Firewall/NAT
This example demonstrates how to benefit from near-to-wire-speed inter-VLAN routing while keeping Firewall and NAT running on the upstream port.
Moreover, Fasttrack connections to the upstream port get offloaded to hardware as well, boosting the traffic speed close to wire-level. Inter-VLAN traffic is
fully routed by the hardware, not entering the CPU/Firewall, and, therefore, not occupying the hardware memory of Fasttrack connections.
We use the CRS317-1G-16S+ model with the following setup:
```
sfp1-sfp4 - bridged ports, VLAN ID 20, untagged
sfp5-sfp8 - bridged ports, VLAN ID 30, untagged
sfp16 - the upstream port
ether1 - management port
```
Setup interface lists for easy access:
```
Interface Lists
```
```
/interface list
add name=LAN
add name=WAN
add name=MGMT
```
```
/interface list member
add interface=sfp-sfpplus1 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus2 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus3 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus4 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus5 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus6 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus7 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus8 list=LAN
add interface=sfp-sfpplus16 list=WAN
add interface=ether1 list=MGMT
```
```
Bridge Setup
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=yes
```
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus2 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus3 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus4 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus5 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus6 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus7 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=sfp-sfpplus8 pvid=30
```
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=bridge untagged=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2,sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge tagged=bridge untagged=sfp-sfpplus5,sfp-sfpplus6,sfp-sfpplus7,sfp-sfpplus8 vlan-ids=30
```
Routing requires dedicated VLAN interfaces. For standard L2 VLAN bridging (without inter-VLAN routing), the next step can be omitted.
```
VLAN Interface Setup for Routing
```
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge name=vlan20 vlan-id=20
add interface=bridge name=vlan30 vlan-id=30
```
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.20.17/24 interface=vlan20 network=192.168.20.0
add address=192.168.30.17/24 interface=vlan30 network=192.168.30.0
```
Configure management and upstream ports, a basic firewall, NAT, and enable hardware offloading of Fasttrack connections:
```
Firewall Setup
```
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=ether1
add address=10.0.0.17/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus16
```
```
/ip route
add gateway=10.0.0.1
```
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related hw-offload=yes
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
```
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface-list=WAN
```
At this moment, all routing still is performed by the CPU. Enable hardware routing on the switch chip:
```
Enable Layer 3 Hardware Offloading
```
```
# Enable full hardware routing on LAN ports
:foreach i in=[/interface/list/member/find where list=LAN] do={
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [/interface/list/member/get $i interface] l3-hw-offloading=yes
}
```
```
# Disable full hardware routing on WAN or Management ports
:foreach i in=[/interface/list/member/find where list=WAN or list=MGMT] do={
/interface/ethernet/switch/port set [/interface/list/member/get $i interface] l3-hw-offloading=no
}
```
```
# Activate Layer 3 Hardware Offloading on the switch chip
/interface/ethernet/switch/set 0 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
Results:
```
Within the same VLAN (e.g., sfp1-sfp4), traffic is forwarded by the hardware on Layer 2 (L2HW).
Inter-VLAN traffic (e.g. sfp1-sfp5) is routed by the hardware on Layer 3 (L3HW).
Traffic from/to the WAN port gets processed by the CPU/Firewall first. Then Fasttrack connections get offloaded to the hardware (Hardware-
Accelerated L4 Stateful Firewall). NAT applies both on CPU- and HW-processed packets.
Traffic to the management port is protected by the Firewall.
```
Typical Misconfiguration
Below are typical user errors in configuring Layer 3 Hardware Offloading.
VLAN interface on a switch port or bond
```
/interface/vlan
add name=vlan10 vlan-id=10 interface=sfp-sfpplus1
add name=vlan20 vlan-id=20 interface=bond1
```
VLAN interface must be set on the bridge due to Layer 2 Dependency. Otherwise, L3HW will not work. The correct configuration is:
```
/interface/bridge/port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
add bridge=bridge1 interface=bond1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
```
/interface/bridge/vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,bond1 vlan-ids=20
```
```
/interface/vlan
add name=vlan10 vlan-id=10 interface=bridge1
add name=vlan20 vlan-id=20 interface=bridge1
```
Not adding the bridge interface to /interface/bridge/vlan/
For Inter-VLAN routing, the bridge interface itself needs to be added to the tagged members of the given VLANs. In the next example, Inter-VLAN routing
works between VLAN 10 and 11, but packets are NOT routed to VLAN 20.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=10 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1
add bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=11 tagged=bridge1 untagged=sfp-sfpplus2,sfp-sfpplus3
add bridge=bridge1 vlan-ids=20 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=sfp-sfpplus4,sfp-sfpplus5
```
The above example does not always mean an error. Sometimes, you may want the device to act as a simple L2 switch in some/all VLANs. Just make sure
you set such behavior on purpose, not due to a mistake.
Creating multiple bridges
The devices support only one hardware bridge. If there are multiple bridges created, only one gets hardware offloading. While for L2 that means software
forwarding for other bridges, in the case of L3HW, multiple bridges may lead to undefined behavior.
Using ports that do not belong to the switch
Some devices have two switch chips or the management port directly connected to the CPU. For example, CRS312-4C+8XG has an ether9 port
connected to a separate switch chip. Trying to add this port to a bridge or involve it in the L3HW setup leads to unexpected results. Leave the management
port for management!
```
Instead of creating multiple bridges, create one and segregate L2 networks with VLAN filtering.
```

```
Relying on Fasttrack HW Offloading too much
Since Fasttrack HW Offloading offers near-the-wire-speed performance at zero configuration overhead, the users are tempted to use it as the default
solution. However, the number of HW Fasttrack connections is very limited, leaving the other traffic for the CPU. Try using the hardware routing as much
as possible, reduce the CPU traffic to the minimum via switch ACL rules, and then fine-tune which Fasttrack connections to offload with firewall filter rules.
Trying to offload slow-path connections
Using certain configurations (e.g. enabling bridge "use-ip-firewall" setting, creating bridge nat/filter rules) or running specific features like sniffer or torch can
disable RouterOS FastPath, which will affect the ability to properly FastTrack and HW offload connections. If HW offloaded Fasttrack is required, make
sure that there are no settings that disable the FastPath and verify that connections are getting the "H" flag or use the L3HW monitor command to see the
amount of HW offloaded connections.

(^1) Since the total amount of routes that can be offloaded is limited, prefixes with higher netmask are preferred to be forwarded by hardware (e.g., /32, /30,
/29, etc.), any other prefixes that do not fit in the HW table will be processed by the CPU. Directly connected hosts are offloaded as /32 (IPv4) or /128
(IPv6) route prefixes. The number of hosts is also limited by max-neighbor-entries in IP Settings / IPv6 Settings.
(^2) IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables share the same hardware memory.
(^3)  If a route has more paths than the hardware ECMP limit (X), only the first X paths get offloaded.

(^1) Depends on the complexity of the routing table. Whole-byte IP prefixes (/8, /16, /24, etc.) occupy less HW space than others (e.g., /22). Starting with Rout
erOS v7.3, when the Routing HW table gets full, only routes with longer subnet prefixes are offloaded (/30, /29, /28, etc.) while the CPU processes the
shorter prefixes. In RouterOS v7.2 and before, Routing HW memory overflow led to undefined behavior. Users can fine-tune what routes to offload via
routing filters (for dynamic routes) or suppressing hardware offload of static routes. IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables share the same hardware memory.
(^2) When the HW limit of Fasttrack or NAT entries is reached, other connections will fall back to the CPU. MikroTik's smart connection offload algorithm
ensures that the connections with the most traffic are offloaded to the hardware.
(^3) Fasttrack connections share the same HW memory with ACL rules. Depending on the complexity, one ACL rule may occupy the memory of 3-6 Fasttrack
connections.
(^4) MPLS shares the HW memory with Fasttrack connections. Moreover, enabling MPLS requires the allocation of the entire memory region, which could
otherwise store up to 768 (0.75K) Fasttrack connections. The same applies to the Bridge Port Extender. However, MPLS and BPE may use the same
memory region, so enabling them both doesn't double the limitation of Fasttrack connections.
(^5) If a Fasttrack connection requires Network Address Translation, a hardware NAT entry is created. The hardware supports both SRCNAT and DSTNAT.
(^6)  The switch chip has a feature set of the DX8000 series.
(^7) DX4000/DX8000 switch chips store directly connected hosts, IPv4 /32, and IPv6 /128 route entries in the FDB table rather than the routing table. The HW
memory is shared between regular FDB L2 entries (MAC), IPv4, and IPv6 addresses. The number of hosts is also limited by max-neighbor-entries in IP
Settings / IPv6 Settings.

## Overview
The MACsec (Media Access Control Security) protocol is a standard security technology employed in Ethernet networks to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted over the physical medium. MACsec is defined by IEEE standard 802.1AE.
MACsec utilizes GCM-AES-128 encryption over Ethernet and secures all LAN traffic, including DHCP, ARP, LLDP, and higher-layer protocols.

## Basic Configuration Example
Imagine Host1 ether1 is connected to Switch ether1 and Host2 ether1 is connected to Switch ether2. In this example, we will create two MACsec interface
pairs and use a bridge to create a secure Layer2 connection between both end devices.
First, configure MACsec interfaces on Host1 and Host2. We can specify only the Ethernet interface and RouterOS will automatically generate the
Connectivity Association Key (CAK) and connectivity association name (CKN). Use the print command to see the values:
```
# Host1
/interface macsec
add interface=ether1 name=macsec1
```
```
[admin@Host2] /interface/macsec print
Flags: I - inactive, X - disabled, R - running
0 name="macsec1" mtu=1468 interface=ether1 status="negotiating" cak=71a7c363794da400dbde595d3926b0e9
ckn=f2c4660060169391d29d8db8a1f06e5d4b84a128bad06ad43ea2bd4f7d21968f profile=default
```
```
# Host2
/interface macsec
add interface=ether1 name=macsec1
```
```
[admin@Host2] /interface/macsec print
Flags: I - inactive, X - disabled, R - running
0 name="macsec1" mtu=1468 interface=ether1 status="negotiating" cak=dc47d94291d19a6bb26a0c393a1af9a4
ckn=e9bd0811dad1e56f06876aa7715de1855f1aee0baf5982ac8b508d4fc0f162d9 profile=default
```
On the Switch device, to enable MACsec we need to configure the matching CAK and CKN values for the appropriate Ethernet interface:
```
# Switch
/interface macsec
add comment=Host1 cak=71a7c363794da400dbde595d3926b0e9
ckn=f2c4660060169391d29d8db8a1f06e5d4b84a128bad06ad43ea2bd4f7d21968f interface=ether1 name=macsec1
add comment=Host2 cak=dc47d94291d19a6bb26a0c393a1af9a4
ckn=e9bd0811dad1e56f06876aa7715de1855f1aee0baf5982ac8b508d4fc0f162d9 interface=ether2 name=macsec2
```
Once the pre-shared keys are successfully exchanged, the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol is activated. MKA is responsible for ensuring the
continuity of MACsec on the link and determines which side becomes the key server in a point-to-point connection. The key server generates a Secure
Association Key (SAK) that is shared exclusively with the device on the other end of the link. This SAK is used to secure all data traffic passing through the
link. Periodically, the key server generates a new randomly-created SAK and shares it over the point-to-point link to maintain MACsec functionality.
```
RouterOS MACsec implementation is in the early stage, it does not support dynamic key management via Dot1x (manual key configuration is
required) and hardware-accelerated encryption (maximum throughput is highly limited by the device CPU).
```
In RouterOS, the MACsec interface can be configured like any Ethernet interface. It can be used as a routable interface with an IP address, or placed
inside a bridge. On Host1 and Host2 we will add an IP address from the same network. On Switch, we will use a bridge.
```
# Host1
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.10/24 interface=macsec1
```
```
# Host2
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.20/24 interface=macsec1
```
```
# Switch
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=macsec1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=macsec2
```
Last, confirm that Host1 can reach Host2 using a ping.
```

# MACVLAN
```
Overview
Basic Configuration Example
Property Reference
```

## Overview
The MACVLAN provides a means to create multiple virtual network interfaces, each with its own unique Media Access Control (MAC) address, attached to
a physical network interface. This technology is utilized to address specific network requirements, such as obtaining multiple IP addresses or establishing
distinct PPPoE client connections from a single physical Ethernet interface while using different MAC addresses. Unlike traditional VLAN (Virtual LAN)
interfaces, which rely on Ethernet frames tagged with VLAN identifiers, MACVLAN operates at the MAC address level, making it a versatile and efficient
solution for specific networking scenarios.

## Basic Configuration Example
Picture a scenario where the ether1 interface connects to your ISP, and your router needs to lease two IP addresses, each with a distinct MAC address.
Traditionally, this would require the use of two physical Ethernet interfaces and an additional switch. However, a more efficient solution is to create a virtual
MACVLAN interface.
To create a MACVLAN interface, select the needed Ethernet interface. A MAC address will be automatically assigned if not manually specified:
```
/interface macvlan
add interface=ether1 name=macvlan1
```
```
/interface macvlan print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, MTU, INTERFACE, MAC-ADDRESS, MODE
# NAME MTU INTERFACE MAC-ADDRESS MODE
0 R macvlan1 1500 ether1 76:81:BF:68:69:83 bridge
```
Now, a DHCP client can be created on ether1 and macvlan1 interfaces:
```
/ip dhcp-client
add interface=ether1
add interface=macvlan1
```

## Property Reference
Sub-menu: /interface/macvlan
Configuration settings for the MACVLAN interface.
```
Property Description
```
```
RouterOS MACVLAN interfaces are not supported by Container, as it exclusively utilizes VETH (Virtual Ethernet) interfaces for its networking.
```
```
A MACVLAN interface can only receive broadcast packets, packets addressed to its own MAC address, and a limited number of multicast
addresses. If the physical interface has a VLAN configured, the MACVLAN interface cannot receive packets from that VLAN.
```
```
For bridging and more complex Layer2 solutions involving VLANs, a dedicated switch should be used instead.
```
arp (disabled | enabled |
local-proxy-arp | proxy-arp |

```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface
proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address
combinations, which are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically
stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore, for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
```

## Overview
This document defines Quality of Service (QoS) usage in RouterOS based on Marvell Prestera DX switch chips (CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, and
CCR2116, CCR2216 routers).
QoS is a set of features in network switches that allow network administrators to prioritize traffic and allocate network resources to ensure that important
data flows smoothly and with low latency.
The primary function of QoS in network switches is to manage network traffic in a way that meets the specific requirements of different types of network
applications. For example, voice and video data require low latency and minimal packet loss to ensure high-quality communication, while file transfers and
other data applications can tolerate higher levels of latency and packet loss.
QoS works by identifying the type of traffic flowing through the switch and assigning it a priority level based on its requirements. The switch can then use
this information to alter packet headers and prioritize the flow of traffic, ensuring that higher-priority traffic is given preferential treatment over lower-priority
traffic.
RouterOS v7.15+ is required to support all QoS features:
```
QoS Marking. QoS profile matching by ingress packet headers, then egress header alternation according to the assigned QoS profiles.
QoS Enforcement. Avoid or resolve congestion based on the assigned QoS profiles and traffic shaping.
QoS Policy. Assign QoS profiles via ACL rules.
Active Queue Management: WRED (Weighted Random Early Detection), ECN notification, and processing, PFC (Priority-based Flow Control).
Traffic shaping.
```
QoS Terminology
These terms will be used throughout the article.
```
QoS - Quality of Service.
ACL - Access Control List, a set of switch rules used to filter network traffic based on specified criteria.
AQM - Active Queue Management.
DSCP - Differentiated Services Code Point, a 6-bit field in the IP header used to prioritize network traffic.
ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification.
ETS - Enhanced Transmission Selection.
PCP - Priority Code Point, a 3-bit field in the VLAN header used to prioritize traffic within a VLAN.
PFC - Priority-based Flow Control (IEEE 802.1Qbb).
RoCE - RDMA over Converged Ethernet.
WRED - Weighted Random Early Detection.
/in/eth/sw/ a shortcut for /interface/ethernet/switch/. The shortcut works in CLI, too.

(^1) Due to hardware limitations, some switch chip models may break traffic flow while accessing QoS port/queue usage data.
(^2) The device gathers max queue fill statistics instead of displaying the current usage values. Use the reset-counters command to reset those stats.
(^3) The devices without PFC profiles do not support Priority-based Flow Control.
(^4) Usage data for individual queues on a port are unavailable, only the total usage for the entire port can be accessed.
(^5) Due to hardware limitations, PFC settings cannot be configured on certain switch ports. For CRS354 series models, PFC is not supported on ports ether37
to ether48. For the CRS520-4XS-16XQ model, PFC is not supported on ports qsfp28-4-1 to qsfp28-7-4.
Applications and Usage Examples
Basic Configuration Example
In this example, we define just one QoS level - VoIP (IP Telephony) on top of the standard "Best Effort" class. Let's imagine that we have a CRS326-24G-
2S+ device where:
```
all ports are bridged and using vlan-filtering;
sfp-sfpplus1 is a VLAN trunk connected to another switch;
ether1-ether9 are dedicated ports for IP phones;
ether10-ether24 are standard ports for host connection;
```
First, we need to define QoS profiles. Defined dscp and pcp values that will be used in forwarded packets on egress:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos profile
add dscp=46 name=voip pcp=5 traffic-class=5
```
Port-based QoS profile assignment on dedicated ports for IP phones applies to ingress traffic. Other Ethernet ports will use the default profile (where ds
cp=0 and pcp=0):
```
/interface ethernet switch qos port
set ether1 profile=voip
set ether2 profile=voip
set ether3 profile=voip
set ether4 profile=voip
set ether5 profile=voip
set ether6 profile=voip
set ether7 profile=voip
set ether8 profile=voip
set ether9 profile=voip
```
The trunk port receives both types of QoS traffic. We need to create VLAN priority mapping with the QoS profile and enable trust-l2 to differentiate
them:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos map vlan
add pcp=5 profile=voip
```
```
/interface ethernet switch qos port
set sfp-sfpplus1 trust-l2=trust
```
Finally, enable QoS hardware offloading for the above settings to start working:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 qos-hw-offloading=yes
```
It is possible to verify the port QoS settings with print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface/ethernet/switch/qos/port print
Columns: NAME, SWITCH, PROFILE, MAP, TRUST-L2, TRUST-L3
# NAME SWITCH PROFILE MAP TRUST-L2 TRUST-L3 TX-MANAGER
0 ether1 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
1 ether2 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
2 ether3 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
3 ether4 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
4 ether5 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
5 ether6 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
6 ether7 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
7 ether8 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
8 ether9 switch1 voip default ignore ignore default
9 ether10 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
10 ether11 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
11 ether12 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
12 ether13 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
13 ether14 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
14 ether15 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
15 ether16 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
16 ether17 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
17 ether18 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
18 ether19 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
19 ether20 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
20 ether21 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
21 ether22 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
22 ether23 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
23 ether24 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
24 sfp-sfpplus1 switch1 default default trust ignore default
25 sfp-sfpplus2 switch1 default default ignore ignore default
26 switch1-cpu switch1
```
Now incoming packets on ports ether1-ether9 are marked with a Priority Code Point (PCP) value of 5 and a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
value of 46, and incoming packets on ports ether10-ether24 are marked with PCP and DSCP values of 0. When packets are incoming to sfp-sfpplus1 port,
any packets with a PCP value of 5 will retain their PCP value of 5 and DSCP value of 46, while all other packets will be marked with PCP and DSCP
values of 0.
Dante
Starting from RouterOS v7.15, all MikroTik QoS-Capable devices comply with Dante.
Dante hardware use the following DSCP / Diffserv priority values for traffic prioritization.
```
Dante Priority Usage DSCP Label DSCP Value
```
```
High Time critical PTP events CS7 56
```
```
Medium Audio, PTP EF 46
```
```
Low (reserved) CS1 8
```
```
None Other traffic BE 0
```
The example assumes that the switch is using its default configuration, which includes a default "bridge" interface and all Ethernet interfaces added as
bridge ports, and any of these interfaces could be used for Dante.
First, create QoS Profiles to match Dante traffic classes, there is already a pre-existing "default" profile that corresponds to Dante's None priority.
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/qos/profile
add name=dante-ptp dscp=56 pcp=7 traffic-class=7
add name=dante-audio dscp=46 pcp=5 traffic-class=5
add name=dante-low dscp=8 pcp=1 traffic-class=0
```
Then, create a QoS mapping to match QoS profiles based on DSCP values.
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/qos/map/ip
add dscp=56 profile=dante-ptp
add dscp=46 profile=dante-audio
add dscp=8 profile=dante-low
```
Configure hardware queues to enforce QoS on Dante traffic.
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/qos/tx-manager/queue
set [find where traffic-class>=2] schedule=strict-priority
set [find where traffic-class<2] schedule=low-priority-group weight=1
```
Dante's High and Medium priority traffic is scheduled in strict order. The devices transmits time-critical PTP packets until queue7 gets empty, then proceed
with audio (queue5). Low and other traffic gets transmitted only when PTP and audio queues are empty. Since Dante does not define priority order
between Low and Other traffic (usually, CS1 has lower priority than Best Effort), and the Low traffic class is reserved for future use anyway, we treat both
traffic types equally by putting both into the same group with the same weight. Feel free to change the CS1/BE traffic scheduling according to the
requirements if some Dante hardware in your network uses the low-priority traffic class.
The next step is to enable trust mode for incoming Layer3 packets (IP DSCP field):
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/qos/port
set [find] trust-l3=keep
```
Finally, enable QoS hardware offloading for the above settings to start working:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 qos-hw-offloading=yes
```
When using Dante in multicast mode, it is beneficial to enable IGMP snooping on the switch. This feature directs traffic only to ports with subscribed
devices, preventing unnecessary flooding. Additionally, enabling an IGMP querier (if not already enabled on another device in the same LAN), adjusting
query intervals, and activating fast-leave can further optimize multicast performance.
```
/interface/bridge
set [find name=bridge] igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yes query-interval=60s
```
```
/interface/bridge/port
set [find] fast-leave=yes
```
RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)
RoCE allows you to directly access memory on remote storage systems using Ethernet networks without involving the host CPU. This capability
significantly reduces latency and CPU overhead, making RoCE ideal for high-performance computing and data center environments. RoCE also enables a
converged network, where various services (such as data storage, networking, and multimedia) run over a single Ethernet infrastructure. This simplifies
network management and reduces the cost and complexity of maintaining separate networks.
RoCE achieves this through the use of ECN and PFC mechanisms. These features help prevent network congestion and packet loss, ensuring reliable,
lossless communication. See the device feature table for compatible switches. Although switches can support RoCE environments, the end hosts must
also be compatible with the RoCE protocol and equipped with RDMA-capable network interface cards (NICs).
There are two main versions of RoCE. RoCEv1 operates as an Ethernet link layer protocol and uses Ethertype 0x8915. RoCEv2 works over standard IP
networks, using UDP destination port number 4791. ECN bits in the IP header are marked to signal network congestion, and a Congestion Notification
Packet (CNP) is used to acknowledge congestion to the sender. For traffic prioritization, DSCP 26 is used for RoCEv2 traffic, while DSCP 48 for CNPs.
The following example can be used for lossless RoCEv2 with PFC and ECN and it assumes that the switch is using its default configuration, which
includes a default "bridge" interface and all Ethernet interfaces added as bridge ports. The minimal recommended RouterOS version is 7.17.
First, configure additional profiles. Non-RoCE traffic will be assigned to already existing "default" profile with traffic-class 1, RoCEv2 to traffic-class 3, and
CNP to traffic-class 6.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos profile
add name=roce traffic-class=3
add name=cnp traffic-class=6
```
Create a QoS mapping to match QoS profiles based on DSCP values.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos map ip
add dscp=26 profile=roce
add dscp=48 profile=cnp
```
Configure hardware queues and scheduler. We are using ETS (schedule=high-priority-group) for traffic-class 1 and traffic-class 3 with 50%
bandwith assigment each (weight=1), and strict priority scheduling for traffic-class 6. Additionally, configure a separate shared memory pool (shared-
pool-index=1) for lossless traffic in traffic-class 3 and enable ECN (ecn=yes) to mark IP packets in the switch that experience congestion.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos tx-manager queue
set 1 schedule=high-priority-group weight=1
set 3 schedule=high-priority-group weight=1 shared-pool-index=1 ecn=yes
set 6 schedule=strict-priority
```
Configure PFC profile for traffic-class 3 to ensure a lossless environment for RoCEv2 traffic.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos priority-flow-control
add name=pfc-tc3 rx=yes traffic-class=3 tx=yes
```
Set Layer3 trust mode (trust-l3=keep) on switch ports where RoCEv2 traffic is expected, set PFC (pfc=pfc-tc3) and egress-rate for queue3 to
comply with PFC requirements (egress-rate-queue3=10.0Gbps). In this example, 10Gbps SFP+ interfaces are used, and the egress rate can be set
to match the physical speed of the interface. Change this property depending on your interface speeds.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos port
set sfp-sfpplus1 egress-rate-queue3=10.0Gbps pfc=pfc-tc3 trust-l3=keep
set sfp-sfpplus2 egress-rate-queue3=10.0Gbps pfc=pfc-tc3 trust-l3=keep
set sfp-sfpplus3 egress-rate-queue3=10.0Gbps pfc=pfc-tc3 trust-l3=keep
set sfp-sfpplus4 egress-rate-queue3=10.0Gbps pfc=pfc-tc3 trust-l3=keep
```
Enable QoS hardware offloading for the above settings to start working.
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 qos-hw-offloading=yes
```
Enable the LLDP Data Center Bridging Capability Exchange Protocol (DCBX) to share QoS settings and capabilities with other neighboring devices.
```
/ip neighbor discovery-settings
set lldp-dcbx=yes
```
As an optional step, increase the L2MTU to accommodate larger data packets.
```
/interface ethernet
set [find switch=switch1] l2mtu=9500
```
```
Although using schedule=low-priority-group allows you to create separate ETS scheduling and bandwidth allocation for a different set
of traffic-classes, it is not recommended to use this setting together with lldp-dcbx=yes. The reason is that the ETS Configuration
/Recommendation TLVs are designed to handle a single bandwidth allocation across traffic classes, thus schedule=high-priority-group
should be used instead.
```
QoS Marking
Understanding Map ranges
In order to avoid defining all possible PCP and DSCP mappings, RouterOS allows setting multiple values and ranges for PCP and DSCP values for QoS
Profile mapping.
In the following example, PCP values 0 and 2 use the default QoS profile, 1, 3-4 - streaming, 5 - voip, and 6-7 - control.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos map vlan
add pcp=1,3-4 profile=streaming
add pcp=5 profile=voip
add pcp=6-7 profile=control
```
Understanding Port, Profile, and Map relation
Each switch port has Layer2 and Layer3 trust settings that will change how ingress packets are classified into QoS profiles and what PCP and DSCP
values will be used. Below are tables that describe all possible options:
```
qos-
trust-
l2
```
```
qos-
trust-
l3
```
```
Behavior
```
```
ignore ignore The port is considered untrusted. Both headers are ignored, and the port's profile is forced to all ingress packets. This is the default
setting.
```
```
ignore trust Trust the Layer 3 header. Use the DSCP field from the IP header of ingress packets for QoS profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos
/map/ip). If the lookup fails (no QoS profiles are mapped to the given DSCP value), the default QoS profile is used (not the switch
port's QoS profile). The switch port's profile field is used only for non-IP traffic.
```
```
ignore keep Trust the Layer 3 header. Use the DSCP field from the IP header of ingress packets for QoS profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos
/map/ip). If the lookup fails, the default QoS profile is used. The switch port's profile field is used only for non-IP traffic. If the
forwarded/routed packet is VLAN-tagged, its PCP value is set from the selected QoS profile. However, the original DSCP value of
the packet is kept intact.
```
```
trust ignore Trust the Layer 2 header, but ignore L3. If an ingress packet is VLAN-tagged, use the PCP field from the VLAN header for QoS
profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos/map/vlan). If the lookup fails (no QoS profiles are mapped to the given PCP value), the defa
ult QoS profile is used. The switch port's profile field is used only for untagged traffic.
```
```
trust trust Trust both headers, but Layer 3 has higher precedence. In the case of an IP packet, use the DSCP field for QoS profile lookup (see /
in/eth/sw/qos/map/ip). If the DSCP-to-QoS lookup fails, use the default profile. If the packet is not an IP packet but is VLAN-
tagged, use the PCP field from the VLAN header for QoS profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos/map/vlan).  If the VLAN-to-QoS
lookup fails, use the default QoS profile. Non-IP untagged packets use the switch port's profile.
```
```
trust keep The same as trust+trust, but the original DSCP value is preserved in forwarded/routed packets.
```
```
keep ignore Trust the Layer 2 header but ignore L3. If an ingress packet is VLAN-tagged, use the PCP field from the VLAN header for QoS
profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos/map/vlan). If the lookup fails (no QoS profiles are mapped to the given PCP value), the defa
ult QoS profile is used. The switch port's profile field is used only for untagged traffic. If the packet is VLAN-tagged on both ingress
and egress, the original PCP value is kept.
```
```
keep trust Trust both headers, but Layer 3 has higher precedence. In the case of an IP packet, use the DSCP field for QoS profile lookup (see /

tagged, use the PCP field from the VLAN header for QoS profile lookup (see /in/eth/sw/qos/map/vlan).  If the VLAN-to-QoS
lookup fails, use the default QoS profile. Non-IP untagged packets use the switch port's profile. If the packet is VLAN-tagged on both
ingress and egress, the original PCP value is kept. The DSCP value in forwarded/routed packets is set from the selected QoS profile.

QoS Marking via Switch Rules (ACL)
Starting from RouterOS v7.15, it is possible to assign QoS profiles via Switch Rules (ACL).
Sub-menu: /interface/ethernet/switch/rule
New/Changed
Properties
Description
new-qos-profile (name) The name of the QoS profile to assign to the matched packets.
keep-qos-fields (yes | no;
Default: no)
Should the original values of QoS fields (PCP, DSCP) be kept (yes), or replace them with the ones from the assigned QoS
profile (no)? Relevant only if new-qos-profile is set.
new-vlan-priority (0..7) Deprecated and should be replaced with the respective new-qos-profile. Kept for backward compatibility. Relevant only if
qos-hw-offloading=no.
The following example assigns a QoS profile based on the source MAC address.
/interface ethernet switch rule
add new-qos-profile=stream ports=ether1,ether2 src-mac-address=00:01:02:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
switch=switch1
add new-qos-profile=voip ports=ether1,ether2 src-mac-address=04:05:06:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:00:00:00 switch=switch1
QoS Enforcement
Hardware Queues
Each switch port has eight hardware transmission (tx) queues (queue0..queue7). Each queue corresponds to a traffic class (tc0..tc7) set by a QoS profile.
Each ingress packet gets assigned to a QoS profile, which, in turn, determines the traffic class for tx queue selection on the egress port.
Hardware queues are of variable size - set by the Transmission Manager. Moreover, multiple ports and/or queues can share resources with each other (so-
called Shared Buffers). For example, a device with 25 ports has memory (buffers) to queue 1200 packets in total. If we split the resources equally, each
port gets 48 exclusive buffers with a maximum of 6 packets per queue (48/8) - which is usually insufficient to absorb even a short burst of traffic. However,
choosing to share 50% of the buffers leaves each port with 24 exclusive buffers (3 per queue), but at the same time, a single queue can grow up to 603
buffers (3 exclusive + 600 shared).
RouterOS allows enabling/disabling the shared pool for each queue individually - for example, to prevent low-priority traffic from consuming the entire
hardware memory. In addition, port buffer limits may prevent a single low-speed port from consuming the entire shared pool. See QoS Settings and  Trans
mission Manager for details.
Hardware Resources
The hardware (switch chips) has limited resources (memory). There are two main hardware resources that are relevant to QoS:
```
Packet descriptors - contain packet control information (target port, header alternation, etc).
Data buffers - memory chunks containing the actual payload. Buffer size depends on the switch chip model. Usually - 256 bytes.
```
One packet descriptor may use multiple buffers (depending on the payload size); buffers may be shared by multiple descriptors - in cases of multicast
/broadcast. If the hardware does not have enough free descriptors or buffers, the packet gets dropped (tail-drop).
Hardware resources can be limited per destination type (multicast/unicast), per port, and per each tx queue. If any limits are reached, no more packets can
be enqueued for transmission, and further packets get dropped.
RouterOS obscures low-level hardware information, allowing to set resource limits either in terms of packets or a percentage of the total amount. RouterOS
automatically calculates the required hardware descriptor and buffer count based on the user-specified packet limit and port's MTU. Moreover, RouterOS
comes with preconfigured hardware resources, so there is no need to do a manual configuration in common QoS environments.
Resource Saving
Since reallocating hardware resources in runtime is not an option, RouterOS cannot automatically free queue buffers reserved for inactive ports. Those
buffers remain unused. However, if the user knows that the specific ports will never be used (e.g., stay physically disconnected), the respective queue
resources can be manually freed by using the built-in "offline" tx-manager with minimum resources:
```
/interface/ethernet/switch/qos/port
set [find where !running] tx-manager=offline
```
Traffic Prioritization
The hardware provides two types of traffic transmission prioritization:
```
Strict Priority - traffic from higher queues is always transmitted first;
Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS) - multiple queues participate in packet transmission scheduling at the same time.
```
Strict priority queues are straightforward. If the highest priority queue (Q7) has packets, those are transmitted first. When Q7 is empty, packets from Q6 get
transmitted, and so on. The packets from the lowest priority queue (Q0) are transmitted only if all other queues are empty.
The downside of strict prioritization is increased latency in lower queues while "overprioritizing" higher queues. Suppose the acceptable latency of TC5 is
20ms, TC3 - 50ms. Traffic appearing in Q5 gets immediately transmitted due to the strict priority of the queue, adding extra latency to every packet in the
lower queues (Q4..Q0). A packet burst in Q5 (e.g., a start of a voice call) may temporarily "paralyze" Q3, increasing TC3 latencies over the acceptable
50ms (or even causing packet drops due to full queue) while TC5 packets get transmitted at <1ms (way below the 20ms limit). Slightly sacrificing TC5
latency by transmitting TC3 packets in between would make everybody happy. That ETS is for.
Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS) schedule traffic for transmission from multiple queues (group members) in a weighted round-robin manner. A
queue's weight sets the number of packets transmitted from the queue in each round. For example, if Q2, Q1, and Q0 are the group members, and their
weights are 3, 2, and 1, respectively, the scheduler transmits 3 packets from Q2, 2 - from Q1, and 1 - from Q0. The actual Tx order is "Q2, Q1, Q0, Q2, Q1,
Q2" - for even fairer scheduling.
There are two hardware groups: low-priority-group and high-priority-group. There is a strict priority ordering between the two groups: the low-
priority-group is transmitting only when all queues in the high-priority-group are empty. However, it is possible to use only one group for all queues.
The default (built-in) RouterOS queue setup is listed below. Q3-Q5 share the bandwidth within the high-priority group, where packets are transmitted while
Q6 and Q7 are empty. Q0-Q2 are the members of the low-priority-group, where packets are transmitted while Q3-Q7 are empty.
```
The default, best-effort (PCP=0, DSCP=0) traffic class is 1, while the lowest priority (PCP=1) has traffic class 0.
```
```
Changing any hardware resource allocation parameter in runtime results in a temporary device halt when no packets can be enqueued nor
transmitted. Temporary packet loss is expected while the device is forwarding traffic.

Active Queue Management (AQM)
Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)
WRED is a per-queue congestion control mechanism that signals congestion events to the end-points by dropping packets. WRED relies on the existence
of rate throttling mechanisms in the end-points that react to packet loss, such as TCP/IP. WRED uses a randomized packet drop algorithm in an attempt to
anticipate congestion events and respond to them by throttling traffic rates before the congestion actually happens. The randomness property of WRED
prevents throughput collapse related to the global synchronization of TCP flows.
WRED can be enabled/disabled per each queue in each Tx Manager. Disable WRED for lossless traffic! Also, there is no reason to enable WRED on high-
speed ports where congestion should not happen in the first place.
The behavior is controlled via WRED threshold. WRED threshold is the maximum number of packets/bytes that can exceed the queue shared buffer limit
(cap). A random packet drop begins when queue usage exceeds their respective capacities:
```
queueX-packet-use > queueX-shared-packet-cap or
queueX-byte-use > queueX-shared-byte-cap.
```
The more usage exceeds capacity, the higher the packet drop chance, reaching 100% at queueX-shared-packet-cap + wred-packet-threshold
(or byte).
RouterOS automatically chooses the actual WRED threshold values according to queue or shared pool capacities. The user may shift the thresholds in
one way or another via QoS Settings.
Choosing a WRED threshold value is a tradeoff between congestion anticipation and burst absorption. Setting a higher WRED threshold may lead to
earlier traffic rate throttling and, therefore, resolve congestion. On the other hand, a high threshold leads to packet drops in limited traffic bursts that could
be absorbed by the queue buffers and transformed losslessly if WRED didn't kick in. For instance, initiating a remote database connection usually starts
with heavier traffic ("packet burst") at the initialization phase; then, the traffic rate drops down to a "reasonable" level. Any packet drop during the
initialization phase leads to nothing but a slower database connection due to the need for retransmission. Hence, lowering the WRED threshold or entirely
disabling WRED on such traffic is advised. The opposite case is video streaming. Early congestion detection helps select a comfortable streaming rate
without losing too much bandwidth on retransmission or/and "overshooting" by sacrificing the quality level by too much.
The following script only applies WRED to TCP/IP traffic by redirecting it to queue2. UDP and other packets are left in queue1 - since their end-points
usually cannot respond to early drops. Queue1 and queue2 are scheduled equally - without prioritizing one queue over another.
```
It is recommended that all group members are adjacent to each other.
```
```
WRED requires the respective Tx queues to use shared buffers (use-shared-buffers=yes).
```
```
Use Switch Rules (ACL) or other QoS Marking techniques to differentiate traffic and put packets into queues with desired WRED settings.

```
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
Some switch chips can perform ECN marking of IP packets on the hardware level, according to RFC 3168. Hardware ECN marking is based on the WRED
mechanism, but instead of dropping IP packets, they are marked with CE (Congestion Experienced, binary 11) in the ECN field (two least significant bits in
IPv4/TOS or IPv6/TrafficClass octet). Only ECN-Capable IP packets may be marked - those with the ECN field value of ECT(1) or ECT(0)  (binary 01 or
10, respectively). Not ECN-Capable Transport packets (ECN=00) never get marked. If a packet already has the CE mark (ECN=11), it never gets cleared,
even if the device does not experience congestion.
Set ecn=yes on Tx Manager Queue to enable ECN marking.
The packet receives the CE mark if all conditions below are met:
```
The packet is either IPv4 or IPv6.
The ECN field value in IP header is either ECT(1) or ECT(0).
Egress port's Tx Queue has ecn=yes and uses shared buffers (use-shared-buffers=yes).
queueX-packet-use > queueX-shared-packet-cap or queueX-byte-use > queueX-shared-byte-cap.
```
Priority-based Flow Control (PFC)
Priority-Based Flow Control (PFC) provides lossless operation for up to eight traffic classes, so that congestion in one traffic class does not pause other
traffic classes. In addition, PFC enables co-existence of loss-sensitive traffic types with loss tolerant traffic type in the same network.
PFC-capable switch chips are complaint with IEEE 802.1Qbb PFC, meaning that the respective devices are capable of generating and responding to PFC
frames. On the triggering part, the PFC frame is sent by the source port and traffic class experiencing the congestion. The timer values of the generated
PFC frames are 0xFFFF for pause (XOFF) and 0x0 for resume (XON), and the appropriate bit in the priority enable vector is set. On the response part, the
received PFC frame pauses the specific priority queues on the port that received the PFC frame for the duration specified by the PFC frame.
In RouterOS, PFC configuration is organized in profiles, where each port can be assigned to a specific profile. A PFC profile defines the traffic classes to
enable PFC on, pause/resume thresholds to send XOFF/XON PFC frames, respectively, and whenever the assigned ports should transmit or/and receive
PFC frames.
While congestion occurs on egress ports, PFC is triggered on the ingress port. Shared buffers must be used to associate the amount of ingressed traffic
with the respective packets waiting in Tx queues. For each PFC-enabled traffic class, set use-shared-buffers=yes to the respective Tx Queues. It is also
recommended that a separate shared pool (shared-pool-index) be used for each PFC-enabled queue, especially not to mix it with PFC-disabled traffic
classes.
```
ECN marking mechanism requires the respective Tx queues to use shared buffers (use-shared-buffers=yes).
```
```
Since enabling ECN (ecn=yes) prevents ECN-capable packet drop, queue usage may exceed WRED thresholds if the traffic sender doesn't
react to congestion notification in time.
```
```
RouterOS implements 1:1 mapping between traffic classes and Tx queues. Packets with assigned traffic class 0 get enqueued in queue0, TC1 -
queue1, etc., up to TC7-Q7. Hence, the terms "traffic class" and "tx queue" are used interchangeably in this text.
```
When choosing pause and resume thresholds, consider a delay in transmitting a PFC frame and processing it by the other side. For example, device A
experienced congestion at time T, transmitted a PFC pause frame to device B, and B processed the frame and halted transmission at time T+D. During the
delta time D, device B still kept sending traffic. If device A has configured the pause threshold to 100%, it has no free buffers available, and, therefore,
packets may drop, which is unacceptable for lossless traffic classes. Lowering the pause threshold, let's say, down to 80% issues a PFC pause frame
while still having free memory to accumulate traffic during the delta time D. The same applies to resume threshold. Setting it to 0% keeps the device idle
during the delta time, lowering the overall throughput.
PFC Rx requires setting the egress rate to all associated queues to calculate pause time, even if it matches the wire speed. For example, if PFC runs on
traffic class 3, the assigned ports require the egress-rate-queue3 setting.

## Introduction
There are several types of switch chips on Routerboards and they have different sets of features. Most of them (from now on "Other") have only the basic
"Port Switching" feature, but there are a few with more features:

Notes
```
For QCA8337, Atheros8327, Atheros8316, Atheros8227, and Atheros7240 the Tx/Rx rate limits can be changed with bandwidth property on "/i
nterface ethernet" menu, see more details in the Ethernet manual. For RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190, MT7621 and MT7531 Tx
/Rx rate limit can be changed with egress-rate and ingress-rate properties on "/interface ethernet switch port" menu.
MAC addresses are learned up to the specified number, but the content of a switch host table is not available in RouterOS and static host
configuration is not supported.
Bridge HW vlan-filtering was added in the RouterOS 7.1rc1 (for RTL8367) and 7.1rc5 (for MT7621) versions. The switch does not support other et
her-type 0x88a8 or 0x9100 (only 0x8100 is supported) and no tag-stacking. Using these features will disable HW offload.

Features
Port Switching
To set up port switching on non-CRS series devices, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page.
Switch All Ports Feature
```
Port switching in RouterOS v6.41 and newer is done using the bridge configuration. Before RouterOS v6.41 port switching was done using the m
aster-port property.
```
Ether1 port on RB450G/RB435G/RB850Gx2 devices has a feature that allows it to be removed/added to the default switch group, this setting is available
on the /interface ethernet switch menu. By default ether1 port will be included in the switch group.
```
Property Description
```
```
switch-all-ports (no |
yes; Default: yes)
```
```
Changes ether1 switch group only on RB450G/RB435G/RB850Gx2 devices.
```
```
yes - ether1 is part of the switch and supports switch grouping and all other advanced Atheros8316/Atheros8327 features
including extended statistics (/interface ethernet print stats).
no - ether1 is not part of the switch, effectively making it a stand-alone ethernet port, this way increasing its throughput to
other ports in bridged and routed mode, but removing the switching possibility on this port.
```
Port Mirroring
Port mirroring lets the switch to copy all traffic that is going in and out of one port (mirror-source) and send out these copied frames to some other port (
mirror-target). This feature can be used to easily set up a 'tap' device that receives all traffic that goes in/out of some specific port. Note that mirror-
source and mirror-target ports have to belong to the same switch (see which port belongs to which switch in /interface ethernet menu). Also,
mirror-target can have a special 'cpu' value, which means that mirrored packets should be sent out to the switch chips CPU port. Port mirroring happens
independently of switching groups that have or have not been set up.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch
```
Property Description
```
```
mirror-source (name |
none; Default: none)
```
```
Selects a single mirroring source port. Ingress and egress traffic will be sent to the mirror-target port. Note that mirror-
target port has to belong to the same switch (see which port belongs to which switch in /interface ethernet menu).
```
```
mirror-target (name |
none | cpu; Default: none
)
```
```
Selects a single mirroring target port. Mirrored packets from mirror-source and mirror (see the property in rule and host
table) will be sent to the selected port.
```
```
mirror-egress-target (na
me | none; Default: none
)
```
```
Selects a single mirroring egress target port, only available on 88E6393X, 88E6191X and 88E6190 switch chips. Mirrored
packets from mirror-egress (see the property in port menu) will be sent to the selected port.
```
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch rule
```
Property Description
```
```
mirror (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send a packet copy to mirror-target port.
```
```
mirror-ports (name;
Default: )
```
```
Selects multiple mirroring target ports, only available on 88E6393X switch chip. Matched packets in the ACL rule will be
copied and sent to selected ports.
```
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch host
```
Property Description
```
```
mirror (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send a frame copy to mirror-target port from a frame with a matching MAC destination address (matching
destination or source address for CRS3xx series switches)
```
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet switch port
```
Property Description
```
```
mirror-egress (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send egress packet copy to the mirror-egress-target port, only available on 88E6393X, 88E6191X
and 88E6190 switch chips.
```
```
mirror-ingress (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send ingress packet copy to the mirror-ingress-target port, only available on 88E6393X, 88E6191X
and 88E6190 switch chips.
```
```
mirror-ingress-target (name |
none; Default: none)
```
```
Selects a single mirroring ingress target port, only available on  88E6393X, 88E6191X and 88E6190 switch chips.
Mirrored packets from mirror-ingress will be sent to the selected port.
```
Port mirroring configuration example:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set switch1 mirror-source=ether2 mirror-target=ether3
```
Port Settings
Properties under this menu are used to configure VLAN switching and filtering options for switch chips that support a VLAN Table. These properties are
only available to switch chips that have VLAN Table support, check the Switch Chip Features table to make sure your device supports such a feature.
```
Property Description
```
```
vlan-mode (check |
disabled | fallback |
secure; Default: disab
led)
```
```
Changes the VLAN lookup mechanism against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic.
```
```
disabled - disables checking against the VLAN Table completely for ingress traffic. No traffic is dropped when set on the
ingress port.
fallback - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and forwards all untagged traffic. If ingress
traffic is tagged and the egress port is not found in the VLAN table for the appropriate VLAN ID, then traffic is dropped. If a
VLAN ID is not found in the VLAN Table, then traffic is forwarded. Used to allow known VLANs only in specific ports.
check - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and drops all untagged traffic. If ingress traffic is
tagged and the egress port is not found in the VLAN table for the appropriate VLAN ID, then traffic is dropped.
secure - checks tagged traffic against the VLAN Table for ingress traffic and drops all untagged traffic. Both ingress and
egress port must be found in the VLAN Table for the appropriate VLAN ID, otherwise, traffic is dropped.
```
```
If you set mirror-source as an Ethernet port for a device with at least two switch chips and these mirror-source ports are in a single bridge while
mirror-target for both switch chips are set to send the packets to the CPU, then this will result in a loop, which can make your device
inaccessible.
```
```
Ingress traffic is considered as traffic that is being sent IN a certain port, this port is sometimes called ingress port. Egress traffic is considered
as traffic that is being sent OUT of a certain port, this port is sometimes called egress port. Distinguishing them is very important to properly set
up VLAN filtering since some properties apply only to either ingress or egress traffic.
```
```
vlan-header (add-if-
missing | always-strip
| leave-as-is; Default:
leave-as-is)
```
```
Sets action which is performed on the port for egress traffic.
```
```
add-if-missing - adds a VLAN tag on egress traffic and uses default-vlan-id from the ingress port. Should be used for
trunk ports.
always-strip - removes a VLAN tag on egress traffic. Should be used for access ports.
leave-as-is - does not add nor remove a VLAN tag on egress traffic. Should be used for hybrid ports.
```
```
default-vlan-id (auto |
integer: 0..4095;
Default: auto)
```
```
Adds a VLAN tag with the specified VLAN ID on all untagged ingress traffic on a port, should be used with vlan-header set to al
ways-strip on a port to configure the port to be the access port. For hybrid ports default-vlan-id is used to tag untagged
traffic. If two ports have the same default-vlan-id, then VLAN tag is not added since the switch chip assumes that traffic is being
forwarded between access ports.
```
VLAN Table
VLAN table specifies certain forwarding rules for packets that have a specific 802.1Q tag. Those rules are of higher priority than switch groups configured
using the Bridge Hardware Offloading feature. Basically, the table contains entries that map specific VLAN tag IDs to a group of one or more ports.
Packets with VLAN tags leave the switch chip through one or more ports that are set in the corresponding table entry. The exact logic that controls how
packets with VLAN tags are treated is controlled by a vlan-mode parameter that is changeable per switch port.
VLAN ID based forwarding takes into account the MAC addresses dynamically learned or manually added in the host table. QCA8337 and Atheros8327
switch-chips also support Independent VLAN Learning (IVL) which does the learning based on both - MAC addresses and VLAN IDs, thus allowing the
same MAC to be used in multiple VLANs.
Packets without VLAN tag are treated just as if they had a VLAN tag with port default-vlan-id. If vlan-mode=check or vlan=mode=secure is
configured, to forward packets without VLAN tags you have to add an entry to the VLAN table with the same VLAN ID according to default-vlan-id.
```
Property Description
```
```
disabled (no | yes; Default: no) Enables or disables switch VLAN entry.
```
```
independent-learning (no | yes;
Default: yes)
```
```
Whether to use shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) or independent-VLAN-learning (IVL).
```
```
ports (name; Default: none) Interface member list for the respective VLAN. This setting accepts comma-separated values. e.g. ports=eth
er1,ether2.
```
```
switch (name; Default: none) Name of the switch for which the respective VLAN entry is intended for.
```
```
vlan-id (integer: 0..4095; Default: ) The VLAN ID for certain switch port configurations.
```
VLAN Forwarding
Both vlan-mode and vlan-header along with the VLAN Table can be used to configure VLAN tagging, untagging and filtering, multiple combinations
are possible, each achieving a different result. Below you can find a table of what kind of traffic is going to be sent out through an egress port when a
certain traffic is received on an ingress port for each VLAN Mode.
NOTES:
```
L - vlan-header is set to leave-as-is
S - vlan-header set to always-strip
A - vlan-header set to add-if-missing
U - Untagged traffic is sent out
T - Tagged traffic is sent out, a tag is already present on the ingress port
TA - Tagged traffic is sent out, a tag was added on the ingress port
DI - Traffic is dropped on ingress port because of mode selected in vlan-mode
```
```
On QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch chips, a default vlan-header=leave-as-is property should be used. The switch chip will determine
which ports are access ports by using the default-vlan-id property. The default-vlan-id should only be used on access/hybrid ports to
specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
```
```
Devices with MT7621, MT7531, RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips support HW offloaded vlan-filtering in RouterOS v7.
VLAN-related configuration on the "/interface ethernet switch" menu is not available.
```
```

Host Table
```
The tables above are meant for more advanced configurations and to double-check your understanding of how packets will be processed with
each VLAN related property.
```
The host table represents switch chip's internal MAC address to port mapping. It can contain two kinds of entries: dynamic and static. Dynamic entries get
added automatically, this is also called a learning process: when switch chip receives a packet from a certain port, it adds the packet's source MAC
address and port it received the packet from to the host table, so when a packet comes in with the same destination MAC address, it knows to which port it
should forward the packet. If the destination MAC address is not present in the host table (so-called unknown-unicast traffic) then it forwards the packet to
all ports in the group. Dynamic entries take about 5 minutes to time out. Learning is enabled only on ports that are configured as part of the switch group,
so you won't see dynamic entries if you have not set up port switching. Also, you can add static entries that take over dynamic if a dynamic entry with the
same MAC address already exists. Since port switching is configured using a bridge with hardware offloading, any static entries created on one table
(either bridge host or switch host) will appear on the opposite table as a dynamic entry. Adding a static entry on the switch host table will provide access to
some more functionality that is controlled via the following params:

Rule Table
Rule table is a very powerful tool allowing wire-speed packet filtering, forwarding and VLAN tagging based on L2, L3 and L4 protocol header field
conditions. The menu contains an ordered list of rules just like in /ip firewall filter, so ACL rules are checked for each packet until a match has
been found. If multiple rules can match, then only the first rule will be triggered. A rule without any action parameters is a rule to accept the packet.
Each rule contains a conditions part and an action part. The action part is controlled by the following parameters:
```
Every switch chip has a finite number of MAC addresses it can store on the chip, see the Introduction table for a specific host table size. Once a
host table is full, different techniques can be utilized to cope with the situation, for example, the switch can remove older entries to free space for
more recent MAC addresses (used on QCA-8337 and Atheros-8327 switch chips), another option is to simply ignore the new MAC addresses
and only remove entries after a timeout has passed (used on Atheros8316, Atheros8227, Atheros-7240, ICPlus175D and Realtek-RTL8367
switch chips), the last option is a combination of the previous two - only allow a certain amount of entries to be renewed and keep the other host
portion intact till the timeout (used on MediaTek-MT7621, MT7531 switch chip). These techniques cannot be changed with configuration.
```
```
For Atheros8316, Atheros8227 and Atheros-7240 switch chips, the switch-cpu port will always participate in the host learning process when at
least one hardware offloaded bridge port is active on the switching group. It will cause the switch-cpu port to learn MAC addresses from non-
HW offloaded interfaces. This might cause packet loss when a single bridge contains HW and non-HW offloaded interfaces. Also, packet loss
might appear when a duplicate MAC address is used on the same switching group regardless if hosts are located on different logical networks.
It is recommended to use HW offloading only when all bridge ports can use HW offloaded or keep it disabled on all switch ports when one or
more bridge ports cannot be configured with HW offloading.

Port isolation
Port isolation provides the possibility to divide (isolate) certain parts of your network, this might be useful when you need to make sure that certain devices
cannot access other devices, this can be done by isolating switch ports. Port isolation only works between ports that are members of the same switch.
Switch port isolation is available on all switch chips since RouterOS v6.43.
```
Property Description
```
```
forwarding-override (interface;
Default: )
```
```
Forces ingress traffic to be forwarded to a specific interface. Multiple interfaces can be specified by separating
them with a comma.
```
Private VLAN
In some scenarios, you might need to forward all traffic to an uplink port while all other ports are isolated from each other. This kind of setup is called Privat
e VLAN configuration, the Switch will forward all Ethernet frames directly to the uplink port allowing the Router to filter unwanted packets and limit access
between devices that are behind switch ports.
```
IPv4 and IPv6 specific conditions cannot be present in the same rule.
```
```
Because the rule table is processed entirely in switch chips hardware, there is a limitation to how many rules you may have. Depending on the
number of conditions (MAC layer, IP layer, IPv6, L4 layer) you use in your rules, the number of active rules may vary from 8 to 32 for
Atheros8316 switch chip, from 8 to 16 for Atheros8327/QCA8337 switch chip and from 42 to 256 for 88E6393X switch chip. You can always do /
interface ethernet switch rule print after modifying your rule set to see that no rules at the end of the list are 'invalid' which means
those rules did not fit into the switch chip.
```
```
(R/M)STP will only work properly in PVLAN setups, (R/M)STP will not work properly in setups, where there are multiple isolated switch groups,
because switch groups might not properly receive BPDUs and therefore fail to detect network loops.
```
```
The forwarding-override property affects ingress traffic only. Switch ports that do not have the forwarding-override specified can
send packets through all switch ports.
```
```
Switch chips with a VLAN table support (QCA8337, Atheros8327, Atheros8316, Atheros8227 and Atheros7240) can override the port isolation
configuration when enabling a VLAN lookup on the switch port (the vlan-mode is set to fallback, check or secure). If additional port
isolation is needed between ports on the same VLAN, a switch rule with a new-dst-ports property can be implemented. Other devices without
switch rule support cannot overcome this limitation.
```
To configure switch port isolation, you need to switch all required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=sfp1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
```
Override the egress port for each switch port that needs to be isolated (excluding the uplink port):
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
set ether1 forwarding-override=sfp1
set ether2 forwarding-override=sfp1
set ether3 forwarding-override=sfp1
```
Isolated switch groups
In some scenarios you might need to isolate a group of devices from other groups, this can be done using the switch port isolation feature. This is useful
when you have multiple networks but you want to use a single switch, with port isolation you can allow certain switch ports to be able to communicate
through only a set of switch ports. In this example, devices on ether1-3 will only be able to communicate with devices that are on ether1-3, while devices on
ether4-5 will only be able to communicate with devices on ether4-5 (ether1-3 is not able to communicate with ether4-5)
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading
because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
It is possible to set multiple uplink ports for a single switch chip, this can be done by specifying multiple interfaces and separating them with a
comma.
```
```
Port isolation is only available between ports that are members of the same switch.
```
To configure isolated switch groups you must first switch all ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
Then specify in the forwarding-override property all ports that you want to be in the same isolated switch group (except the port on which you are
applying the property), for example, to create an isolated switch group for A devices:
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
set ether1 forwarding-override=ether2,ether3
set ether2 forwarding-override=ether1,ether3
set ether3 forwarding-override=ether1,ether2
```
To create an isolated switch group for B devices:
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading
because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
set ether4 forwarding-override=ether5
set ether5 forwarding-override=ether4
```
CPU Flow Control
All switch chips have a special port that is called switchX-cpu, this is the CPU port for a switch chip, it is meant to forward traffic from a switch chip to the
CPU, such a port is required for management traffic and routing features. By default the switch chip ensures that this special CPU port is not congested
and sends out Pause Frames when link capacity is exceeded to make sure the port is not oversaturated, this feature is called CPU Flow Control. Without
this feature packets that might be crucial for routing or management purposes might get dropped.
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to disable the CPU Flow Control feature on some devices that are using one of the following switch chips:
Atheros8227, QCA8337, Atheros8327, Atheros7240 or Atheros8316. Other switch chips have this feature enabled by default and cannot be changed. To
disable CPU Flow Control use the following command:
```
/interface ethernet switch set switch1 cpu-flow-control=no
```
Statistics
Some switch chips are capable of reporting statistics, this can be useful to monitor how many packets are sent to the CPU from the built-in switch chip.
These statistics can also be used to monitor CPU Flow Control. You can find an example of the switch chip's statistics below:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface ethernet switch print stats

Some devices have multiple CPU cores that are directly connected to a built-in switch chip using separate data lanes. These devices can report which data
lane was used to forward the packet from or to the CPU port from the switch chip. For such devices an extra line is added for each row, the first line
represents data that was sent using the first data lane, the second line represents data that was sent using the second data line, and so on. You can find
an example of the switch chip's statistics for a device with multiple data lanes connecting the CPU and the built-in switch chip:

Setup Examples
VLAN Example 1 (Trunk and Access Ports)
```
Make sure you have added all needed interfaces to the VLAN table when using secure vlan-mode. For routing functions to work properly on
the same device through ports that use secure vlan-mode, you will need to allow access to the CPU from those ports, this can be done by
adding the switchX-cpu interface itself to the VLAN table. Examples can be found in the Management port section.
```
```
It is possible to use the built-in switch chip and the CPU at the same time to create a Switch-Router setup, where a device acts as a switch and
as a router at the same time. You can find a configuration example in the Switch-Router guide.
```
```
When allowing access to the CPU, you are allowing access from a certain port to the actual router/switch, this is not always desirable. Make
sure you implement proper firewall filter rules to secure your device when access to the CPU is allowed from a certain VLAN ID and port, use
firewall filter rules to allow access to only certain services.
```
```
Devices with MT7621, MT7531, RTL8367, 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips support HW offloaded vlan-filtering in RouterOS v7.
VLAN-related configuration on the "/interface ethernet switch" menu is not available.
```
```
For VLAN related matchers or VLAN related action parameters to work on 88E6393X switch chip, you need to enable vlan-filtering on the bridge
interface and make sure that hardware offloading is enabled on those ports, otherwise, these parameters will not have any effect..
```
RouterBOARDs with Atheros switch chips can be used for 802.1Q Trunking. This feature in RouterOS v6 is supported by QCA8337, Atheros8316,
Atheros8327, Atheros8227 and Atheros7240 switch chips. In this example, ether3, ether4, and ether5 interfaces are access ports, while ether2 is a trunk
port. VLAN IDs for each access port: ether3 - 400, ether4 - 300, ether5 - 200.
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
Add VLAN table entries to allow frames with specific VLAN IDs between ports:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether3 switch=switch1 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether4 switch=switch1 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=400
```
Assign vlan-mode and vlan-header mode for each port and also default-vlan-id on ingress for each access port:
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading
because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=add-if-missing
set ether3 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=200
set ether4 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=300
set ether5 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=always-strip default-vlan-id=400
```
```
Setting vlan-mode=secure ensures strict use of the VLAN table.
Setting vlan-header=always-strip for access ports removes the VLAN header from the frame when it leaves the switch chip.
Setting vlan-header=add-if-missing for trunk port adds VLAN header to untagged frames.
default-vlan-id specifies what VLAN ID is added for untagged ingress traffic of the access port.
```
VLAN Example 2 (Trunk and Hybrid Ports)
VLAN Hybrid ports can forward both tagged and untagged traffic. This configuration is supported only by some Gigabit switch chips (QCA8337,
Atheros8327).
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
```
On QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch chips, a default vlan-header=leave-as-is property should be used. The switch chip will determine
which ports are access ports by using the default-vlan-id property. The default-vlan-id should only be used on access/hybrid ports to
specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
```
Add VLAN table entries to allow frames with specific VLAN IDs between ports.
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=400
```
In the switch port menu set vlan-mode on all ports and also default-vlan-id on planned hybrid ports:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is
set ether3 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=200
set ether4 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=300
set ether5 vlan-mode=secure vlan-header=leave-as-is default-vlan-id=400
```
```
vlan-mode=secure will ensure strict use of the VLAN table.
default-vlan-id will define VLAN for untagged ingress traffic on the port.
In QCA8337 and Atheros8327 chips when vlan-mode=secure is used, it ignores switch port vlan-header options. VLAN table entries handle
all the egress tagging/untagging and works as vlan-header=leave-as-is on all ports. It means what comes in tagged, goes out tagged as
well, only default-vlan-id frames are untagged at the egress port.
```
Management access configuration
In these examples, there will be shown examples for multiple scenarios, but each of these scenarios requires you to have switched ports. Below you can
find how to switch multiple ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 hw=yes
```
In these examples, it will be assumed that ether1 is the trunk port and ether2 is the access port, for configuration as the following:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=100
```
Tagged
To make the device accessible only from a certain VLAN, you need to create a new VLAN interface on the bridge interface and assign an IP address to it:
```
/interface vlan
add name=MGMT vlan-id=99 interface=bridge1
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading
because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading
because specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
Specify from which interfaces it is allowed to access the device:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=99
```
When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable vlan-mode=secure to limit access to the CPU:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```
Untagged
To make the device accessible from the access port, create a VLAN interface with the same VLAN ID as set in default-vlan-id, for example, VLAN
100, and add an IP address to it:
```
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN100 vlan-id=100 interface=bridge1
/ip address
add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=VLAN100
```
Specify which access (untagged) ports are allowed to access the CPU:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=100
```
When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable vlan-mode=secure to limit access to the CPU:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set ether2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```
Untagged from tagged port
It is possible to allow access to the device from the trunk (tagged) port with untagged traffic. To do so, assign an IP address on the bridge interface:
```
/ip address
add address=10.0.0.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
```
Only specify trunk ports in this VLAN table entry, it is not possible to allow access to the CPU with tagged traffic through an access port since
the access port will tag all ingress traffic with the specified default-vlan-id value.
```
```
Most commonly an access (untagged) port is accompanied by a trunk (tagged) port. In case of untagged access to the CPU, you are forced to
specify both the access port and the trunk port, this gives access to the CPU from the trunk port as well. Not always this is desired and a
Firewall might be required on top of VLAN filtering.
```
```
To setup the management port using untagged traffic on a device with the Atheros7240 switch chip, you will need to set vlan-header=add-
if-missing for the CPU port.
```
Specify which ports are allowed to access the CPU. Use vlan-id that is used in default-vlan-id for switch-cpu and trunk ports, by default it is set to
0 or 1.
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=1
```
When the VLAN table is configured, you can enable vlan-mode=secure to limit access to the CPU:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 default-vlan-id=1 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu default-vlan-id=1 vlan-header=leave-as-is vlan-mode=secure
```
Inter-VLAN routing
Many MikroTik's devices come with a built-in switch chip that can be used to greatly improve overall throughput when configured properly. Devices with a
switch chip can be used as a router and a switch at the same time, this gives you the possibility to use a single device instead of multiple devices for your
network.
For this type of setup to work, you must switch all required ports together
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
```
Create a VLAN interface for each VLAN ID and assign an IP address to it:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN20 vlan-id=20
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=VLAN10
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN20
```
Setup a DHCP Server for each VLAN:
```
This configuration example is not possible for devices with the Atheros8316 and Atheros7240 switch chips. For devices with QCA8337 and Ather
os8327 switch chips, it is possible to use any other default-vlan-id as long as it stays the same on switch-cpu and trunk ports. For devices
with Atheros8227 switch chip only default-vlan-id=0 can be used and the trunk port must use vlan-header=leave-as-is.
```
```
/ip pool
add name=POOL10 ranges=192.168.10.100-192.168.10.200
add name=POOL20 ranges=192.168.20.100-192.168.20.200
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=POOL10 disabled=no interface=VLAN10 name=DHCP10
add address-pool=POOL20 disabled=no interface=VLAN20 name=DHCP20
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.10.1
add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.20.1
```
Enable NAT on the device:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1
```
Add each port to the VLAN table and allow these ports to access the CPU to make DHCP and routing work:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add independent-learning=yes ports=ether2,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add independent-learning=yes ports=ether3,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=20
```
Specify each port to be an access port, and enable secure VLAN mode on each port and on the switch1-cpu port:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set ether3 default-vlan-id=20 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu vlan-mode=secure
```
If your device has a switch rule table, then you can limit access between VLANs on a hardware level. As soon as you add an IP address on the VLAN
interface you enable inter-VLAN routing, but this can be limited on a hardware level while preserving DHCP Server and other router-related services. To do
so, use these ACL rules. With this type of configuration, you can achieve isolated port groups using VLANs.
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add dst-address=192.168.20.0/24 new-dst-ports="" ports=ether2 switch=switch1
add dst-address=192.168.10.0/24 new-dst-ports="" ports=ether3 switch=switch1
```

On QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch chips, a default vlan-header=leave-as-is property should be used. The switch chip will determine
which ports are access ports by using the default-vlan-id property. The default-vlan-id should only be used on access/hybrid ports to
specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.

## Summary
Standards: IEEE 802.1Q, IEEE 802.1ad
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a Layer 2 method that allows multiple Virtual LANs on a single physical interface (ethernet, wireless, etc.), giving the
ability to segregate LANs efficiently.
You can use MikroTik RouterOS (as well as Cisco IOS, Linux, and other router systems) to mark these packets as well as to accept and route marked
ones.
As VLAN works on OSI Layer 2, it can be used just like any other network interface without any restrictions. VLAN successfully passes through regular
Ethernet bridges.
You can also transport VLANs over wireless links and put multiple VLAN interfaces on a single wireless interface. Note that as VLAN is not a full tunnel
protocol (i.e., it does not have additional fields to transport MAC addresses of sender and recipient), the same limitation applies to bridging over VLAN as
to bridging plain wireless interfaces. In other words, while wireless clients may participate in VLANs put on wireless interfaces, it is not possible to have
VLAN put on a wireless interface in station mode bridged with any other interface.

## 802.1Q
The most commonly used protocol for Virtual LANs (VLANs) is IEEE 802.1Q. It is a standardized encapsulation protocol that defines how to insert a four-
byte VLAN identifier into the Ethernet header.
Each VLAN is treated as a separate subnet. It means that by default, a host in a specific VLAN cannot communicate with a host that is a member of
another VLAN, although they are connected to the same switch. So if you want inter-VLAN communication you need a router. RouterOS supports up to
4094 VLAN interfaces, each with a unique VLAN ID, per interface. VLAN priorities may also be used and manipulated.
When the VLAN extends over more than one switch, the inter-switch link has to become a 'trunk', where packets are tagged to indicate which VLAN they
belong to. A trunk carries the traffic of multiple VLANs; it is like a point-to-point link that carries tagged packets between switches or between a switch and
router.

## Q-in-Q
Original 802.1Q allows only one VLAN header, Q-in-Q on the other hand allows two or more VLAN headers. In RouterOS, Q-in-Q can be configured by
adding one VLAN interface over another. Example:
```
/interface vlan
add name=vlan1 vlan-id=11 interface=ether1
add name=vlan2 vlan-id=12 interface=vlan1
```
```
The IEEE 802.1Q standard has reserved VLAN IDs with special use cases, the following VLAN IDs should not be used in generic VLAN setups:
0, 1, 4095
```
If any packet is sent over the 'vlan2' interface, two VLAN tags will be added to the Ethernet header - '11' and '12'.

MTU should be set to 1500 bytes same as on Ethernet interfaces. But this may not work with some Ethernet cards that do not support receiving
/transmitting of full-size Ethernet packets with VLAN header added (1500 bytes data + 4 bytes VLAN header + 14 bytes Ethernet header). In this
situation, MTU 1496 can be used, but note that this will cause packet fragmentation if larger packets have to be sent over the interface. At the
same time remember that MTU 1496 may cause problems if path MTU discovery is not working properly between source and destination.
```
There are multiple possible configurations that you can use, but each configuration type is designed for a special set of devices since some configuration
methods will give you the benefits of the built-in switch chip and gain larger throughput. Check the Basic VLAN switching guide to see which configuration
to use for each type of device to gain maximum possible throughput and compatibility, the guide shows how to set up a very basic VLAN trunk/access port
configuration.
There are some other ways to set up VLAN tagging or VLAN switching, but the recommended way is to use Bridge VLAN Filtering. Make sure you have
not used any known Layer2 misconfigurations.
Layer3 VLAN examples
Simple VLAN routing
Let us assume that we have several MikroTik routers connected to a hub. Remember that a hub is an OSI physical layer device (if there is a hub between
routers, then from the L3 point of view it is the same as an Ethernet cable connection between them). For simplification assume that all routers are
connected to the hub using the ether1 interface and have assigned IP addresses as illustrated in the figure below. Then on each of them the VLAN
interface is created.
Configuration for R2 and R4 is shown below:
R2:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface vlan> add name=VLAN2 vlan-id=2 interface=ether1 disabled=no
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface vlan> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running, S - slave
# NAME MTU ARP VLAN-ID INTERFACE
0 R VLAN2 1500 enabled 2 ether1
```

### R4:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface vlan> add name=VLAN2 vlan-id=2 interface=ether1 disabled=no
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface vlan> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running, S - slave
# NAME MTU ARP VLAN-ID INTERFACE
0 R VLAN2 1500 enabled 2 ether1
```
The next step is to assign IP addresses to the VLAN interfaces.
R2:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> add address=10.10.10.3/24 interface=VLAN2
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS NETWORK BROADCAST INTERFACE
0 10.0.1.4/24 10.0.1.0 10.0.1.255 ether1
1 10.20.0.1/24 10.20.0.0 10.20.0.255 pc1
2 10.10.10.3/24 10.10.10.0 10.10.10.255 vlan2
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address>
```

### R4:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> add address=10.10.10.5/24 interface=VLAN2
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS NETWORK BROADCAST INTERFACE
0 10.0.1.5/24 10.0.1.0 10.0.1.255 ether1
1 10.30.0.1/24 10.30.0.0 10.30.0.255 pc2
2 10.10.10.5/24 10.10.10.0 10.10.10.255 vlan2
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address>
```
At this point, it should be possible to ping router R4 from router R2 and vice versa:
```
"Ping from R2 to R4:"
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> /ping 10.10.10.5
```
```
10.10.10.5 64 byte ping: ttl=255 time=4 ms
```
```
10.10.10.5 64 byte ping: ttl=255 time=1 ms
```
```
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
```
```
round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2.5/4 ms
```
```
"From R4 to R2:"
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> /ping 10.10.10.3
10.10.10.3 64 byte ping: ttl=255 time=6 ms
10.10.10.3 64 byte ping: ttl=255 time=1 ms
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 1/3.5/6 ms
```
To make sure if the VLAN setup is working properly, try to ping R1 from R2. If pings are timing out then VLANs are successfully isolated.
```
"From R2 to R1:"
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip address> /ping 10.10.10.2
10.10.10.2 ping timeout
10.10.10.2 ping timeout
3 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
```
InterVLAN routing
If separate VLANs are implemented on a switch, then a router is required to provide communication between VLANs. A switch works at OSI layer 2 so it
uses only the Ethernet header to forward and does not check the IP header. For this reason, we must use the router that is working as a gateway for each
VLAN. Without a router, a host is unable to communicate outside of its own VLAN. The routing process between VLANs described above is called inter-
VLAN communication.
To illustrate inter-VLAN communication, we will create a trunk that will carry traffic from three VLANs (VLAN2 and VLAN3, VLAN4) across a single link
between a Mikrotik router and a manageable switch that supports VLAN trunking.
Each VLAN has its own separate subnet (broadcast domain) as we see in the figure above:
```
VLAN 2 – 10.10.20.0/24;
VLAN 3 – 10.10.30.0/24;
VLAN 4 – 10.10.40.0./24.
```
VLAN configuration on most switches is straightforward, we need to define which ports are members of the VLANs and define a 'trunk' port that can carry
tagged frames between the switch and the router.
Create VLAN interfaces:
```
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN2 vlan-id=2 interface=ether1 disabled=no
add name=VLAN3 vlan-id=3 interface=ether1 disabled=no
add name=VLAN4 vlan-id=4 interface=ether1 disabled=no
```
Add IP addresses to VLANs:
```
/ip address
add address=10.10.20.1/24 interface=VLAN2
add address=10.10.30.1/24 interface=VLAN3
add address=10.10.40.1/24 interface=VLAN4
```
RouterOS /32 and IP unnumbered addresses
In RouterOS, to create a point-to-point tunnel with addresses you have to use the address with a network mask of '/32' that effectively brings you the same
features as some vendors unnumbered IP address.
There are 2 routers RouterA and RouterB where each is part of networks 10.22.0.0/24 and 10.23.0.0/24 respectively and to connect these routers using
VLANs as a carrier with the following configuration:
RouterA:
```
/ip address add address=10.22.0.1/24 interface=ether1
/interface vlan add interface=ether2 vlan-id=1 name=vlan1
/ip address add address=10.22.0.1/32 interface=vlan1 network=10.23.0.1
/ip route add gateway=10.23.0.1 dst-address=10.23.0.0/24
```
RouterB:
```
/ip address add address=10.23.0.1/24 interface=ether1
/interface vlan add interface=ether2 vlan-id=1 name=vlan1
/ip address add address=10.23.0.1/32 interface=vlan1 network=10.22.0.1
/ip route add gateway=10.22.0.1 dst-address=10.22.0.0/24
```

## Introduction
Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) is a tunneling protocol designed to solve the problem of limited VLAN IDs (4096) in IEEE 802.1Q, and it is
described by IETF RFC 7348. With VXLAN the size of the identifier is expanded to 24 bits (16777216). It creates a Layer 2 overlay scheme on a Layer 3
network and the protocol runs over UDP. RouterOS VXLAN interface supports IPv4 or IPv6 (since version 7.6), but dual-stack is not supported.
Only devices within the same VXLAN segment can communicate with each other. Each VXLAN segment is identified through a 24-bit segment ID, termed
the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). Unlike most tunnels, a VXLAN is a 1-to-N network, not just point-to-point. VXLAN endpoints, which terminate VXLAN
tunnels are known as VXLAN tunnel endpoints (VTEPs). RouterOS only supports statically configured remote VTEPs. When unicast traffic needs to be
sent over VXLAN, a device can learn the IP address of the other endpoint dynamically in a manner similar to a learning bridge, and forward traffic only to
the necessary VTEP. For traffic that needs to be flooded (broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast) to all VTEPs on the same segment, VXLAN can use
multicast or unicast with head-end replication to send one replica for every remote VTEP.

## Configuration options
This section describes the VXLAN interface and VTEP configuration options.
Sub-menu: /interface vxlan
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-fast-path (
yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Whether to allow Fast Path processing. Fragmented and flooded packets over VXLAN are redirected via a slow path. Fast Path is
disabled for VXLAN interface that uses IPv6 VTEP version or VRF. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.8.
```
```
arp (disabled |
enabled | local-
proxy-arp |
proxy-arp |
reply-only;
Default: enabled
)
```
```
Address Resolution Protocol setting
```
```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface
proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which
are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore
for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
```
```
arp-timeout (aut
o | integer;
Default: auto)
```
```
How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from IP. Value auto equals to the value of arp-
timeout in IP/Settings, default is the 30s.
```
```
comment (string
; Default: )
```
```
Short description of the interface.
```
```
disabled (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
Changes whether the interface is disabled.
```
```
VXLAN creates a 50-byte overhead for IPv4 and a 70-byte overhead for IPv6. When configuring VXLAN, it is recommended to ensure that the
size of the encapsulated Ethernet frame does not exceed the MTU of the underlying network, by configuring the MTU accordingly or by limiting
the size of the Ethernet frames.
```
```
dont-fragment (
disabled |
enabled | inherit
; Default: disabl
ed)
```
```
The Don't Fragment (DF) flag controls whether a packet can be broken into smaller packets, called fragments, before being sent over
a network. When configuring VXLAN, this setting determines the presence of the DF flag on the outer IPv4 header and can control
packet fragmentation if the encapsulated packet exceeds the outgoing interface MTU. This setting has three options:
```
```
disabled - the DF flag is not set on the outer IPv4 header, which means that packets can be fragmented if they are too large to
be sent over the outgoing interface. This also allows packet fragmentation when VXLAN uses IPv6 underlay.
enabled - the DF flag is always set on the outer IPv4 header, which means that packets will not be fragmented and will be
dropped if they exceed the outgoing interface's MTU. This also avoids packet fragmentation when VXLAN uses IPv6 underlay.
inherit - The DF flag on the outer IPv4 header is based on the inner IPv4 DF flag. If the inner IPv4 header has the DF flag set,
the outer IPv4 header will also have it set. If the packet exceeds the outgoing interface's MTU and DF is set, it will be dropped. If
the inner packet is non-IP, the outer IPv4 header will not have the DF flag set and packets can be fragmented. If the inner packet
is IPv6, the outer IPv4 header will always set the DF flag and packets cannot be fragmented. Note that when VXLAN uses IPv6
underlay, this setting does not have any effect and is treated the same as disabled.
```
```
The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.8.
```
```
group (IPv4 |
IPv6; Default: )
```
```
When specified, a multicast group address can be used to forward broadcast, unknown-unicast, and multicast traffic between VTEPs.
This property requires specifying the interface setting. The interface will use IGMP or MLD to join the specified multicast group,
make sure to add the necessary PIM and IGMP/MDL configuration. When this property is set, the vteps-ip-version automatically
gets updated to the used multicast IP version.
```
```
interface (name;
Default: )
```
```
Interface name used for multicast forwarding. This property requires specifying the group setting.
```
```
local-address (I
Pv4 | IPv6;
Default: )
```
```
Specifies the local source address for the VXLAN interface. If not set, one IP address of the egress interface will be selected as a
source address for VXLAN packets. When the property is set, the vteps-ip-version automatically gets updated to the used local
IP version. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.7.
```
```
mac-address (M
AC; Default: )
```
```
Static MAC address of the interface. A randomly generated MAC address will be assigned when not specified.
```
```
max-fdb-size (in
teger: 1..65535;
Default:  4096 )
```
```
Limits the maximum number of MAC addresses that VXLAN can store in the forwarding database (FDB).
```
```
mtu (integer;
Default:  1500 )
```
```
For the maximum transmission unit, the VXLAN interface will set MTU to 1500 by default. The l2mtu will be set automatically
according to the associated interface (subtracting 50 bytes corresponding to the VXLAN header). If no interface is specified, the l2
mtu value of 65535 is used. The l2mtu cannot be changed.
```
```
name (text;
Default: vxlan1)
```
```
Name of the interface.
```
```
port (integer: 1..
65535 ; Default:
4789 )
```
```
Used UDP port number.
```
```
ttl (auto |
integer: 0..255;
Default: auto)
```
```
Specifies the TTL value to use in outgoing packets. By default, the TTL is set to 64 when using the auto option. However, if VXLAN
is using a multicast underlay network, the default TTL is set to 1. If the multicast network involves routing, you will need to increase
the TTL to a higher value.
```
```
vni (integer: 1..
16777216 ;
Default: )
```
```
VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).
```
```
vrf (name;
Default: main)
```
```
Set VRF for the VXLAN interface on which the VTEPs listen and make connections. VRF is not supported when using interface
and multicast group settings. The same UDP port cannot be used in multiple routing tables at the same time. The setting is
available since RouterOS version 7.7.
```
```
vteps-ip-version
(ipv4 | ipv6;
Default: ipv4)
```
```
Used IP protocol version for statically configured VTEPs. The RouterOS VXLAN interface does not support dual-stack, any
configured remote VTEPs with the opposite IP version will be ignored. When multicast group or local-address properties are set,
the vteps-ip-version automatically gets updated to the used IP version. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.6.
```
Sub-menu: /interface vxlan vteps

Configuration example
This configuration example creates a single VXLAN tunnel between two statically configured VTEP endpoints.
First, create VXLAN interfaces on both routers.
```
/interface vxlan
add name=vxlan1 port=4789 vni=10
```
Then configure VTEPs on both routers with respective IPv4 destination addresses. Both devices should have an active route toward the destination
address.
```
# Router1
/interface vxlan vteps
add interface=vxlan1 remote-ip=192.168.10.10
```
```

## Introduction
Many MikroTik devices come with built-in switch chips that usually have an option to do VLAN switching on a hardware level, this means that you can
achieve wire-speed performance using VLANs if a proper configuration method is used. The configuration method changes across different models, this
guide will focus on setting up a basic trunk/access port with a management port from the trunk port using different devices with the right configuration to
achieve the best performance and to fully utilize the available hardware components.

```
More detailed examples can be found here.
Other devices without a built-in switch chip
It is possible to do VLAN filtering using the CPU, there are multiple ways to do it, but it is highly recommended to use bridge VLAN filtering.
```
Not all devices with a switch chip are capable of VLAN switching on a hardware level, check the supported features for each switch chip, the
compatibility table can be found here. If a device has VLAN table support, then it is capable of VLAN switching using the built-in switch chip.
You can check the device's switch chip either in the provided link or by using /interface ethernet switch print
```
```
On QCA8337 and Atheros8327 switch chips, a default vlan-header=leave-as-is property should be used. The switch chip will determine
which ports are access ports by using the default-vlan-id property. The default-vlan-id should only be used on access/hybrid ports to
specify which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to.
```
```
This type of configuration should be used on RouterBOARD series devices, this includes RB4xx, RB9xx, RB2011, RB3011, hAP, hEX, cAP, and
other devices.
```
```
By default, the bridge interface is configured with protocol-mode set to rstp. For some devices, this can disable hardware offloading because
specific switch chips do not support this feature. See the Bridge Hardware Offloading section with supported features.
```
```
For devices that have multiple switch chips (for example, RB2011, RB3011, RB1100), each switch chip is only able to switch VLAN traffic
between ports that are on the same switch chip, VLAN filtering will not work on a hardware level between ports that are on different switch
chips, this means you should not add all ports to a single bridge if you are intending to use VLAN filtering using the switch chip, VLANs between
switch chips will not get filtered. You can connect a single cable between both switch chips to work around this hardware limitation, another
option is to use Bridge VLAN Filtering, but it disables hardware offloading (and lowers the total throughput).

## Introduction
IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) snooping allow the bridge to listen to IGMP/MLD communication and
make forwarding decisions for multicast traffic based on the received information. By default, bridges are flooding multicast traffic to all bridge ports just like
broadcast traffic, which might not always be the best scenario (e.g. for multicast video traffic or SDVoE applications). The IGMP/MLD snooping tries to
solve the problem by forwarding the multicast traffic only to ports where clients are subscribed to, see an IGMP/MLD network concept below. RouterOS
bridge can process IGMP v1/v2/v3 and MLD v1/v2 packets. The implemented bridge IGMP/MLD snooping is based on RFC4541, and IGMP/MLD
protocols are specified on RFC1112 (IGMPv1) RFC2236 (IGMPv2), RFC3376 (IGMPv3), RFC2710 (MLDv1), RFC3810 (MLDv2).
```
Source-specific multicast forwarding is not supported for IGMP v3 and MLD v2.
```
The bridge will process the IGMP/MLD messages only when igmp-snooping is enabled. Additionally, the bridge should have an active IPv6 address to
process MLD packets. At first, the bridge does not restrict the multicast traffic and all multicast packets get flooded. Once IGMP/MLD querier is detected by
receiving an IGMP/MLD query message (the query message can be received by an external multicast router or locally by bridge interface with enabled mul
ticast-querier), only then the bridge will start to restrict unknown IP multicast traffic and forward the known multicast from the multicast database
(MDB). The IGMP and MLD querier detection is independent, which means that detecting only IGMP querier will not affect IPv6 multicast forwarding and
vice versa. The querier detection also does not restrict the forwarding of non-IP and link-local multicast groups, like 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1.
Configuration options
This section describes the IGMP and MLD snooping bridge configuration options.
Sub-menu: /interface bridge
```
Property Description
```
```
CRS3xx series devices with Marvell-98DX3236, Marvell-98DX224S or Marvell-98DX226S switch chips are not able to distinguish non-IP/IPv4
/IPv6 multicast packets once IGMP or MLD querier is detected. It means that the switch will stop forwarding all unknown non-IP/IPv4/IPv6
multicast traffic when the querier is detected. This does not apply to certain link-local multicast address ranges, like 224.0.0.0/24 or ff02::1.
```
igmp-snooping (yes
| no; Default: no)
```
Enables IGMP and MLD snooping.
```
igmp-version (2 | 3;
Default:  2 )
```
Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP
querier. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
last-member-interval
(time; Default: 1s)
```
When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes to a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the bridge
will send group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes the response
time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (last-member-interval * last-
member-query-count), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).
```
```
If the bridge port is configured with fast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.
```
```
This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
last-member-query-
count (integer: 0..
4294967295 ;
Default:  2 )
```
How many times should last-member-interval pass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain
multicast stream. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
membership-interval
(time; Default: 4m20s
)
```
The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are received
on a bridge port. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
mld-version (1 | 2;
Default:  1 )
```
Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an MLD
querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address, igmp-snooping and multicast-
querier is set to yes.
```
multicast-querier (ye
s | no; Default: no)
```
Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices respond
with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.
```
```
By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge to generate IGMP/MLD general membership
queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network.
Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries will
timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.
```
```
Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with IPv4 0.0.0.0 source address,
MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP
/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring values igmp-querier and mld-querier).
```
```
This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
multicast-router (dis
abled | permanent |
temporary-query;
Default: temporary-
query)
```
A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and
IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge interface itself.
This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports and multicast traffic to the bridge interface for further
multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
disabled - disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD
membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.
permanent - enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD
membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.
temporary-query - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries.
```
querier-interval (time
; Default: 4m15s)
```
Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect when igmp-
snooping is set to yes.
```
query-interval (time;
Default: 2m5s)
```
Changes the interval on how often IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is acting as
an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes place when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an effect when igmp-
snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
query-response-
interval (time;
Default: 10s)
```
The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. This
property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
```
startup-query-count (
integer: 0..
4294967295 ;
Default:  2 )
```
```
Specifies how many times general IGMP/MLD queries must be sent when the bridge interface is enabled or active querier
timeouts. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and multicast-querier is set to yes.
```
```
startup-query-
interval (time;
Default: 31s250ms)
```
```
Specifies the interval between startup general IGMP/MLD queries. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping and m
ulticast-querier is set to yes.
```
Sub-menu: /interface bridge port
```
Property Description
```
```
fast-leave (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when
an IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
multicast-router (disa
bled | permanent |
temporary-query;
Default: temporary-
query)
```
```
A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams
and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This
property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports and multicast streams to certain bridge ports for further multicast
routing or proxying. This property only has an effect when igmp-snooping is set to yes.
```
```
disabled - disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership
reports are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.
permanent - enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports
are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.
temporary-query - automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries.
```
```
unknown-multicast-
flood (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Changes the multicast flood option on the bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding
multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the
specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic, this includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6, and the link-local multicast ranges
(e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1).
```
```
Note that when igmp-snooping is enabled and IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown
IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.
```
```
When using this setting together with igmp-snooping, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known
multicast from the MDB table.
```
Sub-menu: /interface bridge mdb
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (name;
Default: )
```
```
The bridge interface to which the MDB entry is going to be assigned.
```
```
disabled (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Disables or enables static MDB entry.
```
```
group (ipv4 | ipv6
address; Default:
)
```
```
The IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address. Static entries for link-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 and ff02::1 cannot be created, as
these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs.
```
```
ports (name;
Default: )
```
```
The list of bridge ports to which the multicast group will be forwarded.
```
```
vid (integer: 1..
4094 ; Default: )
```
```
The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created, only applies when vlan-filtering is enabled. When the VLAN ID is not
specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply on all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports.
```

Configuration examples
Below are described the most common configuration examples. Some examples are using a bridge with VLAN filtering, so make sure to understand the
filtering principles first - bridge VLAN filtering, bridge VLAN table.
Basic IGMP snooping configuration
The first example consists only of a single IGMP snooping bridge, a single multicast source device, and a couple of multicast client devices. See a network
scheme below.
First, create a bridge interface with enabled IGMP snooping. In this example, there is no active IGMP querier (no multicast router or proxy), so a local
IGMP querier must be enabled on the same bridge. This can be done with a multicast-querier setting. If there is no active IGMP querier in the LAN,
the unregistered IP multicast will be flooded and multicast entries will always timeout from the multicast database.
```
/interface bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yes name=bridge1
```
Then add the necessary interfaces as bridge ports.
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
```
The basic IGMP snooping configuration is finished. Use "/interface bridge mdb print" command to monitor the active multicast groups. If
necessary, you can configure an IP address and DHCP server on the same bridge interface.
IGMP snooping configuration with VLANs
The second example adds some complexity. There are two IGMP snooping bridges and we need to isolate the multicast traffic on a different VLAN. See a
network scheme below.
First, create a bridge on both devices and add the needed interfaces as bridge ports. To change untagged VLAN for a bridge port, use the pvid setting.
The Bridge1 will be acting as an IGMP querier. Below are the configuration commands for the Bridge1:
```
/interface bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yes name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=10
```
And for the Bridge2:
```
/interface bridge
add igmp-snooping=yes name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=10
```
Make sure to configure management access for devices. It is essential when configuring a bridge with VLAN filtering. In this example, a VLAN 99 interface
with an IP address is added to the bridge. This VLAN will be allowed on the tagged sfp-sfpplus1 port. Below are configuration commands for the Bridge1:
```
Bridge IGMP querier implementation can only send untagged IGMP queries. In case tagged IGMP queries should be sent or IGMP queries
should be generated in multiple VLANs, it is possible to install a multicast package, add a VLAN interface and configure a PIM interface on
VLAN. The PIM interface can be used as an IGMP querier.
```
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT network=192.168.99.0
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```
And for the Bridge2:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.2/24 interface=MGMT network=192.168.99.0
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```
Add bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged and untagged ports. The VLAN 99 entry was already created when configuring management access, only
VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 should be added now. Below are the configuration commands for the Bridge1:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=20
```
And for the Bridge2:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 untagged=ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=20
```
Last, enable VLAN filtering. Below is the configuration command for Bridge1 and Bridge2:
```
/interface bridge set [find name=bridge1] vlan-filtering=yes
```
At this point, VLANs and IGMP snooping are configured and devices should be able to communicate through ports. However, it is recommended to go
even a step further and apply some additional filtering options. Enable ingress-filtering and frame-types on bridge ports. Below are the
configuration commands for the Bridge1:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=ether2] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether3] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether4] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=ether5] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=sfp-sfpplus1] ingress-filtering=yes
```
And for the Bridge2:
```
/interface bridge port

Static MDB entries
Since RouterOS version 7.7, it is possible to create static MDB entries for IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups. For example, to create a static MDB entry for
multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:
```
/interface bridge mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=229.10.10.10 ports=ether2,ether3 vid=10
```
Verify the results with the print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge mdb print where group=229.10.10.10
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
# GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE
12 229.10.10.10 10 ether2 bridge1
ether3
```
In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a static
MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group ff02::2 on
all VLANs and ports (modify the ports setting for your particular setup):
```
/interface bridge mdb
add bridge=bridge1 group=ff02::2 ports=bridge1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge mdb print where group=ff02::2
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: GROUP, VID, ON-PORTS, BRIDGE
# GROUP VID ON-PORTS BRIDGE
0 ff02::2 bridge1
15 D ff02::2 1 bridge1 bridge1
16 D ff02::2 10 bridge1 bridge1

ether4
ether5
17 D ff02::2 20 bridge1 bridge1

## Summary
It is possible to use a bridge to filter out VLANs in your network. To achieve this, you should use the Bridge VLAN Filtering feature. This feature should be
used instead of many known VLAN misconfigurations that are most likely causing you either performance issues or connectivity issues, you can read
about one of the most popular misconfigurations in the VLAN in a bridge with a physical interface section. The most important part of the bridge VLAN
filtering feature is the bridge VLAN table, which specifies which VLANs are allowed on each port, but configuring it might get quite complex if you are trying
to make a more advanced setup, for generic setups you should be able to configure your device using the Trunk and Access ports example, but the
purpose of this guide is to provide in-depth explanation and point out some of the behavior characteristics when using bridge VLAN Filtering.

## Background
Before explaining bridge VLAN filtering in-depth, you should understand a few basic concepts that are involved in bridge VLAN filtering.
```
Tagged/Untagged - Under /interface bridge vlan menu, you can specify an entry that contains tagged and untagged ports. In general,
tagged ports should be your trunk ports and untagged ports should be your access ports. By specifying a tagged port the bridge will always set a
VLAN tag for packets that are being sent out through this port (egress). By specifying an untagged port the bridge will always remove the VLAN
tag from egress packets.
VLAN-ids - Under /interface bridge vlan menu, you can specify an entry in which certain VLANs are allowed on specific ports. The VLAN
ID is checked on egress ports. If the packet contains a VLAN ID that does not exist in the bridge VLAN table for the egress port, then the packet is
dropped before it gets sent out.
PVID - The Port VLAN ID is used for access ports to tag all ingress traffic with a specific VLAN ID. A dynamic entry is added in the bridge VLAN
table for every PVID used, the port is automatically added as an untagged port.
Ingress filtering - By default, VLANs that don't exist in the bridge VLAN table are dropped before they are sent out (egress), but this property
allows you to drop the packets when they are received (ingress).
Management access - The bridge is supposed to simply forward packets between bridge ports and it would seem to other devices that there is
simply a wire between them. With bridge VLAN filtering you can limit which packets are allowed to access the device that has the bridge
configured, the most common practice is to allow access to the device only by using a very specific VLAN ID, but there are other ways you can
grant access to the device. Management access is a great way to add another layer of security when accessing the device through a bridge port,
this type of access is sometimes called the management port. For devices that support VLAN Filtering with hardware offloading, It is also related
to the CPU port of a bridge.
CPU port - Every device with a switch chip has a special purpose port called CPU port and it is used to communicate with the device's CPU. For
devices that support VLAN filtering with hardware offloading, this port is the bridge interface itself. This port is mostly used to create management
access but can be used for other purposes, for example, to route traffic between VLANs, to mark packets, and to apply queues.
frame-type - You can filter out packets whether they have a VLAN tag or not, this is useful to add an extra layer of security for your bridge ports.
EtherType - By default, a VLAN aware bridge will filter VLANs by checking the C-TAG (0x8100), all other VLAN tags are considered as untagged
packets (without a VLAN tag). The selected EtherType will be used for VLAN filtering and VLAN tagging/untagging.
VLAN Tunnelling - If the EtherType of the packet does not match with the EtherType configured for the bridge, then ingress packets are
considered as untagged packets, this behavior gives a possibility to encapsulate VLANs into another, different VLAN. This also gives a possibility
to divert specific traffic through different devices in your network.
Tag stacking - If a packet has a VLAN tag that matches the EtherType, then the packet is considered as a tagged packet, but you can force
another VLAN tag regardless of the packet's content. By setting tag-stacking=yes on a bridge port, you will add another VLAN tag with the PV
ID value on top of any other tag for all ingress packets.
```

## Trunk/Access port setup
Below you can find a very common diagram for a very typical type of setup that consists of a trunk port and multiple access ports:
This setup is very common since it gives the possibility to divide your network into multiple segments while using a single switch and maybe a single
router, such a requirement is very common for companies that want to separate multiple departments. With VLANs you can use different DHCP Servers,
which can give out an IP address from a different subnet based on the VLAN ID, which makes creating Firewall rules and QoS a lot easier.
In such a setup you would connect some generic devices like Desktop PCs to ether2 and ether3, these can be considered as workstations and they
generally only use untagged traffic (it is possible to force a VLAN tag for all traffic that is sent out a generic workstation, though it is not very common). To
isolate some workstations from other workstations you must add a VLAN tag to all packets that enter ether2 or ether3, but to decide what VLAN ID should
the packet get, you need to use a concept called Port-based VLANs. In this concept, packets get a VLAN tag with a VLAN ID based on the bridge port to
which the device is connected. For example, in this setup the device on ether2 will get a VLAN tag with VLAN20 and the device on ether3 will get a VLAN
tag with VLAN30, this concept is very scalable as long as you have enough bridge ports. This should give you the understanding that traffic between the
bridge and devices behind ether2/ether3 is untagged (since there is no VLAN tag, hence the name).
When we have determined our untagged ports, we can now determine our tagged ports. Tagged ports are going to be the trunk ports (the port, that carries
multiple VLANs) and usually, this port is connected to a router or another switch/bridge, you can have multiple trunk ports as well. Tagged ports are always
carrying packets with a VLAN tag (hence the name) and you must ALWAYS specify the tagged ports for each VLAN ID you want this port to forward. It is
possible that a port is a tagged port for one VLAN ID and the same port is an untagged port for a different VLAN ID, but this is for a different type of setup
(Hybrid port setup).
A special note must be added for the PVID property. This property should be used on access ports, but it can be used for trunk ports as well (in Hybrid port
setup). By using the PVID property you are adding a new VLAN tag with a VLAN ID that is specified in the PVID to all UNTAGGED packets that are
received on that specific bridge port. The PVID does not have any effect on tagged packets, this means that, for example, if a packet with a VLAN tag of VL
AN40 is received on ether2 that has PVID=20, then the VLAN tag is NOT changed and forwarding will depend on the entries from the bridge VLAN table.
To configure the trunk/access port setup, you need to first create a bridge:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
```
Add the bridge ports and specify PVID for each access port:
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=30
```
```
Don't enable VLAN filtering yet as you might get locked out from the device because of the lack of management access, which is configured at
the end.
```
Add appropriate entries in the bridge VLAN table:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=30
```
You might think that you could simplify this entry with a single entry, similar to this:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=20,30
```
Do NOT use multiple VLAN IDs on access ports. This will unintentionally allow both VLAN20 and VLAN30 on both access ports. In the example above, eth
er3 is supposed to set a VLAN tag for all ingress packets to use VLAN30 (since PVID=30), but this does not limit the allowed VLANs on this port when
VLANs are being sent out through this port. The bridge VLAN table is responsible for deciding whether a VLAN is allowed to be sent through a specific port
or not. The entry above specifies that both VLAN20 and VLAN30 are allowed to be sent out through ether2 and ether3 and on top of that the entry
specifies that packets should be sent out without a VLAN tag (packets are sent out as untagged packets). As a result, you may create a packet leak from
VLANs to ports that are not even supposed to receive such traffic, see the image below.
```
A misconfigured VLAN table allows VLAN20 to be sent through ether3, it will also allow VLAN30 through ether2
```
It is not necessary to add a bridge port as an untagged port, because each bridge port is added as an untagged port dynamically with a VLAN ID that is
specified in the PVID property. This is because of a feature that automatically will add an appropriate entry in the bridge VLAN table for convenience and
performance reasons, this feature does have some caveats that you must be aware of. All ports that have the same PVID will be added to a single entry for
the appropriate VLAN ID as untagged ports, but note that the Bridge interface also has a VLAN ID.
For testing purposes, we are going to enable VLAN filtering, but note that it might make you lose access to the device since it does not have management
access configured yet (we will configure it later). It is always recommended to configure VLAN filtering while using a serial console, though you can also
configure a device through a port, that is not added to a bridge. Make sure you are using a serial console or connected through a different port (that is not
in a bridge) and enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
```
PVID has no effect until VLAN filtering is enabled.
```
```
Don't use more than one VLAN ID specified in a bridge VLAN table entry for access ports, you should only specify multiple VLAN IDs for trunk
ports.
```
If you have enabled VLAN filtering now and printed out the current VLAN table, you would see such a table:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge vlan print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# BRIDGE VLAN-IDS CURRENT-TAGGED CURRENT-UNTAGGED
0 bridge1 20 ether1 ether2
1 bridge1 30 ether1 ether3
2 D bridge1 1 bridge1
ether1
```
There is a dynamic entry added for VLAN1 since PVID=1 is set by default to all bridge ports (including our trunk port, ether1), but you should also notice
that the bridge1 interface (the CPU port) is also added dynamically. You should be aware that bridge1 is also a bridge port and therefore might get added
to the bridge VLAN table dynamically. There is a chance that you might unintentionally allow access to the device because of this feature. For example, if
you have followed this guide and left PVID=1 set for the trunk port (ether1) and did not change the PVID for the CPU port (bridge1) as well, then access
through ether1 to the device using untagged traffic is allowed, this is also visible when you print out the bridge VLAN table. This scenario is illustrated in
the image below:
```
Unintentionally allowed management access using untagged traffic through the trunk port
```
There is a simple way to prevent the bridge (CPU port) from being added as an untagged port, you can simply set the PVID on the trunk port to be different
than the bridge's PVID (or change the bridge's PVID), but there is another option, which is more intuitive and recommended. Since you are expecting that
the trunk port is only supposed to receive tagged traffic (in this example, it should only receive VLAN20/VLAN30), but no untagged traffic, then you can use
ingress-filtering along with frame-type to filter out unwanted packets, but to fully understand the behavior of ingress filtering, we must first understand the
details of management access.
Management access is used to create a way to access a device through a bridge that has VLAN filtering enabled. You could simply allow untagged access
and doing that is fairly simple. Let us say you wanted the workstation behind ether3 to be able to access the device, we assumed before that the
workstation is a generic computer that will not use tagged packets and therefore will only send out untagged packets, this means that we should add the
CPU port (bridge1) as an untagged interface to the bridge VLAN table, to do so, simply use the same PVID value for the bridge1 and ether3 ports and set
both ports as untagged members for the VLAN ID. In this case, you are going to connect from ether3 that has PVID=30, so you change the configuration
accordingly:
```
You might not lose access to the device as soon as you enable VLAN filtering, but you might get disconnected since the bridge must reset itself
in order for VLAN filtering to take any effect, which will force you to reconnect (this is mostly relevant when using MAC-telnet). There is a chance
you might be able to access your device using untagged traffic, this scenario is described below.
```
```
Always check the bridge VLAN table if you have not unintentionally allowed certain VLANs or untagged traffic to specific ports, especially the
CPU port (bridge).
```
```
/interface bridge set [find name=bridge1] pvid=30
/interface bridge vlan set [find vlan-ids=30] untagged=bridge1,ether3
```
Allowing access to the device using untagged traffic is not considered a good security practice, a much better way is to allow access to the device using a
very specific VLAN sometimes called the management VLAN, in our case, this is going to be VLAN99. This adds a significant layer of security since an
attacker must guess the VLAN ID that is being used for management purposes and then guess the login credentials, on top of this you can even add
another layer of security by allowing access to the device using only certain IP addresses. The purpose of this guide is to provide an in-depth explanation,
for that reason, we are adding a level of complexity to our setup to understand some possible caveats that you must take into account. We are going to
allow access from an access port using tagged traffic (illustrated in the image below). To allow access to the device using VLAN99 from ether3, we must
add a proper entry in the bridge VLAN table. Additionally, a network device connected to ether3 must support VLAN tagging.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
```
Management access using tagged traffic through an access port (which makes it a hybrid port)
```
But you might notice that access using VLAN99 does not work at this point, this is because you need a VLAN interface that listens for tagged traffic, you
can simply create this interface for the appropriate VLAN ID and you can set an IP address for the interface as well:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN99 vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.2/24 interface=VLAN99
```
```
You can use the feature that dynamically adds untagged ports with the same PVID value, you can simply change the PVID to match between et
her3 and bridge1.
```
```
If PVID for ether1 and bridge1 matches (by default, it does match with 1), then access to the device is allowed using untagged traffic
from ether1 because of the feature that dynamically adds untagged ports to the bridge VLAN table.
```
```
Our access port (ether3) at this point expects tagged and untagged traffic at the same time, such a port is called a hybrid port.
```
At this point, we can benefit from using ingress-filtering and frame-type. First, we are going to focus on frame-type, which limits the allowed
packet types (tagged, untagged, both), but for frame-type to work properly, ingress-filtering must be enabled, otherwise it will not have any
effect. In our example, where we wanted to allow access from ether3 using tagged traffic (VLAN99) and at the same time allow a generic workstation to
access the network, we can conclude that this port needs to allow tagged and untagged packets, but ether1 and ether2 are supposed to receive only
specific types of packets, for this reasons we can enhance our network's security. Since ether1 is our trunk port, it is only supposed to carry tagged
packets, but ether2 is our access port so it should not carry any tagged packets, based on these conclusions we can drop invalid packets:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether1] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
set [find where interface=ether2] ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```
Let's say that you forgot to enable ingress-filtering and change the frame-type property on ether1, this would unintentionally add access to the device
through ether1 using untagged traffic since PVID matches for bridge1 and ether1, but you are expecting only tagged traffic to be able to access the device.
It is possible to drop all untagged packets that are destined for the CPU port:
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged ingress-filtering=yes
```
This does not only drop untagged packets, but disables the feature that dynamically adds untagged ports to the bridge VLAN table. If you print out the
current bridge VLAN table you will notice that bridge1 is not dynamically added as an untagged port:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge vlan print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# BRIDGE VLAN-IDS CURRENT-TAGGED CURRENT-UNTAGGED
0 bridge1 20 ether1
1 bridge1 30 ether1 ether3
2 D bridge1 1 ether1
3 bridge1 99 bridge1
ether3
```
While frame-type can be used to drop a certain type of packet, the ingress-filtering can be used to filter out packets before they can be sent out.
To fully understand the need for ingress filtering, consider the following scenario: VLAN99 is allowed on ether3 and bridge1, but you can still send VLAN99
traffic from ether1 to ether3, this is because the bridge VLAN table checks if a port is allowed to carry a certain VLAN only on egress ports. In our case, eth
er3 is allowed to carry VLAN99 and for this reason, it is forwarded. To prevent this you MUST use ingress-filtering. With ingress filtering, ingress packets
are also checked, in our case, the bridge VLAN table does not contain an entry that VLAN99 is allowed on ether1 and therefore will be dropped
immediately. Of course, in our scenario without ingress filtering connection cannot be established since VLAN99 can be forwarded only from ether1 to ether3
, but not from ether3 to ether1, though there are still possible attacks that can be used in such a misconfiguration (for example, ARP poisoning). The
packet dropping behavior is illustrated in the image below:
```
When frame-type=admit-only-vlan-tagged is used on a port, then the port is not dynamically added as an untagged port for the PVID.
```
```
Trunk/access port setup with and without ingress filtering. Ingress filtering can prevent unwanted traffic from being forwarded. Note that ether1 is not
allowed to carry VLAN99 in the bridge VLAN table.
```
The ingress-filtering can be used on the CPU port (bridge) as well, this can be used to prevent some possible attack vectors and limit the allowed VLANs
that can access the CPU. It is better to drop a packet on an ingress port, rather than on an egress port, this reduces the CPU load, which is quite crucial
when you are using hardware offloading with bridge VLAN filtering.
```
Always try to use ingress-filtering wherever it is possible, it adds a significant layer of security.
```
```
The ingress-filtering property only affects ingress traffic, but frame-type affects both egress and ingress traffic.
```
Even though you can limit the allowed VLANs and packet types on a port, it is never a good security practice to allow access to a device through access
ports since an attacker could sniff packets and extract the management VLAN's ID, you should only allow access to the device from the trunk port (ether1)
since trunk ports usually have better physical security, you should remove the previous entry and allow access to the device through the port that is
connected to your router (illustrated in the image below):
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether1 vlan-ids=99
```
VLAN Tunnelling setup
In some cases, you might want to forward already tagged traffic through certain switches. This is a quite common setup for backbone infrastructures since
it provides a possibility to encapsulate traffic from, for example, your edge routers and seamlessly forward it over your backbone to another edge router.
Below you can find an example of a VLAN tunneling topology:
```
Provider bridge topology
```
SVID stands for Service VID, indicating the tag type along with the VID.
There are two possible ways to achieve this, one is the standardized IEEE 802.1ad way, and the other way is using Tag stacking, we will first review the
standardized way since the same principles apply to both ways and only a couple of parameters must be changed to use the other method. The way VLAN
tunneling works is that the bridge checks if the outer VLAN tag is using the same VLAN tag as specified as ether-type. If the VLAN tag matches, the packet
is considered as a tagged packet, otherwise, it is considered as an untagged packet.
The ether-type property allows you to select the following EtherTypes for the VLAN tag:
```
0x88a8 - IEEE 802.1ad, Service Tag
0x8100 - IEEE 802.1Q, Customer VLAN (regular VLAN tag)
0x9100 - Unofficial tag type (rarely used)
```
To properly configure bridge VLAN filtering, you must understand how the bridge distinguishes between tagged and untagged packets. As mentioned
before, the bridge will check if EtherType matches with the outer VLAN tag in the packet. For example, consider the following packet:

### FFFFFFFFFFFF 6C3B6B7C413E 8100 6063 9999

### ----------------------------------------

### DST-MAC = FFFFFFFFFFFF

### SRC-MAC = 6C3B6B7C413E
```
Outer EtherType = 8100 (IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag)
VLAN priority = 6
VLAN ID = 99 (HEX = 63)
Inner EtherType = 9999
```
Let us assume that we have set ether-type=0x88a8, in this case, the packet above will be considered untagged since the bridge is looking for a
different VLAN tag. Lets now consider the following packet:

### FFFFFFFFFFFF 6C3B6B7C413E 88A8 6063 8100 5062 9999

### ----------------------------------------

### DST-MAC = FFFFFFFFFFFF

### SRC-MAC = 6C3B6B7C413E
```
Outer EtherType = 88A8 (IEEE 802.1ad VLAN tag)
VLAN priority = 6
VLAN ID = 99 (HEX = 63)
Inner EtherType 1 = 8100 (IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag)
VLAN priority = 5
VLAN ID = 98 (HEX = 62)
Innter EtherType 2 = 9999
```
This time let us assume that we have set ether-type=0x8100, in this case, the packet above is considered as untagged as well since the outer tag is
using an IEEE 802.1ad VLAN tag. The same principles apply to other VLAN related functions, for example, the PVID property will add a new VLAN tag on
access ports and the VLAN tag will be using the EtherType specified in ether-type.
Both SW1 and SW2 are using the same configuration:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes ether-type=0x88a8
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```
```
To fully understand how to configure VLAN tunneling properly, you should first read the Trunk/Access port setup section before proceeding any
further.
```
```
The bridge checks only the outer tag (closest to the MAC address), any other tag is ignored anywhere in a bridge configuration. The bridge is
not aware of the packet contents, even though there might be another VLAN tag, only the first VLAN tag is checked.
```
In this example, we are assuming that all routers are passing traffic that is using a regular/customer VLAN tag. Such traffic on switches will be considered
as untagged traffic based on the principle described above. Switches will encapsulate this traffic using a Service VLAN tag (the outer 802.1ad tag) and
traffic between SW1 and SW2 will be considered as tagged. Before traffic reaches its destination, the switches will decapsulate the outer tag and forward
the original 802.1Q tagged frame. See a packet example below:
```
A packet example before and after 802.1ad VLAN encapsulation
```
In case you want to create management access from, let's say, ether3 to the device and want to use VLAN99, then you would use such commands:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3 vlan-ids=99
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN99 use-service-tag=yes vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.2/24 interface=VLAN99
```
As you may notice, the only difference is that the VLAN interface is using use-service-tag=yes, this sets the VLAN interface to listen to IEEE 802.1ad
VLAN tags. This will require you to use the IEEE 802.1ad VLAN tag to access the device using the management VLAN - you will not be able to connect to
the device using a regular VLAN tag while bridge VLAN filtering is enabled. The ether-type is set globally and will affect all bridge VLAN filtering functions.
Tag Stacking
In the VLAN Tunnelling setup, we were adding a new VLAN tag that was different from the VLAN tag, but it is possible to add a new VLAN tag regardless
of the packet contents. The difference between the regular VLAN tunneling setup is that the bridge does not check if the packet is tagged or untagged, it
assumes that all packets that are received on a specific port are all untagged packets and will add a new VLAN tag regardless of whether a VLAN tag is
present or not, this is called Tag Stacking since it "stacks" VLAN tags on top of the previous tag, regardless of the VLAN tag type. This is a very common
setup for networks that do not support the IEEE 802.1ad standard, but still want to encapsulate VLAN traffic into a new VLAN.
The VLAN tag that is going to be added depends on ether-type and PVID. For example, if you have ether-type=0x8100 and PVID=200 on a port,
then the bridge will add a new IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag right on top of any other tag (if such are present). The same VLAN filtering principles still apply, you
have to determine which ports are going to be your trunk ports and mark them as tagged ports, determine your access ports, and add them as untagged
ports.
To explain how VLAN tagging and untagging works with tag stacking, let us use the same network topology as before:
```
All principles that apply to the regular trunk/access port setup using IEEE 802.1Q also apply to VLAN tunneling setups, make sure you are
limiting VLANs and packet type properly using the bridge VLAN table and ingress filtering.
```
```
Devices with switch chip Marvell-98DX3257 (e.g. CRS354 series) do not support VLAN filtering on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for other VLAN
types (0x88a8 and 0x9100).
```
What we want to achieve is that regardless of what is being received on ether2 and ether3, a new VLAN tag will be added to encapsulate the traffic that is
coming from those ports. Tag-stacking forces a new VLAN tag, so we can use this property to achieve our desired setup. We are going to be using the
same configuration as in the Trunk/Access port setup, but with tag-stacking enabled on the access ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes ether-type=0x8100
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 tag-stacking=yes pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 tag-stacking=yes pvid=30
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=30
```
Let us assume that the devices behind ether2 and ether3 are sending tagged VLAN40 traffic. With this configuration, ALL packets will get encapsulated
with a new VLAN tag, but you must make sure that you have added the VLAN ID from the outer tag to the bridge VLAN table. The VLAN40 is not added to
the bridge VLAN table since it is the inner tag and it is not checked, we are only concerned about the outer tag, which is either VLAN20 or VLAN30 dependi
ng on the port.
Similar to other setups, the bridge VLAN table is going to be used to determine if the VLAN tag needs to be removed or not. For example, ether1 receives
tagged VLAN20 packets, the bridge checks that ether2 is allowed to carry VLAN20 so it is about to send it out through ether2, but it also checks the bridge
VLAN table whether the VLAN tag should be removed and since ether2 is marked as an untagged port, then the bridge will forward these packets from ethe
r1 to ether2 without the VLAN20 VLAN tag.
From the access port perspective, the same principles as in the Trunk/Access port setup apply. All packets that are received on ether2 will get a new VLAN
tag with the VLAN ID that is specified in PVID, in this case, a new VLAN tag will be added with VLAN20 and this VLAN will be subjected to VLAN filtering.
See a packet example below:
```
The added VLAN tag will use the specified ether-type. The selected EtherType will also be used for VLAN filtering. Only the outer tag is
checked, but with tag-stacking in place, the tag checking is skipped and assumes that a new tag must be added either way.
```

## Summary
```
Controller Bridge (CB) and Port Extender (PE) is an IEEE 802.1BR standard implementation in RouterOS for CRS3xx series switches. It allows
virtually extending the CB ports with a PE device and manage these extended interfaces from a single controlling device. Such configuration provides
a simplified network topology, flexibility, increased port density and ease of manageability. An example of Controller Bridge and Port Extender
topology can be seen below.
```
The Controller Bridge establishes communication with the Port Extender through a cascade port. Similarly, the Port Extender will communicate with
the Controller Bridge only through an upstream port. On a PE device, control ports must be configured and only one port (closest to the CB) will act as
an upstream port, other control ports can act as a backup for upstream port or even cascade port for switches connected in series (e.g. Port Extender
2 and 3 in the image above). Cascade and upstream ports are used to transmit and receive control and network traffic. Extended ports are interfaces
that are controlled by the CB device and they are typically connected to the end hosts. Extended ports only transmit and receive network traffic.

## Quick setup
In this example, we will create a Controlling Bridge (e.g. a CRS317-1G-16S+ switch) that will connect to a single Port Extender (e.g. a CRS326-24G-
2S+ switch) through an SFP+1 interface.
First, configure a bridge with enabled VLAN filtering on a CB device:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
On the same device, configure a port that is connected to the PE device and will act as cascade port:
```
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1
```
Last, on a PE device, simply configure a control port, which will be selected as an upstream port:
```
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1
```
Once PE and CB devices are connected, all interfaces that are on the same switch group (except for control ports) will be extended and can be further
configured on a CB device. An automatic bridge port configuration will be applied on the CB device which adds all extended ports in a single bridge,
this configuration can be modified afterward.

## Discovery and control protocols
Before frame forwarding on extended ports is possible, Controlling Bridge and Port Extender must discover each other and exchange with essential
information.
CB and PE enabled devices are using a neighbor discovery protocol LLDP with specific Port Extension TLV. This allows CB and PE devices to
advertise their support on cascade and control ports.
Once LLDP messages are exchanged between CB and PE, a Control and Status Protocol (CSP) over an Edge Control Protocol (ECP) will initiate.
The CSP is used between CB and PE to assert control and receive status information from the associated PE - it assigns unique IDs for extended
ports, controls data-path settings (e.g. port VLAN membership) and sends port status information (e.g. interface stats, PoE-out monitoring). The ECP
provides a reliable and sequenced frame delivery (encoded with EtherType 0x8940).


# Packet flow
```
In order to exclude some port from being extended (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes), additionally, configure excluded-ports
property.
```
```
Make sure not to include the cascade-ports and control-ports in any routing or bridging configurations. These ports are
recommended only for a CB and PE usage.
```
```
CB and PE configuration can override the neighbor discovery settings, for example, if a cascade port is not included in a neighbor discovery
interface list, the LLDP messages will be still sent.
```
```
The current CB implementation does not support any failover techniques. Once the CB device becomes unavailable, the PE devices will
lose all the control and data forwarding rules.

To better understand the underlying principles of Controlling Bridge and Port Extender, a packet walkthrough is provided below:
```
An L2 packet is received on the extended port;
The Port Extender encapsulates the packet with an E-TAG header (EtherType 0x893F) and forwards it through an upstream port, towards
the Controller Bridge. An E-TAG packet contains information regarding the PE source port ID. The PE device does not make any local
switching decisions;
The Controller Bridge receives the E-TAG packet and knows exactly which extended interface received it. The CB then internally
decapsulates the packet and proceed it through a regular switching decision (host learning, destination address lookup, VLAN filtering, etc.);
Once a switching decision is made, the CB will again encapsulate the original packet with an E-TAG and send it through a cascade port,
towards Port Extender;
For a single destination packet (unicast), the CB will include the PE destination port ID in the E-TAG and send it through a correct
cascade port;
For a multi-destination packet (broadcast, multicast or unknown-unicast), the CB will include a target group mark and source port ID
in the E-TAG and send a single packet replica per every cascade port;
Once a PE device receives an E-TAG packet on the upstream port, PE decapsulates it and sends the original L2 packet through the
extended port;
For a single destination packet (unicast), the PE will send the packet only to the correct extended port;
For a multi-destination packet (broadcast, multicast or unknown-unicast), the PE will send a single packet replica per every
extended port (except for the source port where the packet was received).
```

Configuration examples
Below are described the most common configuration examples. For CB and PE configuration to work properly, a bridge VLAN filtering needs to be
enabled, so make sure to understand the filtering principles first - bridge VLAN filtering, bridge VLAN table.
Basic CB and PE configuration
In this example, a CRS317-1G-16S+ device is used as a Controller Bridge and CRS328-24P-4S+ as a Port Extender, see the connection scheme
below.
First, configure the CB device. This can be done by adding a bridge interface with enabled VLAN filtering. Additionally, add any local interfaces to the
same bridge, it allows to forward traffic between any local interfaces and extended interfaces. In this example, an sfp-sfpplus2 interface is added.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus2
```
To enable CB, specify the bridge, switch and at least one cascade port. Make sure that cascade ports are not included in the bridge or routing
configurations. These ports are recommended only for a CB and PE usage.
```
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1
```
To enable PE, configure control ports and switch. Additionally, configure one or multiple interfaces that should not be extended with excluded-ports
property (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes). In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
```
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus4 switch=switch1
```
Once PE and CB devices finish the discovery and start the Control and Status Protocol (CSP), the RouterOS will permanently create new interfaces
and add them into bridge on the CB device. Interfaces are named by the automatically assigned PE device name, plus the default interface name,
these interface names can be modified afterwards. Note that control and excluded ports will be also displayed into the interface list, but they are not
included into the bridge.

```
Now the CRS317-1G-16S+ device has extended its ports using the CRS328-24P-4S+ device and packet forwarding can be done between all bridged
ports.
Trunk and Access ports
In this example, untagged (access) and tagged (trunk) port configuration will be created on the Controller Bridge device, see the network diagram
below.
First, configure the CB and PE devices, the configuration is identical to the previous example. Use this configuration for CB device.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=sfp-sfpplus1 switch=switch1
```
Use this configuration for PE device.
```
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=sfp-sfpplus4 switch=switch1
```
After extended ports are successfully created and added to the bridge on the CB device, we can start configuring VLAN related properties. First,
configure access ports to their respective VLAN ID using a pvid property. Use a print command in "/interface bridge port" menu to find out
the exact interface name.
```
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=pe1-ether1] pvid=10
set [find interface=pe1-ether2] pvid=20
set [find interface=pe1-ether3] pvid=30
```
Then add bridge VLAN entries and specify tagged, untagged ports. Note that there are two tagged ports - local port named sfp-sfpplus2 and extended
port named pe1-sfpplus1.
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=pe1-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2 untagged=pe1-ether3 vlan-ids=30
```
At this point VLANs are configured and devices should be able to communicate through the ports. However, it is recommended to go even a step
further and apply some additional filtering options. Enable port ingress-filtering on local bridge ports and use frame filtering based on the
packet type with frame-types setting.
```
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=pe1-ether1] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-ether2] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-ether3] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
set [find interface=pe1-sfpplus1] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
set [find interface=sfp-sfpplus2] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged ingress-filtering=yes
```
Cascading multiple Port Extenders and using bonding interface
In this example, two PE devices (CRS328-24P-4S+ and CRS326-24G-2S+) will be added to the CB (CRS317-1G-16S+). To increase throughput for
upstream and cascade ports, bonding interfaces will be created. See the network diagram below.
```
Port ingress VLAN filtering is not supported on extended ports.
```
The CB and PE configuration is similar to the first example, the main difference is the bonding interface usage. First, configure the CB device - create
a bonding interface for cascade port, create a bridge and add any needed local bridge ports, last enable the CB. Use the following commands:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus3
/interface bridge port-controller
set bridge=bridge1 cascade-ports=bond1 switch=switch1
```
Then configure the Port Extender 1 device. This device needs two bonding interfaces - the first one will be used as an upstream port and the second
one will be a cascade port for the Port Extender 2 device. Additionally, configure one or multiple interfaces that should not be extended with excluded
-ports property (e.g. for out-of-band management purposes). In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
add mode=802.3ad name=bond2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=bond1,bond2 switch=switch1
```
Last, configure the Port Extender 2 device - create a bonding interface and enable PE. Additionally, configure one or multiple excluded-ports if
necessary. In this example, all switch ports will be extended.
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
/interface bridge port-extender
set control-ports=bond1 switch=switch1
```
Now the CRS317-1G-16S+ device has extended its ports with additional 48 Gigabit Ethernet ports and packet forwarding can be achieved between all
bridged ports.
Use the monitor command in the device menu to see the PE device connection path. Also, use print command in the port menu to see which PE
interfaces are used as upstream and cascade ports.

Configuration modification and removal
In certain situations, CB and PE device configuration needs to be adjusted (e.g. PE device needs new control ports) or removed completely. To modify
the PE device configuration, all related PE device configuration should be removed from the CB device first. Only then the new configuration can be
applied.
First, to remove PE configuration from CB, disable the PE using the following command:
```
/interface bridge port-extender set switch=none control-ports="" excluded-ports=""
```
Then, on the CB device, remove the related bridge and other RouterOS configuration where PE interfaces were used (e.g. see the export from "/inte
rface bridge port" and "/interface bridge vlan" menus). For example, to remove all bridge ports from a specific PE device, use the
command below:
```
/interface bridge port remove [find interface~"pe1"]
```
Once the configuration is removed, PE can be removed from the CB device list. This command will also automatically remove all the PE device
interfaces from the CB interface list. In case some PE interface configuration is still applied on the CB, it will not be valid anymore. Use print
command to find out the PE device name.
```
/interface bridge port-controller device remove [find name=pe1]
```

## Summary
Basic use cases and configuration examples for Cloud Router Switch features.

## Port switching
To set up port switching on CRS1xx/2xx series switches, check the Bridge Hardware Offloading page.

## Management access configuration
In general, switches are only supposed to forward packets by using the built-in switch chip, but not allow access to the device itself for security reasons. It
is possible to use the device's serial port for management access, but in most cases, such an access method is not desired and access using an IP
address is more suitable. In such cases, you will need to configure management access.
```
This article applies to CRS1xx and CRS2xx series switches and not to CRS3xx series switches. For CRS3xx series devices read the CRS3xx,
CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 manual.
```
```
It is possible to create multiple isolated switch groups by using multiple bridges with enabled hardware offloading, this is possible only on
CRS1xx/2xx series switches. For more complex setups (for example, VLAN filtering) you should use the port isolation feature instead.
```
In all types of management access it is assumed that ports must be switched together, use the following commands to switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
You should also assign an IP address to the bridge interface so the device is reachable using an IP address (the device is also reachable using a MAC
address):
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
Untagged
If invalid VLAN filtering is not enabled, management access to the device using tagged or untagged (VLAN 0) traffic is already allowed from any port,
though this is not a good practice, this can cause security issues and can cause the device's CPU to be overloaded in certain situations (most commonly
with a broadcast type of traffic).
If you intend to use invalid VLAN filtering (which you should), then ports, from which you are going to access the switch, must be added to the VLAN table
for untagged (VLAN 0) traffic, for example, in case you want to access the switch from ether2:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add vlan-id=0 ports=ether2,switch1-cpu
```
Tagged
Allowing only tagged traffic to have management access to the device through a specific port is a much better practice. For example, to allow only VLAN99
to access the device through ether2 you should first add an entry to the VLAN table, which will allow the selected port and the CPU port (switch1-cpu) to
forward the selected VLAN ID, therefore allowing management access:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,switch1-cpu vlan-id=99
```
Packets that will be sent out from the CPU, for example, ping replies will not have a VLAN tag, to solve this you need to specify which ports should always
send out packets with a VLAN tag for a specific VLAN ID:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2,switch1-cpu vlan-id=99
```
After a valid VLAN99 configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering, which will not allow the management access through
different ports than specified in the VLAN table:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5
```
In this example VLAN99 will be used to access the device, a VLAN interface on the bridge must be created and an IP address must be assigned to it.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
VLAN
Port Based VLAN
Example 1 (Trunk and Access ports)
Switch together the required ports:
```
It is recommended to get a Serial Console cable and testing it before configuring VLANs because you may lose access to the CPU and/or the
port you are connected to.
```
```
Some changes may take some time to take effect due to already-learned MAC addresses. In such cases flushing the Unicast Forwarding
Database can help: /interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb flush
```
```
Multiple hardware offloaded bridge configuration is designed as a fast and simple port isolation solution, but it limits part of the VLAN
functionality supported by the CRS switch-chip. For advanced configurations use one bridge within the CRS switch chip for all ports, configure
VLANs, and isolate port groups with port isolation profile configuration.
```
```
For CRS3xx series devices, you must use bridge VLAN filtering, you can read more about it in the Bridge VLAN Filtering section.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Specify the VLAN ID that the switch must set on untagged (VLAN0) traffic for each access port:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400
```
You must also specify which VLANs should be sent out to the trunk port with a VLAN tag. Use the tagged-ports property to set up a trunk port:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=400
```
Add entries to the VLAN table to specify VLAN memberships for each port and each VLAN ID:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether6 vlan-id=200
add ports=ether2,ether7 vlan-id=300
add ports=ether2,ether8 vlan-id=400
```
After a valid VLAN configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8
```
Example 2 (Trunk and Hybrid Ports)
```
When an entry is created under /interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation, then the switch chip will add a VLAN tag
on ingress frames on the specified port. To remove the VLAN tag on the same port for egress frames, an /interface ethernet switch
egress-vlan-tag entry should be created for the same VLAN ID where only tagged ports are specified. If a specific VLAN is forwarded only
between access ports, the /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag entry should still be created without any tagged ports.
Another option is to create extra entries under /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-translation menu to set untagged
(VLAN0) traffic.
```
```
It is possible to use the built-in switch chip and the CPU at the same time to create a Switch-Router setup, where a device acts as a switch and
as a router simultaneously. You can find a configuration example in the CRS-Router guide.
```
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Specify the VLAN ID that the switch must set on untagged (VLAN0) traffic for each access port:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400
```
By specifying ports as tagged-ports, the switch will always send out packets as tagged packets with the corresponding VLAN ID. Add appropriate entries
according to the diagram above:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether6,ether8 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7 vlan-id=400
```
Add entries to the VLAN table to specify VLAN memberships for each port and each VLAN ID:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=200 learn=yes
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=300 learn=yes
add ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8 vlan-id=400 learn=yes
```
After a valid VLAN configuration has been set up, you can enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8
```
Protocol Based VLAN
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Set VLAN for IP and ARP protocols:
```
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=arp set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether6 protocol=arp set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=200
add port=ether2 protocol=ip set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether6 protocol=ip set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=200
```
Set VLAN for IPX protocol:
```
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=ipx set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether7 protocol=ipx set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=300
```
Set VLAN for AppleTalk AARP and AppleTalk DDP protocols:
```
/interface ethernet switch protocol-based-vlan
add port=ether2 protocol=0x80F3 set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether8 protocol=0x80F3 set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=400
add port=ether2 protocol=0x809B set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=0
add port=ether8 protocol=0x809B set-customer-vid-for=all new-customer-vid=400
```
MAC Based VLAN
Switch together the required ports:
```
Internally all MAC addresses in MAC-based VLANs are hashed, certain MAC addresses can have the same hash, which will prevent a MAC
address from being loaded into the switch chip if the hash matches with a hash from a MAC address that has been already loaded, for this
reason, it is recommended to use Port bases VLANs in combination with MAC-based VLANs. This is a hardware limitation.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
```
Enable MAC-based VLAN translation on access port:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 allow-fdb-based-vlan-translate=yes
```
Add MAC-to-VLAN mapping entries in the MAC-based VLAN table:
```
/interface ethernet switch mac-based-vlan
add src-mac=A4:12:6D:77:94:43 new-customer-vid=200
add src-mac=84:37:62:DF:04:20 new-customer-vid=300
add src-mac=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 new-customer-vid=400
```
Add VLAN200, VLAN300, and VLAN400 tagging on the ether2 port to create it as a VLAN trunk port:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=400
```
Additionally, add entries to the VLAN table, specify VLAN membership for each port, and enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering, see an example below - U
nknown/Invalid VLAN filtering. This is required for network setups where more interfaces are added to the bridge, as it allows to define VLAN boundaries.
InterVLAN Routing
InterVLAN routing configuration consists of two main parts – VLAN tagging in switch-chip and routing in RouterOS. This configuration can be used in many
applications by combining it with a DHCP server, Hotspot, PPP, and other features for each VLAN.
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Set VLAN tagging on the CPU port for all VLANs to make packets tagged before they are routed:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=200
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=300
add tagged-ports=switch1-cpu vlan-id=400
```
add ingress VLAN translation rules to ensure that the correct VLAN ID assignment is done on access ports:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add ports=ether6 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=200
add ports=ether7 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=300
add ports=ether8 customer-vid=0 new-customer-vid=400
```
Create the VLAN interfaces on top of the bridge interface:
```
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN200 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=200
add name=VLAN300 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=300
add name=VLAN400 interface=bridge1 vlan-id=400
```
Add IP addresses on created VLAN interfaces. In this example, three 192.168.x.1 addresses are added to VLAN200, VLAN300, and VLAN400 interfaces:
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN200
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=VLAN300
add address=192.168.40.1/24 interface=VLAN400
```
Unknown/Invalid VLAN filtering
VLAN membership is defined in the VLAN table. Adding entries with VLAN ID and ports makes that VLAN traffic valid on those ports. After a valid VLAN
configuration has been set up, unknown/invalid VLAN filtering can be enabled. This VLAN filtering configuration example applies to the InterVLAN Routing s
etup.
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether6 vlan-id=200
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether7 vlan-id=300
add ports=switch1-cpu,ether8 vlan-id=400
```
```
Option 1: disable invalid VLAN forwarding on specific ports (more common):
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether2,ether6,ether7,ether8
```
```
Option 2: disable invalid VLAN forwarding on all ports:
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set forward-unknown-vlan=no
```
VLAN Tunneling (Q-in-Q)
This example covers a typical VLAN tunneling use case where service provider devices add another VLAN tag for independent forwarding in the meantime
allowing customers to use their own VLANs.
```
Make sure the VLAN interfaces are created on top of the bridge interface instead of any of the physical interfaces. If the VLAN interfaces are
created on a slave interface, then the packet might not be received correctly, and therefore routing might fail. More detailed information can be
found in the VLAN interface on a slave interface manual page.
```
```
Using multiple bridges on a single switch chip with enabled unknown/invalid VLAN filtering can cause unexpected behavior. You should always
use a single bridge configuration whenever using VLAN filtering. If port isolation is required, then the port isolation feature should be used
instead of using multiple bridges.
```
```
This example contains only the Service VLAN tagging part. It is recommended to additionally set Unknown/Invalid VLAN filtering configuration
on ports.
```
CRS-1: The first switch on the edge of the service provider network has to properly identify traffic from the customer VLAN ID on port and assign a new
service VLAN ID with ingress VLAN translation rules. VLAN trunk port configuration for service provider VLAN tags is in the same egress-vlan-tag tabl
e. The main difference from basic Port-Based VLAN configuration is that the CRS switch-chip has to be set to do forwarding according to service (outer)
VLAN ID instead of customer (inner) VLAN ID.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=200 new-service-vid=400 ports=ether1
add customer-vid=300 new-service-vid=500 ports=ether2
```
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether9 vlan-id=400
add tagged-ports=ether9 vlan-id=500
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid
```
CRS-2: The second switch in the service provider network requires only switched ports to do forwarding according to service (outer) VLAN ID instead of
customer (inner) VLAN ID.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid
```
CRS-3: The third switch has a similar configuration to CRS-1:
```
Ports in a switch group using a bridge;
Ingress VLAN translation rules to define new service VLAN assignments on ports;
tagged-ports for service provider VLAN trunks;
CRS switch-chip set to use service VLAN ID in switching lookup.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=200 new-service-vid=400 ports=ether3
add customer-vid=300 new-service-vid=500 ports=ether4
```
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether10 vlan-id=400
add tagged-ports=ether10 vlan-id=500
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid
```
CVID Stacking
It is possible to use CRS1xx/CRS2xx series switches for CVID Stacking setups. CRS1xx/CRS2xx series switches are capable of VLAN filtering based on
the outer tag of tagged packets that have two CVID tags (double CVID tag), these switches are also capable of adding another CVID tag on top of an
existing CVID tag (CVID Stacking). For example, in a setup where ether1 is receiving tagged packets with CVID 10, but it is required that ether2 sends out
these packets with another tag CVID 20 (VLAN10 inside VLAN20) while filtering out any other VLANs, the following must be configured:
Switch together ether1 and ether2:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
```
Set the switch to filter VLANs based on the service tag (0x88a8):
```
/interface ethernet switch
set bridge-type=service-vid-used-as-lookup-vid
```
Add a service tag SVID 20 to packets that have a CVID 10 tag on ether1:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-vlan-translation
add customer-vid=10 new-service-vid=20 ports=ether1
```
Specify ether2 as the tagged/trunk port for SVID 20:
```
/interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=20
```
Allow ether1 and ether2 to forward SVID 20:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2 vlan-id=20
```
Override the SVID EtherType (0x88a8) to CVID EtherType (0x8100) on ether2:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 egress-service-tpid-override=0x8100 ingress-service-tpid-override=0x8100
```
Enable unknown/invalid VLAN filtering:
```
/interface ethernet switch
set drop-if-invalid-or-src-port-not-member-of-vlan-on-ports=ether1,ether2
```
Mirroring
The Cloud Router Switches support three types of mirroring. Port-based mirroring can be applied to any switch-chip ports, VLAN-based mirroring works for
all specified VLANs regardless of switch-chip ports, and MAC-based mirroring copies traffic sent or received from specific device reachable from the port
configured in Unicast Forwarding Database.
Port-Based Mirroring
The first configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port for both ingress and egress mirroring, mirrored traffic will be sent to this port. Port-
based ingress and egress mirroring are enabled from the ether6 port.
```
/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 egress-mirror0=ether5
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 ingress-mirror-to=mirror0 egress-mirror-to=mirror0
```
VLAN Based Mirroring
The second example requires ports to be switched in a group. Mirroring configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port and sets the mirror0
port to be used when mirroring from VLAN occurs. VLAN table entry enables mirroring only for VLAN 300 traffic between ether2 and ether7 ports.
```
Since the switch is set to look up VLAN ID based on the service tag, which is overridden with a different EtherType, then VLAN filtering is only
done on the outer tag of a packet, the inner tag is not checked.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 vlan-uses=mirror0
```
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether2,ether7 vlan-id=300 learn=yes ingress-mirror=yes
```
MAC Based Mirroring
The third configuration also requires ports to be switched in a group. Mirroring configuration sets the ether5 port as a mirror0 analyzer port and sets the
mirror0 port to be used when mirroring from the Unicast Forwarding database occurs. The entry from the Unicast Forwarding database enables mirroring
for packets with source or destination MAC address E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 from ether8 port.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch
set ingress-mirror0=ether5 fdb-uses=mirror0
```
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add port=ether8 mirror=yes svl=yes mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18
```
Trunking
The Trunking in the Cloud Router Switches provides static link aggregation groups with hardware automatic failover and load balancing. IEEE802.3ad and
IEEE802.1ax compatible Link Aggregation Control Protocol is not supported yet. Up to 8 Trunk groups are supported with up to 8 Trunk member ports per
Trunk group.
Configuration requires a group of switched ports and an entry in the Trunk table:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch trunk
add name=trunk1 member-ports=ether6,ether7,ether8
```
This example also shows proper bonding configuration in RouterOS on the other end:
```
/interface bonding
add name=bonding1 slaves=ether2,ether3,ether4 mode=balance-xor transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3
```
Limited MAC Access per Port
Disabling MAC learning and configuring static MAC addresses gives the ability to control what exact devices can communicate to CRS1xx/2xx switches
and through them.
Configuration requires a group of switched ports, disabled MAC learning on those ports, and static UFDB entries:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes learn=no unknown-unicast-flood=no
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes learn=no unknown-unicast-flood=no
```
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=4C:5E:0C:00:00:01 port=ether6 svl=yes
add mac-address=D4:CA:6D:00:00:02 port=ether7 svl=yes
```
```
/interface ethernet switch acl
add action=drop src-mac-addr-state=sa-not-found src-ports=ether6,ether7 table=egress
add action=drop src-mac-addr-state=static-station-move src-ports=ether6,ether7 table=egress
```
CRS1xx/2xx switches also allow to learn one dynamic MAC per port to ensure only one end-user device is connected no matter its MAC address:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 learn-limit=1
set ether7 learn-limit=1
```
Isolation
Port Level Isolation
```
You can find a working example for trunking and port-based VLANs on CRS VLANs with Trunks page.
```
```
Bridge (R)STP is not aware of the underlying switch trunking configuration and some trunk ports can move to a discarding or blocking state.
When trunking member ports are connected to other bridges, you should either disable the (R)STP or filter out any BPDU between trunked
devices (e.g. with ACL rules).
```
Port-level isolation is often used for Private VLAN, where:
```
One or multiple uplink ports are shared among all users for accessing the gateway or router.
Port group Isolated Ports is for guest users. Communication is through the uplink ports only.
Port group Community 0 is for department A. Communication is allowed between the group members and through uplink ports.
Port group Community X is for department X. Communication is allowed between the group members and through uplink ports.
```
The Cloud Router Switches use port-level isolation profiles for Private VLAN implementation:
```
Uplink ports – port-level isolation profile 0
Isolated ports – port-level isolation profile 1
Community 0 ports - port-level isolation profile 2
Community X (X <= 30) ports - port-level isolation profile X
```
This example requires a group of switched ports. Assume that all ports used in this example are in one switch group.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10 hw=yes
```
The first part of port isolation configuration is setting the Uplink port – set a port profile to 0 for ether2:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 isolation-leakage-profile-override=0
```
Then continue with setting isolation profile 1 to all isolated ports and adding the communication port for port isolation profile 1:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether5 isolation-leakage-profile-override=1
set ether6 isolation-leakage-profile-override=1
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=1 ports=ether2 type=dst
```
Configuration to set Community 2 and Community 3 ports is similar:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether8 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=2 ports=ether2,ether7,ether8 type=dst
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether9 isolation-leakage-profile-override=3
set ether10 isolation-leakage-profile-override=3
```
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=3 ports=ether2,ether9,ether10 type=dst
```
Protocol Level Isolation
Protocol level isolation on CRS switches can be used to enhance network security. For example, restricting DHCP traffic between the users and allowing it
only to trusted DHCP server ports can prevent security risks like DHCP spoofing attacks. The following example shows how to configure it on CRS.
Switch together the required ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 hw=yes
```
Set the same Community port profile for all DHCP client ports. Community port profile numbers are from 2 to 30.
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether2 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether3 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether4 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
set ether5 isolation-leakage-profile-override=2
```
And configure port isolation/leakage profile for selected Community (2) to allow DHCP traffic destined only to the port where the trusted DHCP server is
located. registration status and traffic-type properties have to be set empty to apply restrictions only for DHCP protocol.
```
/interface ethernet switch port-isolation
add port-profile=2 protocol-type=dhcpv4 type=dst forwarding-type=bridged ports=ether1 registration-status=""
traffic-type=""
```
Quality of Service (QoS)
QoS configuration schemes
MAC based traffic scheduling and shaping: [MAC address in UFDB] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
VLAN based traffic scheduling and shaping: [VLAN id in VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
Protocol based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Protocol in Protocol VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
PCP/DEI based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Switch port PCP/DEI mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
DSCP based traffic scheduling and shaping: [QoS DSCP mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
MAC-based traffic scheduling using internal Priority
In Strict Priority scheduling mode, the highest priority queue is served first. The queue number represents the priority and the queue with the highest queue
number has the highest priority. Traffic is transmitted from the highest priority queue until the queue is empty, and then moves to the next highest priority
queue, and so on. If no congestion is present at the egress port, a packet is transmitted as soon as it is received. If congestion occurs in the port where
high-priority traffic keeps coming, the lower-priority queues starve.
On all CRS switches the scheme where MAC-based egress traffic scheduling is done according to internal Priority would be the following: [MAC address] -
> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue];
In this example, host1 (E7:16:34:00:00:01) and host2 (E7:16:34:00:00:02) will have higher priority 1 and the rest of the hosts will have lower priority 0 for
transmitted traffic on port ether7. Note that CRS has a maximum of 8 queues per port.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1
```
Add UFDB entries to match specific MACs on ether7 and apply the QoS group1:
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:01 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:02 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
```
Configure ether7 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 qos-scheme-
precedence=da-based
```
MAC-based traffic shaping using internal Priority
The scheme where MAC-based traffic shaping is done according to internal Priority would be following: [MAC address] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] ->
[Queue] -> [Shaper];
In this example, unlimited traffic will have priority 0 and limited traffic will have priority 1 with a bandwidth limit of 10Mbit. Note that CRS has a maximum of
8 queues per port.
Create a group of ports for switching:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1
```
Add UFDB entry to match specific MAC on ether8 and apply QoS group1:
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 port=ether8 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
```
Configure ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 qos-scheme-
precedence=da-based
```
Apply bandwidth limit for queue1 on ether8:
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether8 rate=10M target=queue1
```
If the CRS switch supports Access Control List, this configuration is simpler:
```
/interface ethernet switch acl policer
add name=policer1 yellow-burst=100k yellow-rate=10M
```
```
/interface ethernet switch acl
add mac-dst-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 policer=policer1
```
VLAN-based traffic scheduling + shaping using internal Priorities
The best practice is to assign lower internal QoS Priority for traffic limited by shaper to make it also less important in the Strict Priority scheduler. (higher
priority should be more important and unlimited)
In this example:
Switch port ether6 is using a shaper to limit the traffic that comes from ether7 and ether8.
When the link has reached its capacity, the traffic with the highest priority will be sent out first.
VLAN10 -> QoS group0 = lowest priority
VLAN20 -> QoS group1 = normal priority
VLAN30 -> QoS group2 = highest priority
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create QoS groups for use in the VLAN table.
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group0 priority=0
add name=group1 priority=1
add name=group2 priority=2
```
Add VLAN entries to apply QoS groups for certain VLANs.
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group0 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group1 vlan-id=20
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group2 vlan-id=30
```
Configure ether6, ether7, and ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS schemes only for VLAN-based QoS.
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-
precedence=vlan-based
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-
precedence=vlan-based
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 qos-scheme-
precedence=vlan-based
```
Apply bandwidth limit on ether6.
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether6 rate=10M
```
PCP-based traffic scheduling
By default, CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices will ignore the PCP/CoS/802.1p value and forward packets based on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner. When
the device's internal queue is not full, then packets are sent in a FIFO manner, but as soon as a queue is filled, then higher-priority traffic can be sent out
first. Let us consider a scenario when ether1 and ether2 are forwarding data to ether3, but when ether3 is congested, then packets are going to be
scheduled, we can configure the switch to hold the lowest priority packets until all higher priority packets are sent out, this is a very common scenario for
VoIP type setups, where some traffic needs to be prioritized.
To achieve such a behavior, switch together ether1, ether2, and ether3 ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
```
Enable Strict Policy for each internal queue on each port:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0"
```
Map each PCP value to an internal priority value, for convenience reasons simply map PCP to an internal priority 1-to-1:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 pcp-based-qos-priority-mapping=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7
```
Since the switch will empty the largest queue first and you need the highest priority to be served first, then you can assign this internal priority to a queue 1-
to-1:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7
```
Finally, set each switch port to schedule packets based on the PCP value:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 qos-scheme-precedence=pcp-based
```
Bandwidth Limiting
Both Ingress Port policer and Shaper provide bandwidth-limiting features for CRS switches.
```
Ingress Port Policer sets RX limit on port:
```
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M
```
```
Shaper sets TX limit on port:
```
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M
```
Traffic Storm Control
The same Ingress Port policer also can be used for traffic storm control to prevent disruptions on Layer 2 ports caused by broadcast, multicast, or unicast
traffic storms.
```
Broadcast storm control example on ether5 port with 500 packet limit per second:
```
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=500 meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast
```
```
Example with multiple packet types which includes ARP and ND protocols and unregistered multicast traffic. Unregistered multicast is traffic that
is not defined in the Multicast Forwarding Database.
```
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=5k meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast,arp-or-nd,unregistered-multicast
```

# CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, CCR2216 VLANs with Bonds
```
Summary
Bonding
Port switching
Management IP
Invalid VLAN filtering
InterVLAN routing
DHCP-Server
Jumbo frames
```

## Summary
This page will show how to configure multiple switches to use bonding interfaces and port-based VLANs, it will also show a working example with a DHCP-
Server, inter-VLAN routing, management IP, and invalid VLAN filtering configuration.
For this network topology, we will be using two CRS326-24G-2S+, one CRS317-1G-16S+, and one CCR1072-1G-8S+, but the same principles can be
applied to any CRS3xx, CRS5xx series devices, and a router.
In this setup, SwitchA and SwitchC will tag all traffic from ports ether1-ether8 to VLAN ID 10, ether9-ether16 to VLAN ID 20, and ether17-ether24 to VLAN
ID 30. Management will only be possible if a user is connecting with tagged traffic with VLAN ID 99 from ether1 on SwitchA or SwitchB, connecting to all
devices will also be possible from the router using tagged traffic with VLAN ID 99. The SFP+ ports in this setup are going to be used as VLAN trunk ports
while being in a bond to create a LAG interface.

## Bonding
```
This article applies to CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, and CCR2216 devices. It doesn't apply to CRS1xx/CRS2xx series.
```
Bonding interfaces are used when a larger amount of bandwidth is required, this is done by creating a link aggregation group, which also provides
hardware automatic failover and load balancing for switches. By adding two 10Gbps interfaces to bonding, you can increase the theoretical bandwidth limit
to 20Gbps. Make sure that all bonded interfaces are linked to the same speed rates.
To create a 20Gbps bonding interface from sfp-sfpplus1 and sfp-sfpplus2 between SwitchA to SwitchB and between SwitchC to SwitchB, use these
commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
```
To create a 40Gbps bonding interface between SwitchB and the Router and a 20Gbps bonding interface between SwitchA and SwitchC, use these
commands on SwitchB:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_3-4 slaves=sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_5-6-7-8 slaves=sfp-sfpplus5,sfp-sfpplus6,sfp-sfpplus7,sfp-sfpplus8
```
In our case the Router needs a software-based bonding interface, use these commands on the Router:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond_1-2-3-4 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2,sfp-sfpplus3,sfp-sfpplus4
```
Port switching
All switches in this setup require that all used ports are switched together. For bonding, you should add the bonding interface as a bridge port, instead of
individual bonding ports. Use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
```
When using the hardware-offloaded bridge, the CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, and CCR2216 devices aggregate traffic using the built-in switch
chip without using CPU resources. To route the traffic a router with a powerful CPU is required to handle the aggregated traffic.
```
```
Interface bonding does not create an interface with a larger link speed. Interface bonding creates a virtual interface that can load balance traffic
over multiple interfaces. More details can be found on the LAG interfaces and load balancing page.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether5 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether6 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether7 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether8 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge interface=ether9 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether10 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether11 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether12 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether13 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether14 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether15 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether16 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether17 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether18 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether19 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether20 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether21 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether22 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether23 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether24 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_1-2
```
Add all bonding interfaces to a single bridge on SwitchB by using these commands on SwitchB:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_1-2
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_3-4
add bridge=bridge interface=bond_5-6-7-8
```
Management IP
It is very useful to create a management interface and assign an IP address to it to preserve access to the switch. This is also very useful when updating
your switches since such traffic to the switch will be blocked when enabling invalid VLAN filtering.
Create a routable VLAN interface on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge name=MGMT vlan-id=99
```
The Router needs a routable VLAN interface to be created on the bonding interface, use these commands to create a VLAN interface on the Router:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
```
For this guide, we are going to use these addresses for each device:
```
Device Address
```
```
Router 192.168.99.1
```
```
SwitchA 192.168.99.2
```
```
SwitchB 192.168.99.3
```
```
SwitchC 192.168.99.4
```
Add an IP address for each switch device on the VLAN interface (change X to the appropriate number):
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.X/24 interface=MGMT
```
Do not forget to add the default gateway and specify a DNS server on the switch devices:
```
/ip route
add gateway=192.168.99.1
/ip dns
set servers=192.168.99.1
```
Add the IP address on the Router:
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
Invalid VLAN filtering
Since most ports on SwitchA and SwitchC are going to be access ports, you can set all ports to accept only certain types of packets, in this case, we will
want SwitchA and SwitchC to only accept untagged packets, use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
```
/interface bridge port
set [ find ] frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged
```
There is an exception for frame types on SwitchA and SwitchC, in this setup access to the management is required from ether1 and bonding interfaces,
they require that tagged traffic can be forwarded. Use these commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether1] frame-types=admit-all
set [find where interface=bond_1-2] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
On SwitchB only tagged packets should be forwarded, use these commands on SwitchB:
```
/interface bridge port
set [ find ] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
An optional step is to set frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged on the bridge interface to disable the default untagged VLAN 1 (pvid=1). We are
using the tagged VLAN on the bridge for management access, so there is no need to accept untagged traffic on the bridge. Use these commands on the S
witchA, SwitchB and SwitchC:
```
/interface bridge set [find name=bridge] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
It is required to set up a bridge VLAN table. In this network setup, we need to allow VLAN 10 on ether1-ether8, VLAN 20 on ether9-ether16, VLAN 30 on
ether17-ether24, VLAN 10,20,30,99 on bond_1-2, and a special case for ether1 to allow to forward VLAN 99 on SwitchA and SwitchC. Use these
commands on SwitchA and SwitchC:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2 vlan-ids=30
add bridge=bridge tagged=bridge,bond_1-2,ether1 vlan-ids=99
```
Similarly, it is required to set up a bridge VLAN table for SwitchB. Use these commands on SwitchB:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2,bond_3-4,bond_5-6-7-8 vlan-ids=10,20,30
add bridge=bridge tagged=bond_1-2,bond_3-4,bond_5-6-7-8,bridge vlan-ids=99
```
When everything is configured, VLAN filtering can be enabled. Use these commands on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
```
/interface bridge
set bridge vlan-filtering=yes
```


# InterVLAN routing
To create InterVLAN routing, the VLAN interface for each customer VLAN ID must be created on the router and must have an IP address assigned to it.
The VLAN interface must be created on the bonding interface created previously.
Use these commands on the Router:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN20 vlan-id=20
add interface=bond_1-2-3-4 name=VLAN30 vlan-id=30
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=VLAN10
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=VLAN20
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=VLAN30
```

## DHCP-Server
```
Bridge ports with frame-types set to admit-all or admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged will be automatically added as
untagged ports for the pvid VLAN.
```
```
Double-check if port-based VLANs are set up properly. If a mistake was made, you might lose access to the switch and it can only be regained
by resetting the configuration or by using the serial console.
```
```
VLAN filtering is described more in the Bridge VLAN Filtering section.
```
```
These commands are required for DHCP-Server. In case interVLAN routing is not desired but a DHCP-Server on a single router is required,
then use Firewall Filter to block access between different subnets.
```
```
Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using the L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details on L3 Hardware Offloading.
```
To get the DHCP-Server working for each VLAN ID, the server must be set up on the previously created VLAN interfaces (one server for each VLAN ID).
Preferably each VLAN ID should have its own subnet and its own IP pool. A DNS Server could be specified as the router's IP address for a particular
VLAN ID or a global DNS Server could be used, but this address must be reachable.
To set up the DHCP-Server, use these commands on the Router:
```
/ip pool
add name=VLAN10_POOL ranges=192.168.10.100-192.168.10.200
add name=VLAN20_POOL ranges=192.168.20.100-192.168.20.200
add name=VLAN30_POOL ranges=192.168.30.100-192.168.30.200
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=VLAN10_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN10 name=VLAN10_DHCP
add address-pool=VLAN20_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN20 name=VLAN20_DHCP
add address-pool=VLAN30_POOL disabled=no interface=VLAN30 name=VLAN30_DHCP
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=192.168.10.1 gateway=192.168.10.1
add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=192.168.20.1 gateway=192.168.20.1
add address=192.168.30.0/24 dns-server=192.168.30.1 gateway=192.168.30.1
```
In case the router's DNS Server is being used, don't forget to allow remote requests and make sure DNS Servers are configured on the router. Use these
commands on the Router:
```
/ip dns
set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8
```
Don't forget to create NAT, assuming that sfp-sfpplus8 is used as WAN port, use these commands on the Router:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=sfp-sfpplus8
```
Jumbo frames
One can increase the total throughput in such a setup by enabling jumbo frames. This reduces the packet overhead by increasing the Maximum
Transmission Unit (MTU). If a device in your network does not support jumbo frames, then it will not benefit from a larger MTU. Usually, the whole network
does not support jumbo frames, but you can still benefit when sending data between devices that support jumbo frames, including all switches in the path.
In this case, if clients behind SwitchA and client behind SwitchC support jumbo frames, then enabling jumbo frames will be beneficial. Before enabling
jumbo frames, determine the MAX-L2MTU by using this command:
```
[admin@SwitchA] > interface print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, TYPE, ACTUAL-MTU, L2MTU, MAX-L2MTU, MAC-ADDRESS
# NAME TYPE ACTUAL-MTU L2MTU MAX-L2MTU MAC-ADDRESS
1 R sfp-sfpplus1 ether 1500 1584 10218 64:D1:54:FF:E3:7F
```
When MAX-L2MTU is determined, choose the MTU size depending on the traffic on your network, use this command on SwitchA, SwitchB, and SwitchC:
```
/interface ethernet
set [ find ] l2mtu=10218 mtu=10218
```
```
Make sure to secure your local DNS Server with Firewall from the outside when using allow-remote-requests set to yes since your DNS
Server can be used for DDoS attacks if it is accessible from the Internet by anyone.
```
```
More information can be found in MTU manual page.
```
Don't forget to change the MTU on your client devices too, otherwise, the above-mentioned settings will not have any effect.

Introduction
There are certain configurations that are known to have major flaws by design and should be avoided by all means possible. Misconfigured Layer2 can
sometimes cause hard to detect network errors, random performance drops, certain segments of a network to be unreachable, certain networking services
to be malfunctioning, or a complete network failure. This page will contain some common and not so very common configurations that will cause issues in
your network.
Bridges on a single switch chip
Consider the following scenario, you have a device with a built-in switch chip and you need to isolate certain ports from each other, for this reason, you
have created multiple bridges and enabled hardware offloading on them. Since each bridge is located on a different Layer2 domain, then Layer2 frames
will not be forwarded between these bridges, as a result, ports in each bridge are isolated from other ports on a different bridge.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
add name=bridge2
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether4
```
Problem
After a simple performance test, you might notice that one bridge is capable of forwarding traffic at wire speed while the second, third, etc. bridge is not
able to forward as much data as the first bridge. Another symptom might be that there exists a huge latency for packets that need to be routed. After a
quick inspection, you might notice that the CPU is always at full load, this is because hardware offloading is not available on all bridges, but is available
only on one bridge. By checking the hardware offloading status you will notice that only one bridge has it active:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
# INTERFACE BRIDGE HW
0 H ether1 bridge1 yes
1 H ether2 bridge1 yes
2 ether3 bridge2 yes
3 ether4 bridge2 yes
```
The reason why only one bridge has the hardware offloading flag available is that the device does not support port isolation. If port isolation is not
supported, then only one bridge will be able to offload the traffic to the switch chip.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Missing "H" flag to bridge ports
Low throughput
High CPU usage
```
Solution
Not all device devices support port isolation, currently only CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices support it and only 7 isolated and hardware offloaded bridges
are supported at the same time, other devices will have to use the CPU to forward the packets on other bridges. This is usually a hardware limitation and a
different device might be required. Bridge split-horizon parameter is a software feature that disables hardware offloading and when using bridge filter rules
you need to enable forward all packets to the CPU, which requires the hardware offloading to be disabled. You can control which bridge will be hardware
offloaded with the hw=yes flag and by setting hw=no to other bridges, for example:
```
/interface bridge port set [find where bridge=bridge1] hw=no
/interface bridge port set [find where bridge=bridge2] hw=yes
```
Sometimes it is possible to restructure a network topology to use VLANs, which is the proper way to isolate Layer2 networks.
Packet flow with hardware offloading and MAC learning
Consider the following scenario, you set up a bridge and have enabled hardware offloading in order to maximize the throughput for your device, as a
result, your device is working as a switch, but you want to use Sniffer or Torch tools for debugging purposes, or maybe you want to implement packet
logging.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 hw=yes interface=ether1 learn=yes
add bridge=bridge1 hw=yes interface=ether2 learn=yes
```
Problem
When running Sniffer or Torch tools to capture packets you might notice that barely any packets are visible, only some unicast packets, but mostly
broadcast/multicast packets are captured, while the interfaces report that much larger traffic is flowing through certain interfaces than the traffic that was
captured. If you add two or more Ethernet interfaces to a bridge and enable Hardware Offloading, then the switch chip will be used to forward packets
between ports. To understand why only some packets are captured, we must first examine how the switch chip is interconnected with the CPU, in this
example, we can use a block diagram from a generic 5-Port Ethernet router:
For this device, each Ethernet port is connected to the switch chip and the switch chip is connected to the CPU using the CPU port (sometimes called the s
witch-cpu port). For packets to be visible in Sniffer or Torch tools, the packet must be sent from an Ethernet port to the CPU port, this means that the
packet must be destined to the CPU port (destination MAC address of the packet matches the bridge's MAC address) or the packet's MAC address has
not be learnt (packet is flooded to all ports), this behavior is because of MAC learning·
The switch chip keeps a list of MAC addresses and ports called the Host table· Whenever a packet needs to be forwarded, the switch chip checks the
packet's destination MAC address against the hosts table to find which port should it use to forward the packet. If the switch chip cannot find the
destination MAC address, then the packet is flooded to all ports (including the CPU port). In situations where a packet is supposed to be forwarded from,
for example, ether1 to ether2 and the MAC address for the device behind ether2 is in the host table, then the packet is never sent to the CPU and
therefore will not be visible to Sniffer or Torch tool.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Packets not visible by Sniffer or Torch tool
Filter rules not working
```
Solution
Packets with a destination MAC address that has been learned will not be sent to the CPU since the packets are not being flooded to all ports. If you do
need to send certain packets to the CPU for a packet analyzer or a firewall, then it is possible to copy or redirect the packet to the CPU by using ACL rules.
Below is an example of how to send a copy of packets that are meant for 4C:5E:0C:4D:12:4B:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add copy-to-cpu=yes dst-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:4B/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF ports=ether1 switch=switch1
```


# LAG interfaces and load balancing
Consider the following scenario, you have created a LAG interface to increase total bandwidth between 2 network nodes, usually, these are switches. For
testing purposes to make sure that the LAG interface is working properly you have attached two servers that transfer data, most commonly the well-known
network performance measurement tool https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf is used to test such setups. For example, you might have made a LAG interface
out of two Gigabit Ethernet ports, which gives you a virtual interface that can load balance traffic over both interfaces and theoretically reach 2Gbps
throughput, while the servers are connected using a 10Gbps interface, for example, SFP+.

## Configuration
The following configuration is relevant to SW1 and SW2:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=bond1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1
```

## Problem
After initial tests, you immediately notice that your network throughput never exceeds the 1Gbps limit even though the CPU load on the servers is low as
well as on the network nodes (switches in this case), but the throughput is still limited to only 1Gbps. The reason behind this is because LACP (802.ad)
uses transmit hash policy in order to determine if traffic can be balanced over multiple LAG members, in this case, a LAG interface does not create a
2Gbps interface, but rather an interface that can balance traffic over multiple slave interface whenever it is possible. For each packet a transmit hash is
generated, this determines through which LAG member will the packet be sent, this is needed in order to avoid packets being out of order, there is an
option to select the transmit hash policy, usually, there is an option to choose between Layer2 (MAC), Layer3 (IP) and Layer4 (Port), in RouterOS, this can
be selected by using the transmit-hash-policy parameter. In this case, the transmit hash is the same since you are sending packets to the same
destination MAC address, as well as the same IP address and Iperf uses the same port as well, this generates the same transmit hash for all packets and
load balancing between LAG members is not possible. Note that not always packets will get balanced over LAG members even though the destination is
different, this is because the standardized transmit hash policy can generate the same transmit hash for different destinations, for example, 192.168.0.1
/192.168.0.2 will get balanced, but 192.168.0.2/192.168.0.4 will NOT get balanced in case layer2-and-3 transmit hash policy is used and the
destination MAC address is the same.
```
If the packet is sent to the CPU, then the packet must be processed by the CPU, this increases the CPU load.
```
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Traffic going through only one LAG member
```
Solution
Choose the proper transmit hash policy and test your network's throughput properly. The simplest way to test such setups is to use multiple destinations,
for example, instead of sending data to just one server, rather send data to multiple servers, this will generate a different transmit hash for each packet and
will make load balancing across LAG members possible. For some setups, you might want to change the bonding interface mode to increase the total
throughput, for UDP traffic balance-rr mode might be sufficient, but can cause issues for TCP traffic, you can read more about selecting the right mode
for your setup here.
VLAN interface on a slave interface
Consider the following scenario, you have created a bridge and you want a DHCP Server to give out IP addresses only to a certain tagged VLAN traffic, for
this reason, you have created a VLAN interface, specified a VLAN ID and created a DHCP Server on it, but for some reason, it is not working properly.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
/interface vlan
add name=VLAN99 interface=ether1 vlan-id=99
/ip pool
add name=VLAN99_POOL range=192.168.99.100-192.168.99.200
/ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=VLAN99
/ip dhcp-server
add interface=VLAN99 address-pool=VLAN99_POOL disabled=no
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.99.0/24 gateway=192.168.99.1 dns-server=192.168.99.1
```
Problem
When you add an interface to a bridge, the bridge becomes the master interface and all bridge ports become slave ports, this means that all traffic that is
received on a bridge port is captured by the bridge interface and all traffic is forwarded to the CPU using the bridge interface instead of the physical
interface. As a result VLAN interface that is created on a slave interface will never capture any traffic at all since it is immediately forwarded to the master
interface before any packet processing is being done. The usual side effect is that some DHCP clients receive IP addresses and some don't.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
DHCP Client/Server not working properly;
Device is unreachable;
The device behind a bridge is unreachable with tagged traffic;
```
Solution
Change the interface on which the VLAN interface will be listening for traffic, change it to the master interface:
```
/interface vlan set VLAN99 interface=bridge1
```
VLAN on a bridge in a bridge
Consider the following scenario, you have a set of interfaces (don't have to be physical interfaces) and you want all of them to be in the same Layer2
segment, the solution is to add them to a single bridge, but you require that traffic from one port tags all traffic into a certain VLAN. This can be done by
creating a VLAN interface on top of the bridge interface and by creating a separate bridge that contains this newly created VLAN interface and an
interface, which is supposed to add a VLAN tag to all received traffic. A network diagram can be found below:
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
add name=bridge2
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN vlan-id=99
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge2 interface=VLAN
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether3
```
Problem
To better understand the underlying problems, let's first look at the bridge host table.
```
[admin@switch] /interface bridge host print where !local
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - external
# MAC-ADDRESS VID ON-INTERFACE BRIDGE
0 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A1 ether1 bridge1
1 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A2 ether2 bridge1
2 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A1 VLAN bridge2
3 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A2 VLAN bridge2
4 D CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:A3 ether3 bridge2
```
Devices on ether1 and ether2 need to send tagged packets with VLAN-ID 99 in order to reach the host on ether3 (other packets do not get passed towards
VLAN interface and further bridged with ether3). We can see in the host table that bridge2 has learned these hosts. Packets coming from ether3 to ether1 w
ill be correctly sent out tagged and traffic will not be flooded in bridge1. But since MAC learning is only possible between bridge ports and not on interfaces
that are created on top of the bridge interface, packets sent from ether2 to ether3 will be flooded in bridge1.
Also if a device behind ether3 is using (R)STP, then ether1 and ether2 will send out tagged BPDUs which violates the IEEE 802.1W standard. Because of
the broken MAC learning functionality and broken (R)STP this setup and configuration must be avoided. It is also known that in some setups this kind of
configuration can prevent you from connecting to the device by using MAC telnet.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Port blocked by RSTP
Loops in network
```
```
Port flapping
Traffic is flooded to all ports
MAC telnet is unable to connect
Device inaccessible
```
Solution
Use bridge VLAN filtering. The proper way to tag traffic is to assign a VLAN ID whenever traffic enters a bridge, this behavior can easily be achieved by
specifying PVID value for a bridge port and specifying which ports are tagged (trunk) ports and which are untagged (access) ports. Below is an example of
how such a setup should have been configured:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
VLAN in a bridge with a physical interface
Very similar case to VLAN on a bridge in a bridge. The most popular use case is when you want to bridge a physical interface with a VLAN (simplified trunk
/access port setup). In such setup you might want to send out tagged traffic on one side and untagged on the other side. To acomplish this, you create a
VLAN interface on the trunk port (the tagged side), then create a bridge and add both the VLAN interface and the physical interface (the untagged side) as
bridge ports.
Configuration
```
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=VLAN99 vlan-id=99
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
add interface=VLAN99 bridge=bridge1
```
Problem
This setup and configuration will work in most cases, but it violates the IEEE 802.1W standard when (R/M)STP is used. If this is the only device in your
Layer2 domain, then this should not cause problems, but problems can arise when there are other vendor switches. The reason for this is that RSTP on a
bridge interface is enabled by default, allowing Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to be sent from each bridge port. While ether2 transmits BPDUs
correctly without tagging, VLAN99 interface, being a bridge port, sends tagged BPDUs over ether1. Not all switches can understand tagged
BPDUs.  Precautions should be made with this configuration in a more complex network where there are multiple network topologies for certain (group of)
VLANs, this is relevant to MSTP and PVSTP(+) with mixed vendor devices. In a ring-like topology with multiple network topologies for certain VLANs, one
port from the switch will be blocked, but in MSTP and PVSTP(+) a path can be opened for a certain VLAN, in such a situation it is possible that devices
that don't support PVSTP(+) will untag the BPDUs and forward the BPDU, as a result, the switch will receive its own packet, trigger a loop detection and
block a port, this can happen to other protocols as well, but (R)STP is the most common case. If a switch is using a BPDU guard function, then this type of
configuration can trigger it and cause a port to be blocked by STP. It has been reported that this type of configuration can prevent traffic from being
forwarded over certain bridge ports over time when using 6.41 or later. This type of configuration does not only break (R/M)STP, but it can cause loop
warnings, this can be caused by MNDP packets or any other packets that are directly sent out from an interface.
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Port blocked by RSTP
Loops in network
Port flapping
Traffic stops forwarding over time
BPDUs ignored by other RSTP enabled devices
```
Solution
To avoid compatibility issues you should use bridge VLAN filtering. Below you can find an example of how the same traffic tagging effect can be achieved
with a bridge VLAN filtering configuration:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=99
```
Bridged VLAN on physical interfaces
A very similar case to VLAN on a bridge in a bridge, consider the following scenario, you have a couple of switches in your network and you are using
VLANs to isolate certain Layer2 domains and connect these switches to a router that assigns addresses and routes the traffic to the world. For
redundancy, you connect all switches directly to the router and have enabled RSTP, but to be able to setup DHCP Server you decide that you can create a
VLAN interface for each VLAN on each physical interface that is connected to a switch and add these VLAN interfaces in a bridge. A network diagram can
be found below:
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
Configuration
Only the router part is relevant to this case, switch configuration doesn't really matter as long as ports are switched. Router configuration can be found
below:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge10
add name=bridge20
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v20 vlan-id=20
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v20 vlan-id=20
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge10 interface=ether1_v10
add bridge=bridge10 interface=ether2_v10
add bridge=bridge20 interface=ether1_v20
add bridge=bridge20 interface=ether2_v20
```
Problem
You might notice that the network is having some weird delays or even the network is unresponsive, you might notice that there is a loop detected (packet
received with own MAC address) and some traffic is being generated out of nowhere. The problem occurs because a broadcast packet that is coming from
either one of the VLAN interface created on the Router will be sent out the physical interface, packet will be forwarded through the physical interface,
through a switch and will be received back on a different physical interface, in this case, broadcast packets sent out ether1_v10 will be received on ether2,
packet will be captured by ether2_v10, which is bridged with ether1_v10 and will get forwarded again the same path (loop). (R)STP might not always
detect this loop since (R)STP is not aware of any VLANs, a loop does not exist with untagged traffic, but exists with tagged traffic. In this scenario, it is
quite obvious to spot the loop, but in more complex setups it is not always easy to detect the network design flaw. Sometimes this network design flaw
might get unnoticed for a very long time if your network does not use broadcast traffic, usually, Neighbor Discovery Protocol is broadcasting packets from
the VLAN interface and will usually trigger a loop detection in such a setup. Sometimes it is useful to capture the packet that triggered a loop detection, this
can by using sniffer and analyzing the packet capture file:
```
/tool sniffer
set filter-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF \
filter-interface=ether1 filter-direction=rx file-name=loop_packet.pcap
```
Or a more convenient way using logging:
```
/interface bridge filter
add action=log chain=forward src-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
add action=log chain=input src-mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:44/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
```
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Port blocked by (R)STP;
Loops in network;
Low throughput;
Port flapping;
Network inaccessible;
```
Solution
A solution is to use bridge VLAN filtering in order to make all bridges compatible with IEEE 802.1W and IEEE 802.1Q.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2,bridge vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2,bridge vlan-ids=20
/interface vlan
add name=vlan10 interface=bridge vlan-id=10
add name=vlan20 interface=bridge vlan-id=20
```
Bridged VLAN
A more simplified scenario of Bridged VLAN on physical interfaces, but in this case, you simply want to bridge two or more VLANs together that are
created on different physical interfaces. This is a very common type of setup that deserves a separate article since misconfiguring this type of setup has
caused multiple network failures. This type of setup is also used for VLAN translation.
Configuration
```
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=ether1_v10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether2 name=ether2_v10 vlan-id=10
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1_v10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2_v10
```
Problem
You may notice that certain parts of the network are not accessible and/or certain links keep flapping. This is due to (R)STP, this type of configuration
forces the device to send out tagged BPDUs, that might not be supported by other devices, including RouterOS. Since a device receives a malformed
packet (tagged BPDUs should not exist in your network when running (R)STP, this violates IEEE 802.1W and IEEE 802.1Q), the device will not interpret
the packet correctly and can have unexpected behavior.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Port blocked by (R)STP;
Port flapping;
Network inaccessible;
```
Solution
The easiest solution is to simply disable (R)STP on the bridge:
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 protocol-mode=none
```
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
though it is still recommended to rewrite your configuration to use bridge VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2 vlan-ids=10
```
Bridge VLAN filtering on non-CRS3xx
Consider the following scenario, you found out the new bridge VLAN filtering feature and you decided to change the configuration on your device, you have
a very simple trunk/access port setup and you like the concept of bridge VLAN filtering.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=20
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=30
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=40
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=30
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=40
```
Problem
For example, you use this configuration on a CRS1xx/CRS2xx series device and you started to notice that the CPU usage is very high and when running a
performance test to check the network's throughput you notice that the total throughput is only a fraction of the wire-speed performance that it should easily
reach. The cause of the problem is that not all devices support bridge VLAN filtering on a hardware level. All devices are able to be configured with bridge
VLAN filtering, but only a few of them will be able to offload the traffic to the switch chip. If an improper configuration method is used on a device with a
built-in switch chip, then the CPU will be used to forward the traffic.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Missing "H" flag on bridge ports
Low throughput
High CPU usage
```
Solution
Before using bridge VLAN filtering check if your device supports it at the hardware level, a table with compatibility can be found at the Bridge Hardware
Offloading section. Each type of device currently requires a different configuration method, below is a list of which configuration should be used on a
device in order to use the benefits of hardware offloading:
```
By enabling vlan-filtering you will be filtering out traffic destined to the CPU, before enabling VLAN filtering you should make sure that you
set up a Management port.
```
```
CRS3xx series devices
CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices
Other devices with a switch chip
```
VLAN filtering with multiple switch chips
Consider the following scenario, you have a device with two or more switch chips and you have decided to use a single bridge and set up VLAN filtering
(by using the /interface ethernet switch menu) on a hardware level to be able to reach wire-speed performance on your network. This is very
relevant for RB2011 and RB3011 series devices. In this example, let's assume that you want to have a single trunk port and all other ports are access
ports, for example, ether10 is our trunk port and ether1-ether9 are our access ports.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether9
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether10
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip
vlan-mode=secure
set ether10 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure
set switch1-cpu,switch2-cpu vlan-mode=secure
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9,ether10,switch2-cpu switch=switch2 vlan-id=10
```
Problem
After running a few tests you might notice that packets from ether6-ether10 are forwarded as expected, but packets from ether1-ether5 are not always
forwarded correctly (especially through the trunk port). The most noticeable issue would be that packets from ether1-ether5 through ether10 are simply
dropped, this is because these ports are located on different switch chip, this means that VLAN filtering is not possible on a hardware level since the switch
chip is not aware of the VLAN table's contents on a different switch chip. Packets that are being forwarded between ports that are located on different
switch chips are also processed by the CPU, which means you won't be able to achieve wire-speed performance.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Packets being dropped;
Low throughput;
```
Solution
The proper solution is to take into account this hardware design and plan your network topology accordingly. To solve this issue you must create two
separate bridges and configure VLAN filtering on each switch chip, this limits the possibility to forward packets between switch chip, though it is possible to
configure routing between both bridges (if devices that are connected on each switch chip are using different network subnets).
There is a way to configure the device to have all ports switch together and yet be able to use VLAN filtering on a hardware level, though this solution has
some caveats. The idea is to sacrifice a single Ethernet port on each switch chip that will act as a trunk port to forward packets between switch chip, this
can be done by plugging an Ethernet cable between both switch chip, for example, lets plug in an Ethernet cable between ether5 and ether6 then
reconfigure your device assuming that these ports are trunk ports:
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether6
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether7
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether8
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether9
add bridge=bridge2 interface=ether10
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether7,ether8,ether9 default-vlan-id=10 vlan-header=always-strip vlan-
mode=secure
set ether5,ether6,ether10 vlan-header=add-if-missing vlan-mode=secure default-vlan-id=auto
set switch1-cpu,switch2-cpu vlan-mode=secure
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5,switch1-cpu switch=switch1 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8,ether9,ether10,switch2-cpu switch=switch2 vlan-id=10
```
VLAN filtering with simplified bridge VLAN table
You need to create a network setup where multiple clients are connected to separate access ports and isolated by different VLANs, this traffic should be
tagged and sent to the appropriate trunk port. Access ports are configured using a pvid property. As the trunk port is used on both VLANs, you decided to
simplify configuration by adding a single bridge VLAN table entry and separate VLANs by a comma. This is especially useful when tagged trunk ports are
used across large numbers of VLANs or even certain VLAN ranges (e.g. vlan-id=100-200). See a network diagram and configuration below.
Configuration
```
For 100Mbps switch chips, use default-vlan-id=0 instead of default-vlan-id=auto
```
```
This issue has been resolved since RouterOS v7.15. Dynamic VLANs are now always created as separate entries and no longer merge with
statically configured ones.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=20
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=10,20
```
Problem
Traffic is correctly forwarded and tagged from access ports to trunk port, but you might notice that some broadcast or multicast packets are actually
flooded between both untagged access ports, although they should be on different VLANs. Furthermore, broadcast and multicast traffic from the tagged
port is also flooded to both access ports. This might raise some security concerns as traffic from different networks can be sniffed. When you look at the
bridge VLAN table, you notice that a single entry has been created for VLANs 10 and 20, and both untagged ports are part of the same VLAN group.
```
[admin@SW1] /interface bridge vlan print where tagged=ether2
Columns: BRIDGE, VLAN-IDS, CURRENT-TAGGED, CURRENT-UNTAGGED
# BRIDGE VLAN-IDS CURRENT-TAGGED CURRENT-UNTAGGED
;;; port with pvid added to untagged group which might cause problems, consider adding a separate VLAN entry
0 bridge1 10 ether2 ether3
20 ether4
```
Symptoms
```
Traffic is flooded between different VLANs
Red warning: port with pvid added to untagged group which might cause problems, consider adding a separate
VLAN entry
```
Solution
When access ports have been configured using the pvid property, they get dynamically added to the appropriate VLAN entry. After creating a static VLAN
entry with multiple VLANs or VLAN range, the untagged access port with a matching pvid also gets included in the same VLAN group or range. It might be
useful to define a large number of VLANs using a single configuration line, but extra caution should be taken when access ports are configured. For this
example, separate VLAN entries should be created:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether3 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=20
```
MTU on the master interface
Consider the following scenario, you have created a bridge, added a few interfaces to it and have created a VLAN interface on top of the bridge interface,
but you need to increase the MTU size on the VLAN interface in order to receive larger packets.
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN99 vlan-id=99
```
Problem
As soon as you try to increase the MTU size on the VLAN interface, you receive an error that RouterOS Could not set MTU. This can happen when you
are trying to set MTU larger than the L2MTU. In this case, you need to increase the L2MTU size on all slave interfaces, which will update the L2MTU size
on the bridge interface. After this has been done, you will be able to set a larger MTU on the VLAN interface. The same principle applies to bond
interfaces. You can increase the MTU on interfaces like VLAN, MPLS, VPLS, Bonding and other interfaces only when all physical slave interfaces have
proper L2MTU set.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Cannot change MTU
```
Solution
Increase the L2MTU on slave interfaces before changing the MTU on a master interface.
```
/interface ethernet
set ether1,ether2 l2mtu=9018
/interface vlan
set VLAN99 mtu=9000
```
MTU inconsistency
Consider the following scenario, you have multiple devices in your network, most of them are used as a switch/bridge in your network and there are certain
endpoints that are supposed to receive and process traffic. To decrease the overhead in your network, you have decided to increase the MTU size so you
set a larger MTU size on both endpoints, but you start to notice that some packets are being dropped.
Configuration
In this case, both endpoints can be any type of device, we will assume that they are both Linux servers that are supposed to transfer a large amount of
data. In such a scenario, you would have probably set interface MTU to 9000 on ServerA and ServerB and on your Switch you have probably have set
something similar to this:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
```
Problem
This is a very simple problem, but in larger networks, it can be hard to detect. For instance, ping might be working since a generic ping packet will be 70
bytes long (14 bytes for Ethernet header, 20 bytes for IPv4 header, 8 bytes for ICMP header, 28 bytes for ICMP payload), but data transfer might not work
properly. The reason why some packets might not get forwarded is that MikroTik devices running RouterOS by default have MTU set to 1500 and L2MTU
set to something around 1580 bytes (depends on the device), but the Ethernet interface will silently drop anything that does not fit into the L2MTU size.
Note that the L2MTU parameter is not relevant to x86 or CHR devices. For a device that is only supposed to forward packets, there is no need to increase
the MTU size, it is only required to increase the L2MTU size, RouterOS will not allow you to increase the MTU size that is larger than the L2MTU size. If
you require the packet to be received on the interface and the device needs to process this packet rather than just forwarding it, for example, in the case of
routing, then it is required to increase the L2MTU and the MTU size, but you can leave the MTU size on the interface to the default value if you are using
only IP traffic (that supports packet fragmentation) and don't mind that packets are being fragmented. You can use the ping utility to make sure that all
devices are able to forward jumbo frames:
```
/ping 192.168.88.1 size=9000 do-not-fragment
```
Remember that the L2MTU and MTU size needs to be larger or equal to the ping packet size on the device from which and to which you are sending a
ping packet since ping (ICMP) is IP traffic that is sent out from an interface over Layer3.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Web pages are not able to load up, but ping works properly;
Tunnels dropping traffic;
Specific protocols are broken;
Large packet loss;
```
Solution
Increase the L2MTU size on your Switch:
```
/interface ethernet
set ether1,ether2 l2mtu=9000
```
In case your traffic is encapsulated (VLAN, VPN, MPLS, VPLS, or other), then you might need to consider setting an even larger L2MTU size. In this
scenario, it is not needed to increase the MTU size for the reason described above.
Bridge and reserved MAC addresses
Consider the following scenario, you want to transparently bridge two network segments together, either those are tunnel interfaces like EoIP, Wireless
interfaces, Ethernet interface, or any other kind of interfaces that can be added to a bridge. Such a setup allows you to seamlessly connect two devices
together like there was only a physical cable between them, this is sometimes called a transparent bridge from DeviceA to DeviceB.
Configuration
For both devices DeviceA and DeviceB there should be a very similar configuration.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=rstp
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=eoip1 bridge=bridge1
```
```
Full frame MTU is not the same as L2MTU. L2MTU size does not include the Ethernet header (14 bytes) and the CRC checksum (FCS) field.
The FCS field is stripped by the Ethernet's driver and RouterOS will never show the extra 4 bytes to any packet. For example, if you set MTU
and L2MTU to 9000, then the full-frame MTU is 9014 bytes long, this can also be observed when sniffing packets with "/tool sniffer
quick" command.
```
Problem
Both devices are able to communicate with each other, but some protocols do not work properly. The reason is that as soon as you use any STP variant
(STP, RSTP, MSTP), you make the bridge compliant with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q, these standards recommend that packets that are destined to 01
:80:C2:00:00:0X should NOT be forwarded. In cases where there are only 2 ports added to a bridge (R/M)STP should not be used since a loop cannot
occur from 2 interfaces and if a loop does occur, the cause is elsewhere and should be fixed on a different bridge. Since (R/M)STP is not needed in
transparent bridge setups, it can be disabled. As soon as (R/M)STP is disabled, the RouterOS bridge is not compliant with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q
and therefore will forward packets that are destined to 01:80:C2:00:00:0X.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
LLDP neighbors not showing up;
802.1x authentication (dot1x) not working;
LACP interface not passing traffic;
```
Solution
It is possible to partly disable compliance with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q, this can be done by changing the bridge protocol mode.
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 protocol-mode=none
```
Bonding between Wireless links
Consider the following scenario, you have set up multiple Wireless links and to achieve maximum throughput and yet to achieve redundancy you have
decided to place Ethernet interfaces into a bond and depending on the traffic that is being forwarded you have chosen a certain bonding mode. This
scenario can be applied to any case, where a bonding interface is created between links, that are not directly connected to each other.
Configuration
```
The IEEE 802.1x standard is meant to be used between a switch and a client directly. If it is possible to connect a device between the switch
and the client, then this creates a security threat. For this reason, it is not recommended to disable the compliance with IEEE 802.1D and IEEE
802.1Q, but rather design a proper network topology.
```
The following configuration is relevant to R1 and R2:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bond1
```
While the following configuration is relevant to AP1, AP2, ST1, and ST2, where X corresponds to an IP address for each device.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
add interface=wlan1 bridge=bridge1
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bridge1
```
Problem
While traffic is being forwarded properly between R1 and R2, load balancing, link failover is working properly as well, but devices between R1 and R2 are
not always accessible or some of them are completely inaccessible (in most cases AP2 and ST2 are inaccessible). After examining the problem you might
notice that packets do not always get forwarded over the required bonding slave and as a result, never is received by the device you are trying to access.
This is a network design and bonding protocol limitation. As soon as a packet needs to be sent out through a bonding interface (in this case you might be
trying to send ICMP packets to AP2 or ST2), the bonding interface will create a hash based on the selected bonding mode and transmit-hash-policy and
will select an interface, through which to send the packet out, regardless of the destination is only reachable through a certain interface. Some devices will
be accessible because the generated hash matches the interface, on which the device is located on, but it might not choose the needed interface as well,
which will result in inaccessible device. Only broadcast bonding mode does not have this kind of protocol limitation, but this bonding mode has a very
limited use case.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Limited connectivity
Unstable links (in case of balance-rr)
```
Solution
Bonding interfaces are not supposed to be connected using in-direct links, but it is still possible to create a workaround. The idea behind this workaround is
to find a way to bypass packets being sent out using the bonding interface. There are multiple ways to force a packet not to be sent out using the bonding
interface, but essentially the solution is to create new interfaces on top of physical interfaces and add these newly created interfaces to a bond instead of
the physical interfaces. One way to achieve this is to create EoIP tunnels on each physical interface, but that creates a huge overhead and will reduce
overall throughput. You should create a VLAN interface on top of each physical interface instead, this creates a much smaller overhead and will not impact
overall performance noticeably. Here is an example of how R1 and R2 should be reconfigured:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=VLAN_ether1 vlan-id=999
add interface=ether2 name=VLAN_ether2 vlan-id=999
/interface bonding
add mode=balance-xor name=bond1 slaves=VLAN_ether1,VLAN_ether2 transmit-hash-policy=layer-2-and-3
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.X/24 interface=bond1
add address=192.168.11.X/24 interface=ether1
add address=192.168.22.X/24 interface=ether2
```
AP1 and ST1 only need updated IP addresses to the correct subnet:
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.11.X/24 interface=bridge1
```
Same changes must be applied to AP2 and ST2 (make sure to use the correct subnet):
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.22.X/24 interface=bridge1
```
With this approach, you create the least overhead and the least configuration changes are required.
Bandwidth testing
Consider the following scenario, you set up a link between two devices, this can be any link, an Ethernet cable, a wireless link, a tunnel or any other
connection. You decide that you want to test the link's bandwidth, but for convenience reasons, you decide to start testing the link with the same devices
that are running the link.
Problem
As soon as you start Bandwidth test or Traffic generator you notice that the throughput is much smaller than expected. For very powerful routers, which
should be able to forward many Gigabits per second (Gbps) you notice that only a few Gigabits per second gets forwarded. The reason why this is
happening is because of the testing method you are using, you should never test throughput on a router while using the same router for generating traffic
because you are adding an additional load on the CPU that reduces the total throughput.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Low throughput;
High CPU usage;
```
Solution
Use a proper testing method. Don't use Bandwidth-test to test large capacity links and don't run any tool that generates traffic on the same device you are
testing. Design your network properly so you can attach devices that will generate and receive traffic on both ends. If you are familiar with Iperf, then this
concept should be clear. Remember that in real-world a router or a switch does not generate large amounts of traffic (at least it shouldn't, otherwise, it
might indicate an existing security issue), a server/client generates the traffic while a router/switch forwards the traffic (and does some manipulations to the
traffic in appropriate cases).
```
LACP (802.3ad) is not mean to be used in setups, where devices bonding slaves are not directly connected, in this case, it is not recommended
to use LACP if there are Wireless links between both routers. LACP requires both bonding slaves to be at the same link speeds, Wireless links
can change their rates at any time, which will decrease overall performance and stability. Other bonding modes should be used instead.
```
Bridge split-horizon usage
Consider the following scenario, you have a bridge and you need to isolate certain bridge ports from each other. There are options to use a built-in switch
chip to isolate certain ports on certain switch chips, you can use bridge firewall rules to prevent certain ports to be able to send any traffic to other ports,
you can isolate ports in a PVLAN type of setup using port isolation, but there is also a software-based solution to use bridge split-horizon (which disables
hardware offloading on all switch chips).
Configuration
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=1 hw=no interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=2 hw=no interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=3 hw=no interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=4 hw=no interface=ether4
```
Problem
After setting the bridge split-horizon on each port, you start to notice that each port is still able to send data between each other. The reason for this is the
misuse of bridge split-horizon. A bridge port is only not able to communicate with ports that are in the same horizon, for example, horizon=1 is not able to
communicate with horizon=1, but is able to communicate with horizon=2, horizon=3, and so on.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
Traffic is being forwarded on different bridge split-horizons
```
Solution
Set a proper value as the bridge split-horizon. In case you want to isolate each port from each other (a common scenario for PPPoE setups) and each port
is only able to communicate with the bridge itself, then all ports must be in the same bridge split-horizon.
```
/interface bridge port
set [f] horizon=1
```
Unsupported SFP modules
Consider the following scenario, you have decided to use optical fiber cables to connect your devices together by using SFP or SFP+ optical modules, but
for convenience reasons, you have decided to use SFP optical modules that were available.
Problem
As soon as you configure your devices to have connectivity on the ports that are using these SFP optical modules, you might notice that either the link is
working properly or experiencing random connectivity issues. There are many vendors that manufacture SFP optical modules, but not all vendors strictly
follow SFP MSA, SFF, and IEEE 802.3 standards, which can lead to unpredictable compatibility issues, which is a very common issue when using not well
known or unsupported SFP optical modules in MikroTik devices.
Symptoms
Below is a list of possible symptoms that might be a result of this kind of misconfiguration:
```
SFP interface does not link up
Random packet drop
Unstable link (flapping)
SFP module not running after a reboot
SFP module not running after power-cycle
SFP module running only on one side
```
Solution
You should only use supported SFP modules. Always check the SFP compatibility table if you are intending to use SFP modules manufactured by
MikroTik. There are other SFP modules that do work with MikroTik devices as well, check the Supported peripherals table to find other SFP modules that
have been confirmed to work with MikroTik devices. Some unsupported modules might not be working properly at certain speeds and with auto-
negotiation, you might want to try to disable it and manually set a link speed.
```
Setting all bridge ports in the same bridge split-horizon will result in traffic being only able to reach the bridge interface itself, then packets can
only be routed. This is useful when you want other devices to filter out certain traffic. Similar behavior can be achieved using bridge filter rules.
```


# Loop Protect
The loop protect feature can prevent Layer2 loops by sending loop protect protocol packets and shutting down interfaces in case they receive loop protect
packets originating from themselves. The feature works by checking the source MAC address of the received loop-protect packet against the MAC
addresses of loop-protect enabled interfaces. If the match is found, loop protect disables the interface that received the loop protect packet. Log message
warns about this event and the interface is marked with a loop protect comment by the system. The RouterOS loop protect feature can be used on bridged
interfaces as well as on Ethernet interfaces which are set for switching in RouterBoard switch chips.
Loop Protect works on Ethernet, VLAN, EoIP, VxLAN interfaces and its packets are encapsulated with EtherType 0x9003.
There the loop protect packet interval and interface disable time can be adjusted. Configuration changes or expiration of disable time, resets loop
protection on an interface.
Sub-menu: /interface ethernet; /interface vlan; /interface eoip; /interface eoipv6; /interface vxlan
```
Property Description
```
```
loop-protect (on | off | default; Default: default) Enables or disables loop protect on the selected interface. default works as turned off.
```
```
loop-protect-send-interval (time interval; Default: 5s) Sets how often loop protect packets are sent on the selected interface.
```
```
loop-protect-disable-time (time interval | 0; Default: 5m) Sets how long the selected interface is disabled when a loop is detected.  0  - forever.
```
Read-only properties
```
Property Description
```
```
loop-protect-status (on | off |
disable) on^ - loop-protect feature is turned on, the interface is sending and listening for loop protect packets
off - loop-protect feature is turned off
disable - loop-protect feature is turned on, the interface has received loop protect packet and disabled itself
to prevent loop.
```
```
Even though loop-protect can work on interfaces that are added to a bridge, it is still recommended to use (R/M)STP rather than loop-protect
since (R/M)STP is compatible with most switches STP variants provide many more configuration options to fine-tune your network.
```


# QoS with Switch Chip

## Introduction
Queues in RouterOS are processed using CPU resources, so limiting traffic with queues on devices with relatively weak CPUs is not an effective
configuration. In other words, switch-based units will be overloaded very fast, because they are meant to process layer 2 traffic by using a switch-chip, not
CPU. To avoid such inefficiency, RouterOS allows limiting traffic using switch chips.

## CRS3xx, CRS5xx series, and CCR2116, CCR2216 devices
For CRS3xx series switches, it is possible to limit ingress traffic that matches certain parameters with ACL rules and it is possible to limit ingress/egress
traffic per port basis. The policer is used for ingress traffic, the shaper is used for egress traffic. The ingress policer controls the received traffic with packet
drops. Everything that exceeds the defined limit will get dropped. This can affect the TCP congestion control mechanism on end hosts and the achieved
bandwidth can be actually less than defined. The egress shaper tries to queue packets that exceed the limit instead of dropping them. Eventually, it will
also drop packets when the output queue gets full, however, it should allow utilizing the defined throughput better.
Port-based traffic police (ingress) and shaper (egress):
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1 ingress-rate=10M egress-rate=5M
```
MAC-based traffic policer:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 src-mac-address=64:D1:54:D9:27:E6/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF rate=10M
```
VLAN-based traffic policer:
```
/interface bridge
set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 vlan-id=11 rate=10M
```
Protocol-based traffic policer:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add ports=ether1 switch=switch1 mac-protocol=ipx rate=10M
```

## CRS1xx/CRS2xxSeries devices

## Configuration schemes
MAC based traffic scheduling and shaping: [MAC address in UFDB] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
VLAN based traffic scheduling and shaping: [VLAN id in VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
Protocol based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Protocol in Protocol VLAN table] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
```
This paragraph applies to CCR2116, CCR2216 devices, and CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches. It doesn't apply to CRS1xx/CRS2xx series
switches.
```
```
This subsection does not apply to CRS3xx series devices!
```
PCP/DEI based traffic scheduling and shaping: [Switch port PCP/DEI mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
DSCP based traffic scheduling and shaping: [QoS DSCP mapping] -> [Priority] -> [Queue] -> [Shaper]
MAC based traffic scheduling using internal Priority
In Strict Priority scheduling mode, the highest priority queue is served first. The queue number represents the priority and the queue with the highest queue
number has the highest priority. Traffic is transmitted from the highest priority queue until the queue is empty, and then moves to the next highest priority
queue, and so on. If no congestion is present on the egress port, the packet is transmitted as soon as it is received. If congestion occurs at the port where
high-priority traffic keeps coming, the lower-priority queues starve.
On all CRS switches the scheme where MAC-based egress traffic scheduling is done according to internal Priority would be the following: [MAC address] -
> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] -> [Queue];
In this example, host1 (E7:16:34:00:00:01) and host2 (E7:16:34:00:00:02) will have higher priority 1 and the rest of the hosts will have lower priority 0 for
transmitted traffic on port ether7. Note that CRS has a maximum of 8 queues per port.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1
```
Add UFDB entries to match specific MACs on ether7 and apply QoS group1:
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:01 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
add mac-address=E7:16:34:00:00:02 port=ether7 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
```
Configure ether7 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
prior\
ity:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 \
qos-scheme-precedence=da-based
```
MAC based traffic shaping using internal Priority
The scheme where MAC based traffic shaping is done according to internal Priority would be following: [MAC address] -> [QoS Group] -> [Priority] ->
[Queue] -> [Shaper];
In this example, unlimited traffic will have priority 0 and limited traffic will have priority 1 with a bandwidth limit of 10Mbit. Note that CRS has a maximum of
8 queues per port.
Create a group of ports for switching:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create a QoS group for use in UFDB:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group1 priority=1
```
Add UFDB entry to match specific MAC on ether8 and apply QoS group1:
```
/interface ethernet switch unicast-fdb
add mac-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 port=ether8 qos-group=group1 svl=yes
```
Configure ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for destination address:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
prior\
ity:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1 \
qos-scheme-precedence=da-based
```
Apply bandwidth limit for queue1 on ether8:
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether8 rate=10M target=queue1
```
If the CRS switch supports Access Control List, this configuration is simpler:
```
/interface ethernet switch acl policer
add name=policer1 yellow-burst=100k yellow-rate=10M
```
```
/interface ethernet switch acl
add mac-dst-address=E7:16:34:A1:CD:18 policer=policer1
```
VLAN-based traffic scheduling + shaping using internal Priorities
A best practice is to assign lower internal QoS Priority for traffic limited by shaper to make it also less important in the Strict Priority scheduler. (higher
priority should be more important and unlimited)
In this example:
Switch port ether6 is using a shaper to limit the traffic that comes from ether7 and ether8.
When a link has reached its capacity, the traffic with the highest priority will be sent out first.
VLAN10 -> QoS group0 = lowest priority
VLAN20 -> QoS group1 = normal priority
VLAN30 -> QoS group2 = highest priority
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8 hw=yes
```
Create QoS groups for use in the VLAN table:
```
/interface ethernet switch qos-group
add name=group0 priority=0
add name=group1 priority=1
add name=group2 priority=2
```
Add VLAN entries to apply QoS groups for certain VLANs:
```
/interface ethernet switch vlan
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group0 vlan-id=10
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group1 vlan-id=20
add ports=ether6,ether7,ether8 qos-group=group2 vlan-id=30
```
Configure ether6, ether7, ether8 port queues to work according to Strict Priority and QoS scheme only for VLAN-based QoS:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether6 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
prior\
ity:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 \
qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based
set ether7 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
prior\
ity:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 \
qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based
set ether8 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
prior\
ity:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0" priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2 \
qos-scheme-precedence=vlan-based
```
Apply bandwidth limit on ether6:
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether6 rate=10M
```
PCP based traffic scheduling
By default, CRS1xx/CRS2xx series devices will ignore the PCP/CoS/802.1p value and forward packets based on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) manner. When
the device's internal queue is not full, then packets are in a FIFO manner, but as soon as a queue is filled, then higher-priority traffic will be sent out first.
Let's consider a scenario when ether1 and ether2 are forwarding data to ether3, but when ether3 is congested, then packets are going to be scheduled, we
can configure the switch to hold lowest priority packets until all higher priority packets are sent out, this is a very common scenario for VoIP type setups,
where some traffic needs to be prioritized.
To achieve such a behavior, switch together ether1, ether2, and ether3 ports:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 hw=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3 hw=yes
```
Enable Strict Policy for each internal queue on each port:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 per-queue-scheduling="strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-
priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0,strict-priority:0"
```
Map each PCP value to an internal priority value, for convenience reasons simply map PCP to an internal priority 1-to-1:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 pcp-based-qos-priority-mapping=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7
```
Since the switch will empty the largest queue first and you need the highest priority to be served first, then you can assign this internal priority to a queue 1-
to-1:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 priority-to-queue=0:0,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:4,5:5,6:6,7:7
```
Finally, set each switch port to schedule packets based on the PCP value:
```
/interface ethernet switch port
set ether1,ether2,ether3 qos-scheme-precedence=pcp-based
```
Bandwidth Limiting
Both Ingress Port policer and Shaper provide bandwidth limiting features for CRS switches:
Ingress Port Policer sets RX limit on port:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M
```
Shaper sets TX limit on port:
```
/interface ethernet switch shaper
add port=ether5 meter-unit=bit rate=10M
```
Traffic Storm Control
The same Ingress Port policer also can be used for traffic storm control to prevent disruptions on Layer 2 ports caused by broadcast, multicast, or unicast
traffic storms.
Broadcast storm control example on ether5 port with 500 packet limit per second:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=500 meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast
```
Example with multiple packet types that include ARP and ND protocols and unregistered multicast traffic. Unregistered multicast is the traffic which is not
defined in the Multicast Forwarding database:
```
/interface ethernet switch ingress-port-policer
add port=ether5 rate=5k meter-unit=packet packet-types=broadcast,arp-or-nd,unregistered-multicast
```

## Summary
The purpose of the spanning tree protocol is to provide the ability to create loop-free Layer 2 topologies while having redundant links. While connecting
multiple bridges or just cross-connecting bridge ports, it's possible to create network loops that can severely impact the stability of the network. Spanning
tree protocol aims to resolve this problem by introducing the concept of the root bridge, all bridges in the same Layer 2 domain will exchange information
about the shortest path to the root bridge. Afterward, each bridge will negotiate which ports to use to reach the root bridge. This information exchange is
done with the help of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). STP will disable certain ports for each bridge to avoid loops, while still ensuring that all bridges
can communicate with each other. For an in-depth description of protocol please refer to IEEE 802.1D.
As a best practice, it is always recommended to manually set up each bridge's priority, port priority, and port path cost to ensure proper Layer2 functionality
at all times. Leaving STP related values to defaults is acceptable for a network that consists of 1 to 2 bridges running with (R/M)STP enabled, but it is
highly recommended to manually set these values for larger networks. Since STP elects a root bridge and root ports by checking STP related values from
bridges over the network, then leaving STP settings to automatic may elect an undesired root bridge and root ports and in case of a hardware failure can
result in an inaccessible network.

## Monitoring
You can check the STP status of a bridge by using the /interface bridge monitor  command, for example:
```
/interface bridge monitor bridge1
state: enabled
current-mac-address: B8:69:F4:30:19:FE
root-bridge: no
root-bridge-id: 0x1000.B8:69:F4:30:19:FD
root-path-cost: 4000
root-port: sfp-sfpplus2
port-count: 2
designated-port-count: 1
fast-forward: yes
```
Note that the root bridge doesn't have any root ports, only designated ports.
You can check the STP status of a bridge port by using the /interface bridge port monitor command, for example:
```
RouterOS bridge does not work with PVST and its variants. The PVST BPDUs (with a MAC destination 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CD) are treated by
RouterOS bridges as typical multicast packets. In simpler terms, they undergo RouterOS bridge/switch forwarding logic and may get tagged or
untagged.
```
```
/interface bridge port monitor [find interface=sfp-sfpplus2]
interface: sfp-sfpplus2
status: in-bridge
port-number: 1
role: root-port
edge-port: no
edge-port-discovery: yes
point-to-point-port: yes
external-fdb: no
sending-rstp: yes
learning: yes
forwarding: yes
path-cost: 2000
root-path-cost: 4000
designated-bridge: 0x8000.DC:2C:6E:9E:11:1C
designated-cost: 2000
designated-port-number: 2
```
Note that root-bridge-id consists of the bridge priority and the bridge's MAC address, for non-root bridges the root bridge will be shown as designate
d-bridge.
STP and RSTP
STP and Rapid STP are used widely across many networks, but almost all networks have switched over to using only RSTP because of its benefits. STP
is a very old protocol and has a convergence time (the time needed to fully learn network topology changes and to continue properly forwarding traffic) of
up to 50 seconds. RSTP has a lot of smaller convergence time, a few seconds or even a few milliseconds. It is recommended to use RSTP instead of STP
since it is a lot faster and is also backward compatible with STP. One of the reasons why RSTP is faster is because of reduced possible port states, below
is a list of possible STP port states:
```
Forwarding - port participates in traffic forwarding and is learning MAC addresses, and is receiving BPDUs.
Listening - port does not participate in traffic forwarding and is not learning MAC addresses, is receiving BPDUs.
Learning - port does not participate in traffic forwarding but is learning MAC addresses.
Blocking - port is blocked since it is causing loops but is receiving BPDUs.
Disabled - port is disabled or inactive.
```
In RSTP the disabled, listening, and blocking port states are replaced with just one state called the Discarding state:
```
Forwarding - port participates in traffic forwarding and is learning MAC addresses, is receiving BPDUs (forwarding=yes).
Learning - port does not participate in traffic forwarding but is learning MAC addresses (learning=yes).
Discarding - port does not participate in traffic forwarding and is not learning MAC addresses, is receiving BPDUs (forwarding=no).
```
In STP ports are primarily categorized by states (e.g., Forwarding, Listening, Learning, Blocking, Disabled). Port behavior is determined dynamically based
on the spanning tree algorithm but without explicitly assigning roles. The logic of forwarding or blocking traffic is derived from the calculation of Root
Bridge, Root Ports, and Designated Ports, but these are considered part of the spanning tree topology rather than formalized port roles. RSTP explicitly
defined port roles and introduces the concept of backup paths, which are explicitly represented through the Alternate Port and Backup Port roles. These
roles did not exist in STP because STP treated blocked ports generically, without distinguishing their function as potential backups.
Here is a breakdown of the port roles for RSTP protocols:
```
Root Port - port that is facing towards the root bridge and has the best (lowest cost) path to the root bridge. Only one root port is elected per
bridge (except the root bridge itself).
Designated Port - port that is facing away from the root bridge and forwards traffic away from the root bridge to downstream devices.
Alternate Port - port that is facing towards the root bridge, but is not going to forward traffic. Port provides a backup path to the root bridge if the
current root port fails.
Backup Port - port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is going to forward traffic. Port that serves as a backup for a designated port on the
same segment.
Disabled Port - disabled or inactive port.
```
```
When using bridges that are set to use 802.1Q as EtherType, they will send out BPDUs to 01:80:C2:00:00:00, which are used by MSTP, RSTP,
and STP. When using 802.1ad as bridge VLAN protocol, the BPDUs are not compatible with 802.1Q bridges and they are sent to 01:80:C2:00:
00:08. (R/M)STP will not function properly if there are different bridge VLAN protocols across the Layer2 network.
```
In STP connectivity between bridges is determined by sending and receiving BPDUs between neighbor bridges. Designated ports are sending BPDUs to
root ports. If a BPDU is not received 3 times the HelloTime in a row, then the connection is considered as unavailable and network topology convergence
will commence. IT is possible to reduce STP convergence time in certain scenarios by reducing the forward-delay timer, which is responsible for how
long can the port be in the learning/listening state.
In RouterOS, it is possible to specify which bridge ports are edge ports. Edge ports are ports that are not supposed to receive any BPDUs, this is beneficial
since this allows STP to skip the learning and the listening state and directly go to the forwarding state. This feature is sometimes called PortFast· You can
leave this parameter to the default value, which is auto, but you can also manually specify it, you can set a port as an edge port manually for ports that
should not have any more bridges behind it, usually these are access ports.
Additionally, bridge port point-to-point , specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of
failure. By setting this property to yes, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and waits
for BPDUs from other devices from this single link, by setting this property to no, you are implying that a link can receive BPDUs from multiple devices. By
setting the property to yes, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In general, you should only set this property to no , if it is possible
that another device can be connected between a link, this is mostly relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex, auto
enables point-to-point functionality. This property has no effect when protocol-mode is set to none.
Default values
When creating a bridge or adding a port to the bridge the following are the default values that are assigned by RouterOS:
```
Default bridge priority:  32768  / 0x8000
Default bridge port path cost: based on interface speed
Default bridge port priority: 0x80
BPDU message age increment:  1
HelloTime:  2
Default max message age:  20
```
The bridge interface setting port-cost-mode changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic
values based on interface speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configured path-cost  or internal-path-cost properties.
Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate calculations for intermediate rates):
```
Data rate Long Short
```
```
10 Mbps 2,000,000 100
```
```
100 Mbps 200,000 19
```
```
1 Gbps 20,000 4
```
```
10 Gbps 2,000 2
```
```
25 Gbps 800 1
```
```
40 Gbps 500 1
```
```
50 Gbps  400 1
```
```
100 Gbps 200 1
```
For bonded interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied, this value remains unaffected by the total link speed of the
bonding. For virtual interfaces (such as VLAN, EoIP, VXLAN), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000 is assigned for long
mode, and 10 for short mode. For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10
for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to bridge, for instance, by using the CAPsMAN d
atapath.bridge-cost setting. RouterOS versions prior to 7.13 does not change port path cost based on the link speed, for 10M, 100M, 1000M, and
10000M link speeds the default path cost value when a port is added to a bridge was always  10.
The age of a BPDU is determined by how many bridges have the BPDU passed times the message age since RouterOS uses  1  as the message age
increment, then the BPDU packet can pass as many bridges as specified in the max-message-age parameter. By default this value is set to  20 , this
means that after the 20th bridge the BPDU packet will be discarded and the next bridge will become a root bridge, note that if max-message-age=20 is
set, then it is hard to predict which ports will be the designated port on the 21st bridge and may result in traffic not being able to be forwarded properly.
```
In case bridge filter rules are used, make sure you allow packets with DST-MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:00 since these packets carry BPDUs
that are crucial for STP to work properly.

Election process
To properly configure STP in your network you need to understand the election process and which parameters are involved in which order. In RouterOS,
the root bridge will be elected based on the smallest priority and the smallest MAC address in this particular order:
```
Bridge priority (lowest)
Bridge MAC address (lowest)
```
In RouterOS root ports are elected based on the lowest Root port path cost, lowest bridge identifier, and lowest bridge port ID in this particular order:
```
Root port path cost (lowest)
Bridge identifier (lowest)
Bridge port ID (lowest)
```
First, when the device considers which of its ports to elect as the root port, it will check the root path cost seen by its ports. If the root path cost is the same
for two or more ports then the Bridge identifier of the upstream device will be checked and the port connected to the lowest bridge identifier will become the
root port. If the same bridge identifier is seen on two or more ports, then the Bridge port ID of the upstream device will be checked.
Explanation of attributes:
Root path cost, all bridges have a Root Path Cost. The root bridge has a root path cost of 0. For all other Bridges, it is the sum of the Port Path Costs on
the least-cost path to the Root Bridge. You can modify the local port path cost under "/interface bridge port".
The bridge identifier is a combination of "bridge priority" and "bridge MAC", configurable under "/interface bridge"
Bridge port ID is a combination of "unique ID" and "bridge port priority", the unique ID is automatically assigned to the bridge port upon adding it to the
bridge, it cannot be edited. It can be seen in WinBox under the "Bridge Port" "Port Number" column, or with "/interface bridge port monitor", as "
port-number".
Examples
Root path cost example
```
Make sure you are using path cost and priority on the right ports. For example, setting path cost on ports that are in a root bridge has no effect,
only port priority affects them. Root path cost affects ports that are facing towards the root bridge and port priority affects ports that are facing
away from the root bridge. And bridge identifier doesn’t impact the device's own root port election, instead, it affects the root port election for
downstream devices.
```
```
In RouterOS it is possible to set any value for bridge priority between 0 and 65535, the IEEE 802.1W standard states that the bridge priority
must be in steps of 4096. This can cause incompatibility issues between devices that do not support such values. To avoid incompatibility
issues, it is recommended to use only these priorities: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672, 32768, 36864, 40960, 45056,
49152, 53248, 57344, 61440.
```
This example outlines how the root path cost works. SW1 will be the root bridge, due to it having the lowest priority of 0x1000, as the root bridge. Each
bridge will calculate the path cost to the root bridge. When calculating root path cost bridges take into account the configured path cost on their ports + root
path cost advertised by neighboring bridges.
SW1: due to it being the root bridge, it advertises a root path cost of 0 to its neighbors, even though it has a configured path cost of 10.
SW2:  ether1. has a root path cost of 0 + 25= 25. On the ether2 path cost will be 10+10+10+0= 30
SW3:  ether2, has a root path cost of 0 + 10= 10. On the ether4 path cost will be 10+5+25+0= 40
SW4:  ether1, has a root path cost of 0+25+5= 30. On ether4 path cost will be 10+10+0= 20
The Port with the lowest path cost will be elected as the root port. Every bridge in STP topology needs a path to the root bridge, after the best path has
been found, the redundant path will be blocked, in this case, the path between SW2 and SW4.
STP example
```
You can configure path cost on the root bridge, but it will only be taken into account when the bridge loses its root status.
```
In this example, we want to ensure Layer2 redundancy for connections from ServerA to ServerB. If a port is connected to a device that is not a bridge and
not running (R)STP, then this port is considered as an edge port, in this case, ServerA and ServerB are connected to an edge port. This is possible by
using STP in a network. Below are configuration examples for each switch.
```
Configuration for SW1:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge priority=0x1000
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 priority=0x60
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 priority=0x50
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3 priority=0x40
add bridge=bridge interface=ether4 priority=0x30
add bridge=bridge interface=ether5
```
```
Configuration for SW2:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge priority=0x2000
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```
```
Configuration for SW3:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge priority=0x3000
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```
```
Configuration for SW4:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge priority=0x4000
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 path-cost=20
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```
In this example, SW1 is the root bridge since it has the lowest bridge priority. SW2 and SW3 have ether1,ether2 connected to the root bridge, and ether3 is
connected to SW4. When all switches are working properly, the traffic will be flowing from ServerA through SW1_ether2, through SW2, and through SW4
to ServerB. In the case of SW1 failure, the SW2 becomes the root bridge because of the next lowest priority, indicated by the dotted line in the diagram.
Below is a list of ports and their role for each switch:
```
root-port - SW2_ether2, SW3_ether2, SW4_ether1
alternate-port - SW2_ether1, SW3_ether1, SW4_ether2
designated-port - SW1_ether1, SW1_ether2, SW1_ether3, SW1_ether4, SW1_ether5, SW2_ether3, SW2_ether3, SW4_ether3
```
Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol
Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) is used on a bridge interface to ensure loop-free topology across multiple VLANs, MSTP can also provide Layer2
redundancy and can be used as a load balancing technique for VLANs since it has the ability to have different paths across different VLANs. MSTP is
operating very similarly to (R)STP and many concepts from (R)STP can be applied to MSTP and it is highly recommended to understand the principles
behind (R)STP before using MSTP, but there are some differences that must be taken into account when designing an MSTP enabled network.
In case (R)STP is used, the BPDUs are sent across all physical interfaces in a bridge to determine loops and stop ports from being able to forward traffic if
it causes a loop. In case there is a loop inside a certain VLAN, (R)STP might not be able to detect it. Some STP variants solve this problem by running an
STP instance on every single VLAN (PVST), but this has been proven to be inefficient and some STP variants solve this problem by running a single STP
instance across all VLANs (CST), but it lacks the possibility to do load balancing for each VLAN or VLAN group. MSTP tends to solve both problems by
using MST instances that can define a group of VLANs (VLAN mapping) that can be used for load balancing and redundancy, this means that each VLAN
group can have a different root bridge and a different path. Note that it is beneficial to group multiple VLANs in a single instance to reduce the amount of
CPU cycles for each network topology change.
MSTP Regions
MSTP works in groups called regions, for each region there will be a regional root bridge, and between regions, there will be a root bridge elected. MSTP
will use an Internal Spanning Tree (IST) to build the network topology inside a region and a Common Spanning Tree (CST) outside a region to build the
network topology between multiple regions, MSTP combines these two protocols into Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST), which holds
information about topology inside a region and between regions. From CST's perspective, a region will seemingly be as a single virtual bridge, because of
this MSTP is considered very scalable for large networks. For bridges to be in the same region, their configuration must match, BPDUs will not include
VLAN mappings since they can be large, rather a computed hash is being transmitted. If a bridge receives a BPDU through a port and the configuration
does not match, then MSTP will consider that port as a boundary port and that it can be used to reach other regions. Below is a list of parameters that
need to match for MSTP to consider a BPDU from the same region:
```
Region name
Region revision
VLAN mappings to MST Instance IDs (computed hash)
```
```
Note: By the 802.1Q recommendations, you should use bridge priorities in steps of 4096. To set a recommended priority it is more convenient to
use hexadecimal notation, for example, 0 is 0x0000, 4096 is 0x1000, 8192 is 0x2000, and so on (0..F).
```
```
In RouterOS with MSTP enabled the bridge priority is the CIST's root bridge priority, as stated in the IEEE 802.1Q standard the bridge priority
must be in steps of 4096, the 12 lowest bits are ignored. These are valid bridge priorities: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480, 24576, 28672,
32768, 36864, 40960, 45056, 49152, 53248, 57344, 61440. When setting an invalid bridge priority, RouterOS will warn you about it and trunk
the value to a valid value, but will save the original value in the configuration since invalid bridge priority values can still be used in (R)STP
between devices running RouterOS, though it is recommended to use valid a bridge priority instead.
```
It is possible to create MSTP enabled network without regions, though to be able to do load balancing per VLAN group it is required for a bridge to receive
a BPDU from a bridge that is connected to it with the same parameters mentioned above. In RouterOS the default region name is empty and the region
revision is 0, which are valid values, but you must make sure that they match to get multiple bridges in a single MSTP region. A region cannot exist if its
bridges are scattered over the network, these bridges must be connected at least in one way, in which they can send and receive BPDUs without leaving
the region, for example, if a bridge with different region related parameters is between two bridges that have the same region related parameters, then
there will exist at least 3 different MSTP regions.
The downside of running every single bridge in a single MSTP region is the excess CPU cycles. In comparison, PVST(+) creates a Spanning Tree
Instance for each VLAN ID that exists on the network, since there will be very limited paths that can exist in a network, then this approach creates a lot of
overhead and unnecessary CPU cycles, this also means that this approach does not scale very well and can overload switches with not very powerful
CPUs. MSTP solves this problem by dividing the network into MSTP regions, where each bridge inside this region will exchange and process information
about VLANs that exist inside the same region, but will run a single instance of Spanning Tree Protocol in the background to maintain the network topology
between regions. This approach has been proven to be much more effective and much more scalable, this means that regions should be used for larger
networks to reduce CPU cycles.
In regions, you can define MST Instances, which are used to configure load balancing per VLAN group and to elect the regional root bridge. It is worth
mentioning that in each region there exists a pre-defined MST Instance, in most documentations, this is called as MSTI0· This MST Instance is considered
as the default MST Instance, there are certain parameters that apply to this special MST Instance. When traffic passes through an MSTP enabled bridge,
MSTP will look for an MST Instance that has a matching VLAN mapping, but if a VLAN mapping does not exist for a certain VLAN ID, then traffic will fall
under MSTI0.
Election process
The election process in MSTP can be divided into two sections, intra-region and inter-region. For MSTP to work properly there will always need to be a
regional root, that is the root bridge inside a region, and a CIST root, that is the root bridge between regions. A regional root is the root bridge inside a
region, regional root bridge will be needed to properly set up load balancing for VLAN groups inside a region. CIST root will be used to configure which
ports will be alternate/backup ports (inactive) and which ports will be root ports (active).
```
The following parameters are involved in electing a regional root bridge or root ports inside a MSTP region:
```
```
Property Description
```
```
priority (integer: 0..65535 decimal format or 0x0000-0xffff
hex format; Default: 32768 / 0x8000)
```
```
/interface bridge msti, MST Instance priority, used to elect a regional root inside an
MSTP region.
```
```
internal-path-cost (integer: 1..200000000; Default: ) /interface bridge port, path cost to the regional root for unknown VLAN IDs (MSTI0),
used on a root port inside an MSTP region.
```
```
priority (integer: 0..240; Default:  128 ) /interface bridge port mst-override, MST port priority for a defined MST Instance, used
on a bridge port on the regional root bridge.
```
```
internal-path-cost (integer: 1..200000000; Default: ) /interface bridge port mst-override, MST port path cost for a defined MST Instance,
used on a non-root bridge port inside an MSTP region.
```
```
Since MSTP requires VLAN filtering on the bridge interface to be enabled, then make sure that you have allowed all required VLAN IDs in /inte
rface bridge vlan, otherwise, the traffic will not be forwarded and it might seem as if MSTP is misconfigured, although this is a VLAN
filtering misconfiguration.
```
```
Between regions, there is no load balancing per VLAN group, root port election process, and port blocking between MSTP regions is done the
same way as in (R)STP. If CIST has blocked a port that is inside an MSTP region to prevent traffic loops between MSTP regions, then this port
can still be active for IST to do load balancing per VLAN group inside an MSTP region.
```
```
The following parameters are involved in electing a CIST root bridge or CIST root ports:
```
```
Property Description
```
```
priority (integer: 0..65535 decimal format or 0x0000-0xffff hex format;
Default: 32768 / 0x8000)
```
```
/interface bridge, CIST bridge priority, used to elect a CIST root bridge.
```
```
priority (integer: 0..240; Default:  128 ) /interface bridge port, CIST port priority, used on a CIST root bridge to elect
CIST root ports.
```
```
path-cost (integer: 1..200000000; Default: ) /interface bridge port, CIST port path cost, used on a CIST non-root bridge
port to elect CIST root ports.
```
MST Instance
Sub-menu: /interface bridge msti
This section is used to group multiple VLAN IDs into a single instance to create a different root bridge for each VLAN group inside an MSTP region.
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (text; Default: ) Bridge to which assigns an MST instance.
```
```
identifier (integer: 1..31; Default: ) MST instance identifier.
```

Monitoring
Similarly to (R)STP, it is also possible to monitor MSTP status. By monitoring the bridge interface itself it is possible to see the current CIST root bridge and
the current regional root bridge for MSTI0, it is also possible to see the computed hash of MST Instance identifiers and VLAN mappings, this is useful
when making sure that certain bridges are in the same MSTP region. Below you can find an example of monitoring an MSTP bridge:
```
The sequence of parameters in which MSTP checks to elect root bridge/ports is the same as in (R)STP, you can read more about it in the (R)
STP Election Process section.
```
```
/interface bridge monitor bridge
state: enabled
current-mac-address: 6C:3B:6B:7B:F0:AA
root-bridge: no
root-bridge-id: 0x1000.64:D1:54:24:23:72
regional-root-bridge-id: 0x4000.6C:3B:6B:7B:F0:AA

root-port: ether4
port-count: 5
designated-port-count: 3
mst-config-digest: 74edbeefdbf82cf63a70cf60e43a56f3
```
In MSTP it is possible to monitor the MST Instance, this is useful to determine the current regional root bridge for a certain MST Instance and VLAN group,
below you can find an example to monitor an MST Instance:
```
/interface bridge msti monitor 1
state: enabled
identifier: 2
current-mac-address: 6C:3B:6B:7B:F0:AA
root-bridge: no
root-bridge-id: 0.00:00:00:00:00:00
regional-root-bridge-id: 0x1002.6C:3B:6B:7B:F9:08
root-path-cost: 0
root-port: ether2
port-count: 5
designated-port-count: 1
```
It is also possible to monitor a certain MST Override entry, this is useful to determine the port role for a certain MST Instance when configuring root ports
and alternate/backup ports in an MSTP region, below you can find an example to monitor an MST Override entry:
```
/interface bridge port mst-override monitor 1
port: ether3
status: active
identifier: 2
role: alternate-port
learning: no
forwarding: no
internal-root-path-cost: 15
designated-bridge: 0x1002.6C:3B:6B:7B:F9:08
designated-internal-cost: 0
designated-port-number: 130
```
MSTP example
Let's say that we need to design topology and configure MSTP in a way that VLAN 10,20 will be forwarded in one path, but VLAN 30,40 will be forwarded
in a different path, while all other VLAN IDs will be forwarded in one of those paths. This can easily be done by setting up MST Instances and assigning
port path costs, below you can find a network topology that needs to do load balancing per VLAN group with 3 separate regions as an example:
The topology of an MSTP-enabled network with load balancing per VLAN group
Start by adding each interface to a bridge, initially, you should create a (R)STP bridge without VLAN filtering enabled, this is to prevent losing access to the
CPU. Each device in this example is named by the region that it is in (Rx) and a device number (_x). For larger networks configuring MSTP can be
confusing because of the number of links and devices, we recommend using The Dude to monitor and design a network topology.
```
Use the following commands on R1_1, R1_3, R2_1, R2_3, R3_1, R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge protocol-mode=rstp vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge interface=ether4
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_2, R2_2, R3_2:
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge protocol-mode=rstp vlan-filtering=no
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2
```
```
Make sure you allow the required VLAN IDs on these devices, here we will consider that each device will receive tagged traffic that needs to be
load balanced per VLAN group, use these commands on R1_1, R1_3, R2_1, R2_3, R3_1, R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4 vlan-ids=10,20,30,40
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_2, R2_2, R3_2:
```
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2 vlan-ids=10,20,30,40
```
```
Make sure you add all the needed VLAN IDs and ports to the bridge VLAN table, otherwise, your device will not forward all required VLANs, and
/or you will lose access to the device.
```
We need to assign a region name for each bridge that we want to be in a single MSTP region, you can also specify the region revision, but it is optional,
though they need to match. In this example, if all bridges will have the same region name, then they will all be in a single MSTP bridge. In this case, we
want to separate a group of 3 bridges in a different MSTP region to do load balancing per VLAN group and to create diversity and scalability.
```
Set the appropriate region name (and region revision) for each bridge, and use the following commands on each device (change the region name!):
```
```
/interface bridge
set bridge region-name=Rx region-revision=1
```
After we have created 3 different MSTP regions, we need to decide which device is going to be a regional root for each VLAN group. For consistency, we
are going to set the first device (_1) in each region as the regional root for VLAN 10,20 and the third device (_3) in each region as the regional root for
VLAN 30,40. This can be done by creating an MST Instance for each VLAN group and assigning a bridge priority to it. The MST Instance identifier is only
relevant inside an MSTP region, outside an MSTP region these identifiers can be different and mapped to a different VLAN group.
```
Use the following commands on R1_1, R2_1, R3_1:
```
```
/interface bridge msti
add bridge=bridge identifier=1 priority=0x1000 vlan-mapping=10,20
add bridge=bridge identifier=2 priority=0x3000 vlan-mapping=30,40
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_3, R2_3, R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge msti
add bridge=bridge identifier=1 priority=0x3000 vlan-mapping=10,20
add bridge=bridge identifier=2 priority=0x1000 vlan-mapping=30,40
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_2, R2_2, R3_2:
```
```
/interface bridge msti
add bridge=bridge identifier=1 priority=0x2000 vlan-mapping=10,20
add bridge=bridge identifier=2 priority=0x2000 vlan-mapping=30,40
```
Now we need to override the port path-cost and/or port priority for each MST Instance. This can be done by adding an MST-Override entry for each
port and each MST Instance. To achieve that for a certain MST Instance the traffic flow path is different, we simply need to make sure that the port path
cost and/or priority is larger. We can either increase the port path cost or decrease the port path cost to ports that are facing toward the regional root
bridge. It doesn't matter if you increase or decrease all values, it is important that in the end, one port's path cost is larger than the other's.
```
Use the following commands on R1_1, R2_1, R3_1:
```
```
/interface bridge port mst-override
add identifier=2 interface=ether1 internal-path-cost=5
add identifier=2 interface=ether2 internal-path-cost=15
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_2, R2_2, R3_2:
```
```
/interface bridge port mst-override
add identifier=1 interface=ether1 internal-path-cost=5
add identifier=2 interface=ether2 internal-path-cost=9
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_3, R2_3, R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge port mst-override
add identifier=1 interface=ether2 internal-path-cost=5
add identifier=1 interface=ether3 internal-path-cost=9
```
In this case for VLAN 10,20 to reach the third device from the first device, it would choose between ether1 and ether2, one port will be blocked and set as
an alternate port, and ether1 will have path cost as 5+9=14 and ether2 will have path cost as  10 , ether2 will be elected as the root port for MSTI1 on the
third device. In case for VLAN 30,40 to reach the first device from the third device, ether1 will have path cost as 5+9=14 and ether2 will have path cost as  15
, ether1 will be elected as the root port for MSTI2 on the third device.
Now we can configure the root ports for MSTI0, which will fall under all VLANs that are not assigned to a specific MST Instance, like in our example VLAN
10,20, and VLAN 30,40. To configure this special MST Instance, you will need to specify internal-path-cost to a bridge port. This value is only
relevant to MSTP regions, it does not have any effect outside an MSTP region. In this example will choose that all unknown VLANs will be forwarded over
the same path as VLAN 30,40, we will simply increase the path cost on one of the ports.
```
Use the following commands on R1_3, R2_3, R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether3] internal-path-cost=25
```
At this point, a single region MSTP can be considered as configured, and in general, MSTP is fully functional. It is highly recommended to configure the
CIST part, but for testing purposes, it can be left with the default values. Before doing any tests, you need to enable MSTP on all bridges.
```
Use the following commands on all devices:
```
```
/interface bridge
set bridge protocol-mode=mstp vlan-filtering=yes
```
When MSTP regions have been configured, you can check if they are properly configured by forwarding traffic, for example, send tagged traffic from the
first device to the third device and change the VLAN ID for the tagged traffic to observe different paths based on VLAN ID. When this is working as
expected, then you can continue to configure CIST related parameters to elect a CIST root bridge and CIST root ports. For consistency we will choose the
first device in the first region to be the CIST root bridge and to ensure consistency in case of failure we can set a higher priority to all other bridges.
```
Use the following commands on R1_1:
```
```
/interface bridge
set bridge priority=0x1000
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_2:
```
```
/interface bridge
set bridge priority=0x2000
```

### ...
```
Use the following commands on R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge
set bridge priority=0x9000
```
We also need to elect a root port on each bridge, for simplicity we will choose the port that is closest to Ŗ1_1 as the root port and has the least hops. At this
point, the procedure to elect root ports is the same as the procedure in (R)STP.
```
Use the following commands on R3_3:
```
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether2] path-cost=30
set [find where interface=ether3] path-cost=40
set [find where interface=ether4] path-cost=20
```
```
Use the following commands on R1_3 and R2_3:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether2] path-cost=20
set [find where interface=ether3] path-cost=30
```
Use the following commands on R1_2:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether1] path-cost=30


# Wireless VLAN Trunk

## Summary
A very common task is to forward only a certain set of VLANs over a Wireless Point-to-Point (PtP) link. This can be done using bridge VLAN filtering and
should be used instead of any other methods (including bridging VLAN interfaces). Let's say we need to forward over a Wireless link to 2 different VLANs
and all other VLAN IDs should be dropped. VLAN 10 is going to be our Internet traffic while VLAN 99 is going to be for our management traffic. Below you
can find the network topology:

## Configuration
Start by creating a new bridge on AP and ST and add ether1 and wlan1 ports to it:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=wlan1
```
For security reasons you should enable ingress-filtering since you are expecting only tagged traffic, then you can set the bridge to filter out all untagged
traffic. Do the following on AP and ST:
```
/interface bridge port
set [find where interface=ether1 or interface=wlan1] frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged ingress-filtering=yes
```
Set up the bridge VLAN table. Since VLAN99 is going to be our management traffic, then we need to allow this VLAN ID to be able to access the bridge
interface, otherwise, the traffic will be dropped as soon as you will try to access the device. VLAN10 does not need to access the bridge since it is only
meant to be forwarded to the other end. To achieve such functionality add these entries to the bridge VLAN table on AP and ST:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,wlan1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,wlan1,bridge vlan-ids=99
```
```
You can enable RSTP if it is required, but generally, RSTP is not required for PtP links since there should not be any way for a loop to occur.
```
All devices (R1, R2, AP, and ST) need a VLAN interface created to be able to access the device through the specific VLAN ID. For AP and ST create the
VLAN interface on top of the bridge interface and assign an IP address to it:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.X/24 interface=MGMT
```
For R1 and R2 do the same, but the interface, on which you need to create the VLAN interface, will probably change, depending on your setup:
```
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.X/24 interface=MGMT
```
Setup the Wireless link on AP:
```
/interface wireless security-profiles
add authentication-types=wpa2-psk mode=dynamic-keys name=wlan_sec wpa2-pre-shared-key=use_a_long_password_here
/interface wireless
set wlan1 band=5ghz-a/n/ac channel-width=20/40/80mhz-Ceee disabled=no mode=bridge scan-list=5180 security-
profile=wlan_sec ssid=ptp_test
```
Setup the Wireless link on ST:
```
/interface wireless security-profiles
add authentication-types=wpa2-psk mode=dynamic-keys name=wlan_sec wpa2-pre-shared-key=use_a_long_password_here
/interface wireless
set wlan1 band=5ghz-a/n/ac channel-width=20/40/80mhz-Ceee disabled=no mode=station-bridge scan-list=5180
security-profile=wlan_sec ssid=ptp_test
```
When links are set up, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering on AP and ST:
```
You can limit from which interfaces it will be allowed to access the device. For example, if you don't want the device to be accessible from wlan1
, then you can remove the interface from the corresponding bridge VLAN entry.
```
```
For devices with hardware offloaded VLAN filtering and wireless interface support (e.g. RB4011 with RTL8367 switch chip, or LtAP with MT7621
switch chip), more attention needs to be paid. Packets going from HW offloaded ports to wireless can be filtered, if the VLAN access to the CPU
is not allowed. It is possible to allow CPU access for a certain VLAN by adding the bridge interface as a VLAN member (similar to the VLAN99
example) or disabling HW offloading on bridge ports.
```
```
To allow more VLANs to be forwarded, you simply need to specify more VLAN IDs in the bridge VLAN table, you can specify multiple VLANs
divided by coma or even VLAN ranges.
```
```
For each type of setup, there are different requirements, for PtP links NV2 wireless protocol is commonly used. You can read more about NV2
on the NV2 Manual page.
```
/interface bridge
set bridge vlan-filtering=yes
```
Double-check the bridge VLAN table before enabling VLAN filtering. A misconfigured bridge VLAN table can lead to the device being
inaccessible and a configuration reset might be required.

## How WMM works
WMM works by dividing traffic into 4 access categories: background, best effort, video, voice. QoS policy (different handling of access categories) is
applied on transmitted packets, therefore the transmitting device is treating different packets differently, e.g. AP does not have control over how clients are
transmitting packets, and clients do not have control over how AP transmits packets.
Mikrotik AP and client classify packets based on the priority assigned to them, according to the table (as per WMM specification): 1,2 - background 0,3 -
best effort 4,5 - video 6,7 - voice.
To be able to use multiple WMM access categories, not just the best effort where all packets with default priority 0 go, priority must be set for those
packets. By default, all packets (incoming and locally generated) inside the router have priority 0.
The "Better" access category for a packet does not necessarily mean that it will be sent over the air before all other packets with the "worse" access
category. WMM works by executing the DCF method for medium access with different settings for each access category (EDCF), which means that the
"better" access category has a higher probability of getting access to medium - WMM enabled station can be considered to be 4 stations, one per access
category, and the ones with "better" access category use settings that make them more likely to get chance to transmit (by using shorter backoff timeouts)
when all are contending for medium. Details can be studied in 802.11e and WMM specifications.

## How VLAN priority works
The VLAN priority is a 3-bit field called Priority Code Point (PCP) within a VLAN-tagged header and values are between 0 and 7. It is used for
implementing QoS on bridges and switches. MikroTik devices by default are sending VLAN packets (locally generated or encapsulated) with a priority of 0.
The RouterOS bridge forwards VLAN tagged packets unaltered, which means that received VLAN tagged packets with a certain VLAN priority will leave
the bridge with the same VLAN priority. The only exception is when the bridge untags the packet, in this situation VLAN priority is not preserved due to the
missing VLAN header.
More details can be studied in the IEEE 802.1p specification.

## How to set priority
Priority of packets can be set using action=set-priority in IP firewall mangle rules or bridge filter/nat rules. Priority can be set to a specific value or
taken from the ingress priority using the from-ingress setting. Ingress priority is the priority value that was detected on the incoming packet, if available.
Currently, there are 2 sources of ingress priority - priority in the VLAN header and priority from the WMM packet received over a wireless interface. For all
other packets ingress priority is 0.
Note that ingress priority value is not automatically copied to IP mangle priority value, the correct rule needs to be set up to do this.
There are 2 ways to control priority - assign priority with rules with particular matchers (protocol, addresses, etc.) or set it from ingress priority. Both options
require setting up correct rules.
```
WMM support can be enabled using the wmm-support setting. It only applies to bands B and G. Other bands will have it enabled regardless of
this setting
```
This essentially means that if it is not possible or wanted to classify packets by rules, the configuration of the network must be such that the router can
extract ingress priority from incoming frames. Remember there are currently 2 sources for this - VLAN tag in packets and received WMM packets.
Set VLAN or WMM priority based on specific matchers
It is possible to change the VLAN and WMM priorities based on specific matchers in IP mangle or bridge filter/nat rules. In this example, all outgoing ICMP
packets will be sent with a VLAN or WMM priority using the IP mangle rule:
```
/ip firewall mangle
add action=set-priority chain=output new-priority=2 protocol=icmp
```
Custom priority mapping
Sometimes certain VLAN or WMM priorities need to be changed or cleared to a default value. We can use the ingress-priority matcher in IP mangle
or bridge firewall/nat rules to filter only the needed priorities and change them to a different value using the new-priority action setting. For example,
forwarded VLAN tagged packets over a bridge with a priority of 5, need to be changed to 0.
```
/interface bridge filter
add action=set-priority chain=forward ingress-priority=5 new-priority=0
```
Translating WMM priority to VLAN priority inside a bridge
When a wireless packet is received with an already set WMM priority, the RouterOS bridge does not automatically translate it to a VLAN header. It means,
that received wireless packets with WMM priority that get VLAN tagged by the bridge will be forwarded with a VLAN priority of 0. However, we can use a
bridge filter rule with from-ingress setting to keep the priority in VLAN packets. For example, we would like to forward wireless packets over ether2 with
a VLAN 10 header and keep the already set WMM priority (set by the wireless client).
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wlan2 pvid=10
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2 vlan-ids=10
```
```
# translates WMM priority to VLAN priority
/interface bridge filter
add action=set-priority chain=forward new-priority=from-ingress out-interface=ether2
```
The same situation applies when wireless packets are VLAN tagged by the wireless interface using the vlan-mode=use-tag and vlan-id settings. You
still need to use the same bridge filter rule to translate WMM priority to VLAN priority:
```
Do not mix the priority of queues with the priority assigned to packets. Priorities of queues work separately and specify the "importance" of the
queue and have meaning only within a particular queue setup. Think of packet priority as some kind of mark, that gets attached to the packet by
rules. Also, take into account that this mark currently is only used for outgoing packets when going over WMM enabled link, and in case VLAN
tagged packet is sent out (no matter if that packet is tagged locally or bridged).
```
```
/interface wireless
set [ find default-name=wlan2 ] vlan-mode=use-tag vlan-id=10
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wlan2
```
```
# translates WMM priority to VLAN priority
/interface bridge filter
add action=set-priority chain=forward new-priority=from-ingress out-interface=ether2
```
Priority from DSCP
Another way of setting VLAN or WMM priority is by using the DSCP field in the IP header, this can only be done by the IP firewall mangle rule with new-
priority=from-dscp or new-priority=from-dscp-high-3-bits settings and set-priority action property. Note that DSCP in the IP header
can have values 0-63, but priority only 0-7. When using the new-priority=from-dscp setting, the priority will be 3 low bits of the DSCP value, but
when using new-priority=from-dscp-high-3-bits the priority will be 3 high bits of DSCP value.
Remember that DSCP can only be accessed on IP packets and the DSCP value in the IP header should be set somewhere (either by client devices or IP
mangle rules).
It is best to set the DSCP value in the IP header of packets on some border router (e.g. main router used for connection to the Internet), based on traffic
type e.g. set DSCP value for packets coming from the Internet belonging to SIP connections to 7, and 0 for the rest. This way packets must be marked
only in one place. Then all APs on the network can set packet priority from the DSCP value with just one rule.
Set VLAN or WMM priority from DSCP
In this example, the AP device will set WMM priority from DSCP when packets are routed through the wireless interface.
```
/ip firewall mangle
add action=set-priority chain=forward new-priority=from-dscp out-interface=wlan2
```
DSCP from Priority
Similarly, the DSCP value can be set if the received packet contains VLAN or WMM priority. This can be achieved with IP mangle rules with new-
dscp=from-priority or new-dscp=from-priority-to-high-3-bits settings and change-dscp action property. Note that priority in VLAN or
WMM packets can have values 0-7, but DSCP in IP headers are 0-63. When using the new-dscp=from-priority setting, the value of priority will set
the 3 low bits of the DSCP, but when using new-dscp=from-priority-to-high-3-bits  the value of priority will set the 3 high bits of the DSCP.
However, this setting cannot directly use ingress priority from received VLAN or WMM packets. You first need to set priority using IP mangle or bridge filter
/nat rules (ingress priority can be used in this case), and only then apply the DSCP rule.
```
The same principles apply in the other direction. RouterOS does not automatically translate VLAN priority to WMM priority. The same rule new-
priority=from-ingress can be used to translate VLAN priority to WMM priority.
```
```
The RouterOS bridge forwards VLAN tagged packets unaltered, which means that received VLAN tagged packets with a certain VLAN priority
will leave the bridge with the same VLAN priority. The only exception is when the bridge untags the packet, in this situation VLAN priority is not
preserved due to the missing VLAN header.
```
```
When packets are forwarded through a bridge, it is possible to pass packets through IP mangle rules with use-ip-firewall=yes under the
bridge settings.
```
Set DSCP from VLAN or WMM priority
In this example, the AP device needs to set DSCP from WMM priority when packets are routed. First, add a rule to set priority, it will be needed for the
DSCP rule to correctly change the DSCP value. This rule can take priority from ingress. Then add the DSCP rule to change its value.
```
/ip firewall mangle
add action=set-priority chain=prerouting in-interface=wlan2 new-priority=from-ingress
add action=change-dscp chain=prerouting in-interface=wlan2 new-dscp=from-priority
```
Combining priority setting and handling solutions
Complex networks and different situations can be handled by combining different approaches of carrying priority information to ensure QoS and optimize
the use of resources, based on the "building blocks" described above. Several suggestions:
```
The fewer number of filter rules in the whole network, the better (faster). Try classifying packets only when necessary, prefer to do that on fast
routers as most probably connection tracking will be required.
Use DSCP to carry priority information in IP packets forwarded in your network, this way you can use it when needed.
Use VLANs where necessary, as they also carry priority information, make sure Ethernet bridges and switches in the way are not clearing priority
information in the VLAN tag.
Remember that QoS does not improve the throughput of links, it just treats different packets differently, and also that WMM traffic over the
wireless link will discriminate regular traffic in the air.

## Introduction
Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up
that connection.
NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way.
Because of connection tracking you can use stateful firewall functionality even with stateless protocols such as UDP.

## Connection states
Based on connection table entries arrived packet can get assigned one of the connection states: new, invalid, established, related, or untracked.
There are two different methods when the packet is considered new. The first one is in the case of stateless connections (like UDP) when there is no
connection entry in the connection table. The other one is in the case of a stateful protocol (TCP). In this case, a new packet that starts a new connection
is always a TCP packet with an SYN flag.
If a packet is not new it can belong to either an established or related connection or not belong to any connection making it invalid. A packet with an establis
hed state, as most of you already guessed, belongs to an existing connection from the connection tracking table. A related state is very similar, except that
the packet belongs to a connection that is related to one of the existing connections, for example, ICMP error packets or FTP data connection packets.
Connection state notrack is a special case when RAW firewall rules are used to exclude connection from connection tracking. This rule would make all
forwarded traffic bypass the connection tracking, improving packet processing speed through the device.
Any other packet is considered invalid and in most cases should be dropped.
Based on this information we can set a basic set of filter rules to speed up packet filtering and reduce the load on the CPU by accepting established/related
packets, dropping invalid packets, and working on more detailed filtering only for new packets.
```
ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop comment="Drop Invalid connections"
add chain=input connection-state=established,related,untracked action=accept comment="Allow Established/Related
/Untracked connections
```
FastTrack
IPv4 FastTrack is a special handler that bypasses Linux facilities allowing for faster packet forwarding. The handler is used for TCP and UDP connections
marked with "fasttrack-connection" action. IPv4 FastTrack handler supports NAT (SNAT, DNAT, or both).
Note that not all packets of the connection can be FastTracked, so it is likely to see some packets going through a slow path even though the connection is
marked for FastTrack. This is the reason why fasttrack-connection is usually followed by an identical "action=accept" rule.
FastTrack-ed packets are bypassing:
```
firewall,
connection tracking,
simple queues,
queue tree with parent=global,
IP accounting,
IPSec,
hotspot universal client,
VRF assignment
```
It is up to the administrator to make sure FastTrack does not interfere with other configuration.
Requirements
IPv4 FastTrack is active if the following conditions are met:
```
no mesh, metarouter interface configuration;
sniffer, torch, or traffic generator is not running;
/tool mac-scan is not actively used;
/tool ip-scan is not actively used;
FastPath and Route cache is enabled under IP/Settings
```
Example
For example, for SOHO routers with factory default configuration, you could FastTrack all LAN traffic with this one rule placed at the top of the Firewall
Filter. The same configuration accept rule is required:
```
Such a rule set must not be applied on routers with asymmetric routing, because asymmetrically routed packets may be considered invalid and
dropped.
```
```
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=fasttrack-connection connection-state=established,related
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related

# Firewall
The firewall implements stateful (by utilizing connection tracking) and stateless packet filtering and thereby provides security functions that are used to
manage data flow to, from, and through the router. Along with the Network Address Translation (NAT), it serves as a tool for preventing unauthorized
access to directly attached networks and the router itself as well as a filter for outgoing traffic.
Network firewalls keep outside threats away from sensitive data available inside the network. Whenever different networks are joined together, there is
always a threat that someone from outside of your network will break into your LAN. Such break-ins may result in private data being stolen and distributed,
valuable data being altered or destroyed, or entire hard drives being erased. Firewalls are used as a means of preventing or minimizing the security risks
inherent in connecting to other networks. A properly configured firewall plays a key role in efficient and secure network infrastructure deployment.
MikroTik RouterOS has very powerful firewall implementation with features including:
```
stateless packet inspection
stateful packet inspection
Layer-7 protocol detection
peer-to-peer protocols filtering
traffic classification by:
source MAC address
IP addresses (network or list) and address types (broadcast, local, multicast, unicast)
port or port range
IP protocols
protocol options (ICMP type and code fields, TCP flags, IP options and MSS)
interface the packet arrived from or left through
internal flow and connection marks
DSCP byte
packet content
rate at which packets arrive and sequence numbers
packet size
packet arrival time
```
and much more!
Firewall is split in three major modules:
```
filter/raw - used to deny traffic based on configured policies. Filtering in RAW tables allow to save resources if connection tracking is not required.
mangle - used to mark certain connections, packets, streams, set priorities and do other tasks
nat - used to set up address translation rules redirects and port forwarding
```

## Chains
Firewall filtering rules are grouped together in chains. It allows a packet to be matched against one common criterion in one chain, and then passed over
for processing against some other common criteria to another chain.
For example, a packet should be matched against the IP address:port pair. Of course, it could be achieved by adding as many rules with IP address:port
match as required to the forward chain, but a better way could be to add one rule that matches traffic from a particular IP address. Then rules that perform
matching against separate ports can be added to "mychain" chain without specifying the IP addresses.
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=mychain protocol=tcp dst-port=22 action=accept
add chain=mychain protocol=tcp dst-port=23 action=accept
```
```
add chain=input src-address=1.1.1.2/32 jump-target="mychain"
```
When processing a chain, rules are taken from the chain in the order they are listed, from top to bottom. If a packet matches the criteria of the rule, then
the specified action is performed on it, and no more rules are processed in that chain (the exception is the passthrough action).
If a packet has not matched any rule within the chain, then it is accepted.
Each firewall module has its own pre-defined chains:
```
raw:
prerouting
output
filter
input
forward
output
mangle
prerouting
input
forward
output
postrouting
nat
srcnat
dstnat
```
More detailed packet processing in RouterOS is described in the Packet Flow in the RouterOS diagram.

## Introduction
Firewall filters are used to allow or block specific packets forwarded to your local network, originating from your router, or destined to the router.
There are two methods on how to set up filtering:
```
allow specific traffic and drop everything else
drop only malicious traffic, everything else is allowed.
```
Both methods have pros and cons, for example, from a security point of view first method is much more secure, but requires administrator input whenever
traffic for a new service needs to be accepted. This strategy provides good control over the traffic and reduces the possibility of a breach because of
service misconfiguration.
On the other hand, when securing a customer network it would be an administrative nightmare to accept all possible services that users may use.
Therefore careful planning of the firewall is essential in advanced setups.
A firewall filter consists of three predefined chains that cannot be deleted:
```
input - used to process packets entering the router through one of the interfaces with the destination IP address which is one of the router's
addresses. Packets passing through the router are not processed against the rules of the input chain
forward - used to process packets passing through the router
output - used to process packets originating from the router and leaving it through one of the interfaces. Packets passing through the router are
not processed against the rules of the output chain
```
Firewall filter configuration is accessible from ip/firewall/filter menu for IPv4 and ipv6/firewall/filter menu for IPv6.

## Firewall Example
Lets look at basic firewall example to protect router itself and clients behind the router, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
IPv4 firewall
Protect the router itself
Rules of thumb followed to set up the firewall:
```
work with new connections to decrease the load on a router;
accept what you need
drop everything else, log=yes could be set to log some attackers, but keep in mind that it may add some load to he CPU on heavy attacks.
```
We always start by accepting already known and accepted connections, so the first rule should be to accept "established" and "related" connections.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="default configuration" connection-state=established,related
```
Now we can proceed by accepting some new connections, in our example we want to allow access ICMP protocol from any address and everything else
only from 192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 address range. For that we create an address list and two firewall rules.
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 list=allowed_to_router
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input src-address-list=allowed_to_router
add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp
```
And lastly we drop everything else:
```
add action=drop chain=input
```
Complete set of just created rules:
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="default configuration" connection-state=established,related
add action=accept chain=input src-address-list=allowed_to_router
add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp
add action=drop chain=input
/ip firewall address-list
add address=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254 list=allowed_to_router
```
Protect the LAN devices
Concept in protecting the users is very similar, except that in this case we are blocking unwanted traffic and accepting everythign else.
At first we will create address-list with the name "not_in_internet" which we will use for the firewall filter rules:
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=0.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=172.16.0.0/12 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=192.168.0.0/16 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=10.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=169.254.0.0/16 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=127.0.0.0/8 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=224.0.0.0/4 comment=Multicast list=not_in_internet
add address=198.18.0.0/15 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=192.0.0.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=192.0.2.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=198.51.100.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=203.0.113.0/24 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=100.64.0.0/10 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=240.0.0.0/4 comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internet
add address=192.88.99.0/24 comment="6to4 relay Anycast [RFC 3068]" list=not_in_internet
```
Brief firewall filter rule explanation:
```
packets with connection-state=established,related added to FastTrack for faster data throughput, the firewall will work with new connections only;
drop invalid connection and log them with prefix "invalid";
drop attempts to reach not public addresses from your local network, apply address-list=not_in_internet before, "bridge" is local network interface,
log=yes attempts with prefix "!public_from_LAN";
drop incoming packets that are not NAT`ed, ether1 is public interface, log attempts with "!NAT" prefix;
jump to ICMP chain to drop unwanted ICMP messages
drop incoming packets from the Internet, which are not public IP addresses, ether1 is a public interface, log attempts with prefix "!public";
drop packets from LAN that does not have LAN IP, 192.168.88.0/24 is local network used subnet;
```
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment=FastTrack connection-state=established,related
add action=accept chain=forward comment="Established, Related" connection-state=established,related
add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop invalid" connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=invalid
add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop tries to reach not public addresses from LAN" dst-address-
list=not_in_internet in-interface=bridge log=yes log-prefix=!public_from_LAN out-interface=!bridge
add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop incoming packets that are not NAT`ted" connection-nat-state=!dstnat
connection-state=new in-interface=ether1 log=yes log-prefix=!NAT
add action=jump chain=forward protocol=icmp jump-target=icmp comment="jump to ICMP filters"
add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop incoming from internet which is not public IP" in-interface=ether1
log=yes log-prefix=!public src-address-list=not_in_internet
add action=drop chain=forward comment="Drop packets from LAN that do not have LAN IP" in-interface=bridge
log=yes log-prefix=LAN_!LAN src-address=!192.168.88.0/24
```
Allow only needed ICMP codes in "icmp" chain:
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=0:0 action=accept \
comment="echo reply"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:0 action=accept \
comment="net unreachable"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:1 action=accept \
comment="host unreachable"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=3:4 action=accept \
comment="host unreachable fragmentation required"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=8:0 action=accept \
comment="allow echo request"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=11:0 action=accept \
comment="allow time exceed"
add chain=icmp protocol=icmp icmp-options=12:0 action=accept \
comment="allow parameter bad"
add chain=icmp action=drop comment="deny all other types"
```
IPv6 firewall
Protect the router itself
Very similar to IPv4 setup, except that we have to deal with more protocols required for IPv6 to function properly.
At first we create an address-list from which you allow access to the device:
```
/ipv6 firewall address-list add address=fd12:672e:6f65:8899::/64 list=allowed
```
Brief IPv6 firewall filter rule explanation:
```
work with new packets, accept established/related packets;
drop link-local addresses from Internet(public) interface/interface-list;
accept access to a router from link-local addresses, accept multicast addresses for management purposes, accept your source address-list for
router access;
drop anything else;
```
```
/ipv6 firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="allow established and related" connection-state=established,related
add chain=input action=accept protocol=icmpv6 comment="accept ICMPv6"
add chain=input action=accept protocol=udp port=33434-33534 comment="defconf: accept UDP traceroute"
add chain=input action=accept protocol=udp dst-port=546 src-address=fe80::/10 comment="accept DHCPv6-Client
prefix delegation."
add action=drop chain=input in-interface=in_interface_name log=yes log-prefix=dropLL_from_public src-
address=fe80::/10
add action=accept chain=input comment="allow allowed addresses" src-address-list=allowed
add action=drop chain=input
/ipv6 firewall address-list
add address=fe80::/16 list=allowed
add address=xxxx::/48 list=allowed
add address=ff02::/16 comment=multicast list=allowed
```
Protect the LAN devices
This step is more important than it is for IPv4. In IPv4 setups clients mostly have addresses from local address range and are NATed to public IP, that way
they are not directly reachable from the public networks.
IPv6 is a different story. In most common setups, enabled IPv6 makes your clients available from the public networks, so proper firewall filter rules to
protect your customers are mandatory.
In brief we will very basic LAN protection should:
```
accept established/related and work with new packets;
drop invalid packets;
accept ICMPv6 packets;
accept new connections originated only from your clients to the public network;
drop everything else.
```
```
/ipv6 firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward comment=established,related connection-state=established,related
add action=drop chain=forward comment=invalid connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=ipv6,invalid
add action=accept chain=forward comment=icmpv6 in-interface=!in_interface_name protocol=icmpv6
add action=accept chain=forward comment="local network" in-interface=!in_interface_name src-address-list=allowed
add action=drop chain=forward log-prefix=IPV6
```
```
In certain setups where the DHCPv6 relay is used, the src address of the packets may not be from the link-local range. In that case, the src-
address parameter of rule #4 must be removed or adjusted to accept the relay address.
```
Matchers
All matcher properties are common and listed here.
Actions
Tables below shows list of filter specific actions and associated properties.  Other actions are listed here.
```
Property Description
```
```
action (action name; Default: accept)
drop - silently drop the packet
```
```
fasttrack-connection - process packets from a connection
using FastPath by enabling FastTrack for the connection. IP
v4 only.
reject - drop the packet and send an ICMP reject message;
this action allows ICMP reply specification, such as: prohibit
or unreachable admin/host/network/port
tarpit - captures and holds TCP connections (replies with
SYN/ACK to the inbound TCP SYN packet). IPv4 only.
```
```
reject-with (icmp-no-route | icmp-admin-prohibited | icmp-not-neighbour | icmp-
address-unreachable | icmp-port-unreachable | tcp-reset | icmp-err-src-routing-
header | icmp-headers-too-long ; Default: icmp-no-route)
```
```
Specifies ICMP error to be sent back if the packet is rejected.
Applicable if action=reject
```
```
icmp-no-route: sends ICMP address no-route message.
ICMP type 2, code 0
icmp-admin-prohibited: sends ICMP address prohibited
message. ICMP type 2, code 1
icmp-not-neighbour: sends ICMP address not-member
message. ICMP type 2, code 2
icmp-address-unreachable: sends ICMP address
unreachable message. ICMP type 2, code 3
icmp-port-unreachable: sends ICMP port unreachable
message. ICMP type 2, code 4

Routing Header message. ICMP type 2, code 7
icmp-headers-too-long: sends ICMP Headers too long
message. ICMP type 2, code 8
```
RAW Filtering
The firewall RAW table allows to selectively bypass or drop packets before connection tracking, that way significantly reducing the load on the CPU. The
tool is very useful for DoS/DDoS attack mitigation.
RAW filter configuration is accessible from ip/firewall/raw menu for IPv4 and ipv6/firewall/raw menu for IPv6.
The RAW table does not have matchers that depend on connection tracking ( like connection-state, layer7, etc.).
If a packet is marked to bypass the connection tracking packet de-fragmentation will not occur.
Also RAW firewall can have rules only in two chains:
```
prerouting - used to process any packet entering the router
output - used to process packets originated from the router and leaving it through one of the interfaces. Packets passing through the router are
not processed against the rules of the output chain
```
And has one specific action:
```
Property Description
```
```
action (action name;
Default: accept) notrack^ - do not send a packet to connection tracking. Useful when you still need to use regular firewall, but
do not require connection tracking.
```
Basic RAW Example
Let's assume that we have OSPF configuration, but due to connection tracking OSPF have adjacency problems. We can use RAW rules to fix this, by not
sending OSPF packets to connection tracking.
```
/ip firewall raw
add chain=prerouting protocol=ospf action=notrack
add chain=output protocol=ospf action=notrack

# Mangle
```
Introduction
Configuration example

Marking Connections
Mangle Actions
```

## Introduction
Mangle is a kind of 'marker' that marks packets for future processing with special marks. Many other facilities in RouterOS make use of these marks, e.g.
queue trees, NAT, routing. They identify a packet based on its mark and process it accordingly. The mangle marks exist only within the router, they are not
transmitted across the network.
Additionally, the mangle facility is used to modify some fields in the IP header, like TOS (DSCP) and TTL fields.
Firewall mangle rules consist of five predefined chains that cannot be deleted:

The PREROUTING chain: Rules in this chain apply to packets as they just arrive on the network interface;

## Configuration example

## Change MSS
It is a known fact that VPN links have a smaller packet size due to encapsulation overhead. A large packet with MSS that exceeds the MSS of the VPN link
should be fragmented before sending it via that kind of connection. However, if the packet has a Don't Fragment flag set, it cannot be fragmented and
should be discarded. On links that have broken path MTU discovery (PMTUD), it may lead to a number of problems, including problems with FTP and
HTTP data transfer and e-mail services.
In the case of a link with broken PMTUD, a decrease of the MSS of the packets coming through the VPN link resolves the problem. The following example
demonstrates how to decrease the MSS value via mangle:
```
/ip firewall mangle add out-interface=pppoe-out protocol=tcp tcp-flags=syn action=change-mss new-mss=1300
chain=forward tcp-mss=1301-65535
```
Marking Connections
Sometimes it is necessary to perform some actions on the packets belonging to specific connection (for example, to mark packets from/to specific host for
queues), but inspecting each packets IP header is quite expensive task. We can use connection marks to optimize the setup a bit.
```
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=forward in-interface=local src-address=192.168.88.123 connection-state=new action=mark-connection new-
connection-mark=client_conn
add chain=forward connection-mark=client_conn action=mark-packet new-packet-mark=client_p
```

## Introduction
Network Address Translation is an Internet standard that allows hosts on local area networks to use one set of IP addresses for internal communications
and another set of IP addresses for external communications. A LAN that uses NAT is ascribed as a natted network. For NAT to function, there should be
a NAT gateway in each natted network. The NAT gateway (NAT router) performs IP address rewriting on the way while packets travel from/to LAN. In
RouterOS NAT is supported for IPv4. RouterOS does not support NAT64.
Nat matches only the first packet of the connection, connection tracking remembers the action and performs on all other packets belonging to the same
connection.

## Types of NAT:
There are two types of NAT:
```
source NAT or srcnat. This type of NAT is performed on packets that are originated from a natted network. A NAT router replaces the private
source address of an IP packet with a new public IP address as it travels through the router. A reverse operation is applied to the reply packets
traveling in the other direction.
destination NAT or dstnat. This type of NAT is performed on packets that are destined for the natted network. It is most commonly used to make
hosts on a private network to be accessible from the Internet. A NAT router performing dstnat replaces the destination IP address of an IP packet
as it travels through the router toward a private network.
```
Since RouterOS v7 the firewall NAT has two new INPUT and OUTPUT chains which are traversed for packets delivered to and sent from applications
running on the local machine:
```
input - used to process packets entering the router through one of the interfaces with the destination IP address which is one of the router's
addresses. Packets passing through the router are not processed against the rules of the input chain.
```
```
Whenever NAT rules are changed or added, the connection tracking table should be cleared otherwise NAT rules may seem to be not
functioning correctly until the connection entry expires.
```
```
output - used to process packets that originated from the router and leave it through one of the interfaces. Packets passing through the router are
not processed against the rules of the output chain.
```
Destination NAT
Network address translation works by modifying network address information in the packet's IP header. Let`s take a look at the common setup where a
network administrator wants to access an office server from the internet.
We want to allow connections from the internet to the office server whose local IP is 10.0.0.3. In this case, we have to configure a destination address
translation rule on the office gateway router:
```
/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat action=dst-nat dst-address=172.16.16.1 dst-port=22 to-addresses=10.0.0.3
protocol=tcp
```
The rule above translates: when an incoming connection requests TCP port 22 with destination address 172.16.16.1, use the dst-nat action and depart
packets to the device with local IP address 10.0.0.3 and port 22.
Source NAT
If you want to hide your local devices behind your public IP address received from the ISP, you should configure the source network address translation
(masquerading) feature of the MikroTik router.
Let`s assume you want to hide both the office computer and server behind the public IP 172.16.16.1, the rule will look like the following one:
```
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat src-address=10.0.0.0/24 action=src-nat to-addresses=172.16.16.1 out-
interface=WAN
```
Now your ISP will see all the requests coming with IP 172.16.16.1 and they will not see your LAN network IP addresses.
Masquerade
Firewall NAT action=masquerade is a unique subversion of action=srcnat, it was designed for specific use in situations when public IP can
randomly change, for example, DHCP server changes assigned IP or PPPoE tunnel after disconnect gets a different IP, in short - when public IP is dynamic.
```
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat src-address=10.0.0.0/24 action=masquerade out-interface=WAN
```
```
To allow access only from the PC at home, we can improve our dst-nat rule with "src-address=192.168.88.1" which is a Home`s PC public (this
example) IP address. It is also considered to be more secure!
```
Every time when interface disconnects and/or its IP address changes, the router will clear all masqueraded connection tracking entries related to the
interface, this way improving system recovery time after public IP change. If srcnat is used instead of masquerade, connection tracking entries remain
and connections can simply resume after a link failure.
Unfortunately, this can lead to some issues with unstable links when the connection gets routed over different links after the primary link goes down. In
such a scenario following things can happen:
```
on disconnect, all related connection tracking entries are purged;
next packet from every purged (previously masqueraded) connection will come into the firewall as new, and, if a primary interface is not back, a
packet will be routed out via an alternative route (if you have any) thus creating a new masqueraded connection;
the primary link comes back, routing is restored over the primary link, so packets that belong to existing connections are sent over the primary
interface without being masqueraded, that way leaking local IPs to a public network.
```
To work around this situation blackhole route can be created as an alternative to the route that might disappear on disconnect.
Hosts behind a NAT-enabled router do not have true end-to-end connectivity. Therefore some Internet protocols might not work in scenarios with NAT.
Services that require the initiation of TCP connection from outside the private network or stateless protocols such as UDP, can be disrupted.
To overcome these limitations RouterOS includes a number of so-called NAT helpers, that enable NAT traversal for various protocols. When action=src
nat is used instead, connection tracking entries remain and connections can simply resume.
CGNAT (NAT444)
To combat IPv4 address exhaustion, a new RFC 6598 was deployed. The idea is to use shared 100.64.0.0/10 address space inside the carrier's network
and perform NAT on the carrier's edge router to a single public IP or public IP range.
Because of the nature of such a setup, it is also called NAT444, as opposed to a NAT44 network for a 'normal' NAT environment, three different IPv4
address spaces are involved.
CGNAT configuration on RouterOS does not differ from any other regular source NAT configuration:
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=src-nat action=srcnat src-address=100.64.0.0/10 to-address=2.2.2.2 out-interface=<public_if>
```
Where:
```
2.2.2.2 - public IP address,
public_if - interface on provider's edge router connected to the internet
```
The advantage of NAT444 is obvious, fewer public IPv4 addresses are used. But this technique comes with major drawbacks:
```
The service provider router performing CGNAT needs to maintain a state table for all the address translations: this requires a lot of memory and
CPU resources.
Console gaming problems. Some games fail when two subscribers using the same outside public IPv4 address try to connect to each other.
Tracking users for legal reasons means extra logging, as multiple households go behind one public address.
```
```
Though Source NAT and masquerading perform the same fundamental function: mapping one address space into another one, the details differ
slightly. Most noticeably, masquerading chooses the source IP address for the outbound packet from the IP bound to the interface through
which the packet will exit.
```
```
Anything requiring incoming connections is broken. While this already was the case with regular NAT, end-users could usually still set up port
forwarding on their NAT router. CGNAT makes this impossible. This means no web servers can be hosted here, and IP Phones cannot receive
incoming calls by default either.
Some web servers only allow a maximum number of connections from the same public IP address, as a means to counter DoS attacks like SYN
floods. Using CGNAT this limit is reached more often and some services may be of poor quality.
6to4 requires globally reachable addresses and will not work in networks that employ addresses with a limited topological span.
```
Packets with Shared Address Space source or destination addresses MUST NOT be forwarded across Service Provider boundaries. Service Providers
MUST filter such packets on ingress links. In RouterOS this can be easily done with firewall filters on edge routers:
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input src-address=100.64.0.0/10 action=drop in-interface=<public_if>
add chain=output dst-address=100.64.0.0/10 action=drop out-interface=<public_if>
add chain=forward src-address=100.64.0.0/10 action=drop in-interface=<public_if>
add chain=forward src-address=100.64.0.0/10 action=drop out-interface=<public_if>
add chain=forward dst-address=100.64.0.0/10 action=drop out-interface=<public_if>
```
Service providers may be required to log of MAPed addresses, in a large CGN deployed network which may be a problem. Fortunately, RFC 7422
suggests a way to manage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse
response.
RFC states that instead of logging each connection, CGNs could deterministically map customer private addresses (received on the customer-facing
interface of the CGN, a.k.a., internal side) to public addresses extended with port ranges.
That means that separate NAT rules have to be added to achieve individual mappings such as the ones seen in the below example:
```
Inside IP Outside IP/Port range
```
```
100.64.0.1 2.2.2.2:5000-5199
```
```
100.64.0.2 2.2.2.2:5200-5399
```
```
100.64.0.3 2.2.2.2:5400-5599
```
```
100.64.0.4 2.2.2.2:5600-5799
```
```
100.64.0.5 2.2.2.2:5800-5999
```
Instead of writing the rules by hand, it is suggested to use a script instead. The following example could be adapted to any requirements of your setup.

Hairpin NAT
Hairpin network address translation (NAT Loopback) is where the device on the LAN can access another machine on the LAN via the public IP address of
the gateway router.
In the above example, the gateway router has the following dst-nat configuration rule:
```
/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat action=dst-nat dst-address=172.16.16.1 dst-port=443 to-addresses=10.0.0.3 to-
ports=443 protocol=tcp
```
When a user from the PC at home establishes a connection to the web server, the router performs DST NAT as configured:
```
the client sends a packet with a source IP address of 192.168.88.1 to a destination IP address of 172.16.16.1 on port 443 to request some web
resources;
the router destination NAT`s the packet to 10.0.0.3 and replaces the destination IP address in the packet accordingly. The source IP address
stays the same: 192.168.88.1;
the server replies to the client's request and the reply packet has a source IP address of 10.0.0.3 and a destination IP address of 192.168.88.1.
the router determines that the packet is part of a previous connection and undoes the destination NAT, and puts the original destination IP
address into the source IP address field. The destination IP address is 192.168.88.1, and the source IP address is 172.16.16.1;
The client receives the reply packet it expects, and the connection is established;
```

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.

### 1.

### 3.

### 4.
But, there will be a problem, when a client on the same network as the web server requests a connection to the web server's public IP address:
```
the client sends a packet with a source IP address of 10.0.0.2 to a destination IP address of 172.16.16.1 on port 443 to request some web
resources;
the router destination NATs the packet to 10.0.0.3 and replaces the destination IP address in the packet accordingly. The source IP address stays
the same: 10.0.0.2;
the server replies to the client's request. However, the source IP address of the request is on the same subnet as the web server. The web server
does not send the reply back to the router but sends it back directly to 10.0.0.2 with a source IP address in the reply of 10.0.0.3;
The client receives the reply packet, but it discards it because it expects a packet back from 172.16.16.1, and not from 10.0.0.3;
```
To resolve this issue, we will configure a new src-nat rule (the hairpin NAT rule) as follows:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat dst-address=10.0.0.3 out-interface=LAN protocol=tcp src-address=10.0.0.0/24
```
After configuring the rule above:
```
the client sends a packet with a source IP address of 10.0.0.2 to a destination IP address of 172.16.16.1 on port 443 to request some web
resources;
the router destination NATs the packet to 10.0.0.3 and replaces the destination IP address in the packet accordingly. It also source NATs the
packet and replaces the source IP address in the packet with the IP address on its LAN interface. The destination IP address is 10.0.0.3, and the
source IP address is 10.0.0.1;
the web server replies to the request and sends the reply with a source IP address of 10.0.0.3 back to the router's LAN interface IP address of
10.0.0.1;
the router determines that the packet is part of a previous connection and undoes both the source and destination NAT, and puts the original
destination IP address of 10.0.0.3 into the source IP address field, and the original source IP address of 172.16.16.1 into the destination IP
address field
```
Endpoint-Independent NAT
Endpoint-independent NAT creates mapping in the source NAT and uses the same mapping for all subsequent packets with the same source IP and port.
This mapping is created with the following rule:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=endpoint-independent-nat chain=srcnat out-interface=WAN protocol=udp
```
This mapping allows running source-independent filtering, which allows forwarding packets from any source from WAN to mapped internal IP and port. The
following rule enables filtering:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=endpoint-independent-nat chain=dstnat in-interface=WAN protocol=udp
```
Additionally, endpoint-independent-nat can take a few other parameters:
```
randomize-port - randomize to which public port connections will be mapped.
```
More info https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5128.txt section 2.2.3 and 2.2.5
```
Endpoint-independent NAT works only with UDP protocol.
```

## NAT Helpers
Hosts behind a NAT-enabled router do not have true end-to-end connectivity. Therefore some Internet protocols might not work in scenarios with NAT. To
overcome these limitations RouterOS includes a number of NAT helpers, that enable NAT traversal for various protocols.
Nat helpers can be managed from /ip firewall service-ports menu.
List of available nat helpers:
```
Helper Description

```
PPTP PPTP (GRE) tunneling helper
```
```
UDPLITE UDP-Lite service helper
```
```
DCCP DCCP service helper
```
```

```
Property Description
```
```
action (action name;
Default: accept)
dst-nat - replaces the destination address and/or port of an IP packet with values specified by to-addresses a
nd to-ports parameters
masquerade - replaces the source port of an IP packet with one specified by to-ports parameter and replace
the source address of an IP packet to the IP determined by the routing facility.
netmap - creates a static 1:1 mapping of one set of IP addresses to another one. Often used to distribute public
IP addresses to hosts on private networks

```
rate - packet count per time interval per-flow to match
time - specifies the time interval in which the packet count rate per flow cannot be
exceeded (optional, 1s will be used if not specified)
burst - initial number of packets per flow to match: this number gets recharged by

Stateful Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
connection-bytes (
integer-integer;
Default: )
```
```
Matches packets only if a given amount of bytes has been transferred through the particular connection.
```
```
0 - means infinity, for example connection-bytes=2000000-0 means that the rule matches if more than 2MB has been
transferred through the relevant connection
```
```
connection-limit (i
nteger,netmask;
Default: )
```
```
Matches connections per address or address block after a given value is reached. Should be used together with connection-
state=new and/or with tcp-flags=syn because matcher is very resource-intensive
```
```
connection-mark (

Default: )
```
```
Matches packets marked via mangle facility with particular connection mark. If no-mark is set, the rule will match any unmarked
connection
```
```
connection-nat-
state (srcnat |
dstnat; Default: )
```
```
Can match connections that are srcnatted, distracted, or both. Note that connection-state=related connections connection-
nat-state is determined by the direction of the first packet. and if connection tracking needs to use dst-nat to deliver this connection
to the same hosts as the main connection it will be in connection-nat-state=dstnat even if there are no dst-nat rules at all
```
connection-rate (I
nteger 0..
4294967295 ;
Default: )
```
Connection Rate is a firewall matcher that allows capturing traffic based on the present speed of the connection
```
connection-state (
established |
invalid | new |
related |
untracked;
Default: )
```
Interprets the connection tracking analytics data for a particular packet:
```
```
established - a packet that belongs to an existing connection
invalid - a packet that does not have a determined state in connection tracking (usually - severe out-of-order packets,
packets with wrong sequence/ack number, or in case of a resource over usage on the router), for this reason, an invalid
packet will not participate in NAT (as only connection-state=new packets do), and will still contain original source IP address
when routed. We strongly suggest dropping all connection-state=invalid packets in the firewall filter forward and input chains
new - the packet has started a new connection or is otherwise associated with a connection that has not seen packets in both
directions.
related - a packet that is related to, but not parts of an existing connection, such as ICMP errors or a packet that begins an
FTP data connection
untracked - packet that was set to bypass connection tracking in firewall RAW tables.
```
connection-type (f
tp | h323 | irc |
pptp | quake3 |
sip | tftp; Default: )
```
Matches packets from related connections based on information from their connection tracking helpers. A relevant connection
helper must be enabled under the: /ip firewall service-port
```
layer7-protocol (n
ame; Default: )
```
Layer7 filter name defined in layer7 protocol menu. Read more>>.
```
p2p () Matches some unencrypted P2P protocols. Deprecated in modern days since mostly everything is encrypted and requires deep
packet inspection to identify.
```
IPv4 only.
```
realm (integer: 0..
4294967295 ;
Default: )
```
IPv4 only.
```
routing-mark (string
; Default: )
```
Matches packets marked by mangle facility with particular routing mark
```


# Layer7
```
Summary
Properties
Examples
Simple L7 usage example
L7 in the input chain
Youtube Matcher
```

## Summary
Layer7-protocol is a method of searching for patterns in ICMP/TCP/UDP streams.
L7 matcher collects the first 10 packets of a connection or the first 2KB of a connection and searches for the pattern in the collected data. If the pattern is
not found in the collected data, the matcher stops inspecting further. Allocated memory is freed and the protocol is considered unknown. You should take
into account that a lot of connections will significantly increase memory and CPU usage. To avoid this, add regular firewall matchers to reduce the amount
of data passed to layer-7 filters repeatedly.
An additional requirement is that the layer7 matcher must see both directions of traffic (incoming and outgoing). To satisfy this requirement l7 rules should
be set in the forward chain. If the rule is set in the input/prerouting chain then the same rule must be also set in the output/postrouting chain, otherwise, the
collected data may not be complete resulting in an incorrectly matched pattern.
Example L7 patterns compatible with RouterOS can be found on the l7-filter project page.

## Properties
```
/ip firewall layer7-protocol
```
```
Property Description
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of l7 pattern used by configuration in firewall rules. See example >>.
```
```
regexp (string; Default: ) POSIX compliant regular expression is used to match a pattern.
```

## Examples

## Simple L7 usage example
First, add Regexp strings to the protocols menu, to define the strings you will be looking for. In this example, we will use a pattern to match RDP packets.
```
The L7 matcher is very resource-intensive. Use this feature only for very specific traffic. It is not recommended to use the L7 matcher for generic
traffic, such as for blocking web pages. This will almost never work correctly and your device will exhaust its resources, trying to catch all the
traffic. Use other features to block webpages by URL.
```
```
Layer 7 matcher is case insensitive!
```
```
In some cases when layer 7 regular expression cannot be performed, RouterOS will log topic=firewall, warning with an error message stating
the problem in the message!
```
```
/ip firewall layer7-protocol
add name=rdp regexp="rdpdr.*cliprdr.*rdpsnd"
```
Then, use the defined protocols in the firewall.
```
/ip firewall filter
```
```
# add few known protocols to reduce mem usage
add action=accept chain=forward comment="" disabled=no port=80 protocol=tcp
add action=accept chain=forward comment="" disabled=no port=443 protocol=tcp
```
```
# add l7 matcher
add action=accept chain=forward comment="" disabled=no layer7-protocol=\
rdp protocol=tcp
```
As you can see before the l7 rule we added several regular rules that will match known traffic thus reducing memory usage.
L7 in the input chain
In this example, we will try to match the telnet protocol connecting to our router.
```
/ip firewall layer7-protocol add comment="" name=telnet regexp="^\\xff[\\xfb-\\xfe].\\xff[\\xfb-\\xfe].\\xff
[\\xfb-\\xfe]"
```
Note that we need both directions which is why we need also the l7 rule in the output chain that sees outgoing packets.
```
/ip firewall filter
```
```
add action=accept chain=input comment="" disabled=no layer7-protocol=telnet \
protocol=tcp
```
```
add action=passthrough chain=output comment="" disabled=no layer7-protocol=telnet \
protocol=tcp
```
Youtube Matcher
```
/ip firewall layer7-protocol
add name=youtube regexp="(GET \\/videoplayback\\\?|GET \\/crossdomain\\.xml)"
```
```
When a user is logged in YouTube will use HTTPS, meaning that L7 will not be able to match this traffic. Only unencrypted HTTP can be
matched.
```


# Address-lists
```
Summary
Properties
```

## Summary
```
/ip firewall address-list
```
Firewall address lists allow a user to create lists of IP addresses grouped together under a common name. Firewall filter, mangle, and NAT facilities can
then use those address lists to match packets against them.
The address list records can also be updated dynamically via the action=add-src-to-address-list or action=add-dst-to-address-list item
s found in NAT, Mangle, and Filter facilities.
Firewall rules with action add-src-to-address-list or add-dst-to-address-list work in passthrough mode, which means that the matched
packets will be passed to the next firewall rules.

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
address (DNS Name | IP
address/netmask | IP-IP; Default:
)
```
```
A single IP address or range of IPs to add to the address list or DNS name. You can input for example,
'192.168.0.0-192.168.1.255' and it will auto modify the typed entry to 192.168.0.0/23 on saving.
```
```
dynamic (yes, no) Allows creating data entry with dynamic form.
```
```
list (string; Default: ) Name for the address list of the added IP address.
```
```
timeout (time; Default: ) Time after address will be removed from the address list. If the timeout is not specified, the address will be
stored in the address list permanently.
```
```
creation-time (time; Default: ) The time when the entry was created.
```


# Example
The following example creates a dynamic address list of people who are connecting to port 23 (telnet) on the router and drops all further traffic from them
for 5 minutes. Additionally, the address list will also contain one static address list entry of 192.0.34.166/32 (www.example.com):
```
/ip firewall address-list add list=drop_traffic address=192.0.34.166/32
```
```
/ip firewall address-list print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# LIST ADDRESS
0 drop_traffic 192.0.34.166
```
```
If the timeout parameter is not specified, then the address will be saved to the list permanently on the disk. If a timeout is specified, the address
will be stored on the RAM and will be removed after a system's reboot.
```
```
/ip firewall mangle add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=drop_traffic address-list-timeout=5m
chain=prerouting dst-port=23 protocol=tcp
/ip firewall filter add action=drop chain=input src-address-list=drop_traffic
```
```
/ip firewall address-list print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# LIST ADDRESS
0 drop_traffic 192.0.34.166
1 D drop_traffic 1.1.1.1
2 D drop_traffic 10.5.11.8
```
As seen in the output of the last print command, two new dynamic entries appeared in the address list (marked with a status of 'D'). Hosts with these IP
addresses tried to initialize a telnet session to the router and were then subsequently dropped by the filter rule.

## Understanding Packet Flow
More advanced firewall setups, or complicated tasks, such as traffic prioritization, routing policies, where it is necessary to utilize more than one RouterOS
facility, require knowledge: How do these facilities work together? What happens when and why?
RouterOS packet flow diagram and flow examples will try to answer these questions.
It would be very complicated to represent what is going on with the packet in one diagram, therefore a packet flow diagram is divided into three parts:
```
overall diagram;
detailed bridging, routing, and MPLS flow diagram;
a diagram that shows what facilities and in what order are included in prerouting, input, forward, output, and postrouting.
```

## Overall Packetflow Diagram
Let's look at the overall diagram. It looks complicated at first, but after we go through the diagram with examples it will become much clearer.
There are 4 boxes in the center of the diagram: Bridging, Routing, Mpls decisions, and local router processes. So for example, if the packet needs to be
routed over the router, a packet will flow as illustrated in the image below. Without looking deeper into each facility, the packet enters the in-interface, the
router determines that it is IP traffic and needs to be routed, the packet goes through all routing processes and exits the out-interface.
Let's take a look at another example that will illustrate what happens if the packet's destination is a router. For example, the in-interface receives ICMP
(ping) packet, its destination is the router itself, so the packet will go for local-in processing. After the packet is processed ICMP (ping) reply is generated
inside the router (local-out processing) and will be sent out over the out-interface.
A simple explanation of each box before we go further with examples:
```
physical in-interface - the starting point of the packet received by the router;
logical in-interface - the starting point of the decapsulated packet (from tunnels, IPsec, etc);
local in - the last point of a packet destined to router itself;
interface HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) - interface queue;
physical out-interface - last point of the packet before it is actually sent out;
logical out-interface - last point of the packet before encapsulation (to tunnels, IPsec, etc);
local out - the starting point of a packet generated by the router;
```
Now it is time to take a deeper look at what is happening inside bridging, MPLS, and routing flows.
A simple explanation of each box before we go further with examples:
```
routing decision - go through routes in the routing table to find a match for the destination IP address of the packet. When a match is found - the
packet will be processed further, in case of no match - the packet will be discarded.;
mpls decision - what to do with the packet based on MPLS forwarding tables;
bridging decision - bridge goes through the MAC address table to find a match for the destination MAC address of the packet. When a match is
found - the packet will be processed further, in case of no match - multiple copies of the packet will be created and packets will be flooded (sent
out via all bridge ports). A single packet copy will also reach a bridge input chain as the bridge interface itself is one of the many destinations.
When using vlan-filtering=yes, packets that are not allowed due to the "/interface bridge vlan" table, will be dropped at this stage.
use-ip-firewall - whether a 'use-ip-firewall' option is enabled in bridge settings;
ipsec-policy - whether a packet matches any of configured IPsec policies;
```
Chains
RouterOS consist of a few default chains. These chains allow you to filter packets at various points:
```
The PREROUTING chain: Rules in this chain apply to packets as they just arrive on the network interface. This chain is present in the nat, mangle
and raw tables.
The INPUT chain: Rules in this chain apply to packets just before they’re given to a local process. This chain is present in the mangle and filter
tables.
The OUTPUT chain: The rules here apply to packets just after they’ve been produced by a process. This chain is present in the raw, mangle, nat,
and filter tables.
The FORWARD chain: The rules here apply to any packets that are routed through the current host. This chain is only present in the mangle and fi
lter tables.
The POSTROUTING chain: The rules in this chain apply to packets as they just leave the network interface. This chain is present in the nat and m
angle tables.
```
Each of the prerouting, input, forward, output, and postrouting blocks contains even more facilities, which are illustrated in the third part of the packet flow
diagram:
A simple explanation of each box before we go further with examples:
```
Hotspot-in - allows to capture traffic that otherwise would be discarded by connection tracking - this way our Hotspot feature is able to provide
connectivity even if networks settings are an incomplete mess ;
RAW Prerouting - RAW table prerouting chain;
Connection tracking - packet is processed by connection tracking;
Mangle Prerouting - Mangle prerouting chain;
Mangle Input - Mangle input chain;
Filter Input - Firewall filter input chain;
HTB Global - Queue tree;
Simple Queues - is a feature that can be used to limit traffic for a particular target;
TTL - indicates an exact place where the Time To Live (TTL) of the routed packet is reduced by 1 if TTL becomes 0, a packet will be discarded;
Mangle Forward - Mangle forward chain;
Filter Forward - Filter forward chain;
Accounting - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting feature processing;
RAW Output - RAW table output chain;
Mangle Output - Mangle output chain;
Filter Output - Firewall filter output chain;
Routing Adjustment - this is a workaround that allows to set up policy routing in mangle chain output (routing-mark) ;

Flow of Routed Packet
Forward
Now, let's take our first example where the packet gets routed over the router and look deeper through what facilities packet goes:
We already learned that packet goes into the in-interface, the router
determines that it is an IP packet and needs to be routed, and here starts the
complicated process:
```
The packet enters prerouting processing:
check if there is a hotspot and modify the packet for
hotspot use
process packet through RAW prerouting chain;
send the packet through connection tracking;
process packet through Mangle prerouting chain;
 process packet through NATs dst-nat chain;
Run packet through routing table to make routing decision;
The packet enters the forward process;
check TTL value;
process packet through Mangle forward chain;
process packet through the Filter forward chain;
send the packet to accounting processes;
```
```
A packet enters postrouting process;
process packet through Mangle postrouting chain;
process packet through NATs src-nat chain;
if there is a hotspot undo any modifications made in
hotspot-in;
process packet through queue tree (HTB Global);
process packet through simple queues;
```
```
Check if there is IPsec and then process through IPsec policies;
```

Flow of Bridged Packet

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.
Below is discussed a general bridging process in RouterOS. Most of the packets will always follow the same processing path, but in certain configurations
(e.g. with enabled VLAN filtering, horizon, STP, DHCP, or IGMP snooping) some packets can be treated differently. Please visit the bridging manual for
more specific information.
Bridge Forward
Bridge forward is a process that takes place when a packet is forwarded from one bridge port to another, essentially connecting multiple devices on the
same network. After receiving a packet on the in-interface, the device determines that the in-interface is a bridge port, so it gets passed through the
bridging process:
```
A packet goes through the bridge NAT dst-nat chain, where MAC
destination and priority can be changed, apart from that, a packet
can be simply accepted, dropped, or marked;
Checks whether the use-ip-firewall option is enabled in the bridge
settings;
Run packet through the bridge host table to make a forwarding
decision. A packet that ends up being flooded (e.g. broadcast,
multicast, unknown unicast traffic), gets multiplied per bridge port
and then processed further in the bridge forward chain. When
using vlan-filtering=yes, packets that are not allowed due
to the "/interface bridge vlan" table, will be dropped at this stage.
```

### 4.

### 5.

### 6.

### 7.
```
A packet goes through the bridge filter forward chain, where
priority can be changed or the packet can be simply accepted,
dropped, or marked;
Checks whether the use-ip-firewall option is enabled in the bridge
settings;
A packet goes through the bridge NAT src-nat chain, where MAC
source and priority can be changed, apart from that, a packet can
be simply accepted, dropped, or marked;
Checks whether the use-ip-firewall option is enabled in the bridge
settings;
```
```
For RouterOS v6:
When bridge vlan-filtering is enabled, received untagged packets might get encapsulated into the VLAN header before the "DST-NAT"
block, which means these packets can be filtered using the mac-protocol=vlan and vlan-encap settings. Encapsulation can happen if the
outgoing interface has frame-types set to admit-all or admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged.
```
```
Tagged packets might get decapsulated on the "BRIDGING DECISION" block, which means these packets will no longer match the mac-
protocol=vlan and vlan-encap settings. Decapsulation can happen if the packet's VLAN ID matches the outgoing port's untagged VLAN
membership.
```
```
For RouterOS v7 and newer:
```

Bridge Input
Bridge input is a process that takes place when a packet is destined for the bridge interface. Most commonly this happens when you need to reach some
services that are running on the bridge interface (e.g. a DHCP server) or you need to route traffic to other networks. The very first steps are similar to the
bridge forward process - after receiving a packet on the in-interface, the device determines that the in-interface is a bridge port, so it gets passed through
the bridging process:
```
A packet goes through the bridge NAT dst-nat chain, where MAC destination
and priority can be changed, apart from that, a packet can be simply accepted,
dropped, or marked;
Checks whether the use-ip-firewall option is enabled in the bridge settings;
Run packet through the bridge host table to make a forwarding decision. A
packet where the destination MAC address matches the bridge MAC address
will be passed to the bridge input chain. A packet that ends up being flooded (e.
g. broadcast, multicast, unknown unicast traffic), also reaches the bridge input
chain as the bridge interface itself is one of the many destinations;
A packet goes through the bridge filter input chain, where priority can be
changed or the packet can be simply accepted, dropped, or marked;
```
```
When bridge vlan-filtering is enabled, received untagged packets might get encapsulated into the VLAN header on the "BRIDGING-
DECISION" block, which means these packets can be filtered using the mac-protocol=vlan and vlan-encap settings.  Encapsulation can
happen if the outgoing interface has frame-types set to admit-all or admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged.
```
```
Tagged packets might get decapsulated on the "BRIDGING DECISION" block, which means these packets will no longer match the mac-
protocol=vlan and vlan-encap settings. Decapsulation can happen if the packet's VLAN ID matches the outgoing port's untagged VLAN
membership.
```

### 3.

### 4.
Bridge Output
Bridge output is a process that takes place when a packet should exit the device through one or multiple bridge ports. Most commonly this happens when
a bridge interface itself tries to reach a device connected to a certain bridge port (e.g. when a DHCP server running on a bridge interface is responding to a
DHCP client). After a packet is processed on other higher-level RouterOS processes and the device finally determines that the output interface is a bridge,
the packet gets passed through the bridging process:
```
Run packet through the bridge host table to make a forwarding decision. A
packet that ends up being flooded (e.g. broadcast, multicast, unknown unicast
traffic), gets multiplied per bridge port and then processed further in the bridge
output chain.
A packet goes through the bridge filter output chain, where priority can be
changed or the packet can be simply accepted, dropped, or marked;
A packet goes through the bridge NAT src-nat chain, where MAC source and
priority can be changed, apart from that, a packet can be simply accepted,
dropped, or marked;
Checks whether the use-ip-firewall option is enabled in the bridge settings;

Forward With Firewall Enabled
In certain network configurations, you might need to enable additional processing on routing chains for bridged traffic, for example, to use simple queues or
an IP firewall. This can be done when the use-ip-firewall is enabled under the bridge settings. Note that additional processing will consume more CPU
resources to handle these packets. All the steps were already discussed in previous points, below is a recap:
```
A packet goes through the bridge NAT dst-nat chain;
With the use-ip-firewall option enabled, the packet will be further processed in
the prerouting chain;
A packet enters prerouting processing;
Run packet through the bridge host table to make forwarding decision;
A packet goes through the bridge filter forward chain;
With the use-ip-firewall option enabled, the packet will be further processed in
the routing forward chain;
A packet enters routing forward processing;
A packet goes through the bridge NAT src-nat chain;
With the use-ip-firewall option enabled, the packet will be further processed in
the postrouting chain;
A packet enters postrouting processing;
```
Flow of Hardware Offloaded Packet
On the previous topic, we solely discussed a software bridging that requires the main CPU processing to forward packets through the correct bridge port.
Most of the MikroTik devices are equipped with dedicated switching hardware, the so-called switch chip or switch ASIC. This allows us to offload some of
the bridging functions, like packet forwarding between bridge ports or packet filtering, to this specialized hardware chip without consuming any CPU
resources. In RouterOS, we have named this function Bridge Hardware (HW) Offloading. Different MikroTik devices might have different switch chips and
each chip has a different set of features available, so make sure to visit this article to get more details - Bridge Hardware Offloading.
```
switching decision - widely depends on the switch model. This block controls all the switching-related tasks, like host learning, packet forwarding,
filtering, VLAN tagging/untagging, etc. Certain switch configurations can alter the packet flow;
switch-cpu port - a special purpose switch port for communication between the main CPU and other switch ports. Note that the switch-cpu port
does not show up anywhere on RouterOS except for the switch menu, none of the software-related configurations (e.g. interface-list) can be
applied to this port. Packets that reach the CPU are automatically associated with the physical in-interface.
```
```
Interface HTB will not work correctly when the out-interface is hardware offloaded and the bridge Fast Path is not active.
```

### 1.

### 2.
The hardware offloading, however, does not restrict a device to only hardware limited features, rather it is possible to take advantage of the hardware and
software processing at the same time. This does require a profound understanding of how packets travel through the switch chip and when exactly they
are passed to the main CPU.
Switch Forward
We will further discuss a packet flow when bridge hardware offloading is enabled and a packet is forwarded between two switched ports on a single switch
chip. This is the most common and also the simplest example:
```
The switch checks whether the in-interface is a hardware offloaded
interface;
Run a packet through the switch host table to make a forwarding
decision. If the switch finds a match for the destination MAC
address, the packet is sent out through the physical interface. A
packet that ends up being flooded (e.g. broadcast, multicast,
unknown unicast traffic) gets multiplied and sent out to every
hardware offloaded switch port.
```
Switch to CPU Input
This process takes place when a packet is received on a physical interface and it is destined to switch-cpu port for further software processing. There are
two paths to the switch-cpu. One where hardware offloading and switching is not even used (e.g. a standalone interface for routing or a bridged interface
but with deliberately disabled HW offloading), so the packet is simply passed further for software processing. Another path is taken when hardware
offloading is active on the in-interface. This will cause the packet to pass through the switching decision and there are various reasons why the switch
might forward the packet to the switch-cpu port:
```
a packet's destination MAC address match with a local MAC address, e.g. when a packet is destined to a local bridge interface;
a packet might get flooded to all switch ports including the switch-cpu port, e.g. when broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic is received;
```
```
Switch features found in the "/interface/ethernet/switch" menu and its sub-menus, like ACL rules, mirroring, ingress/egress rate limiters, QoS,
and L3HW (except inter-VLAN routing) may not rely on bridge hardware offloading. Therefore, they can potentially be applied to interfaces not
configured within a hardware-offloaded bridge.
```

```
a switch might have learned that some hosts can only be reached through the CPU (switch-cpu port learning is discussed in the next section), e.
g. when a bridge contains HW and non-HW offloaded interfaces, such as wireless, EoIP, and even Ethernet interfaces;
a packet is intentionally copied to the switch-cpu, e.g. for a packet inspection;
a packet is triggered by the switch configuration and should be processed in software, e.g. a DHCP or IGMP snooping.
```
See the packet walkthrough when an in-interface is hardware offloaded:
```
The switch checks whether the in-interface is a hardware offloaded
interface;
Run a packet through the switch host table to make a forwarding
decision. In case any of the above-mentioned points are true, the
packet gets forwarded to the switch-cpu port.
The packet exits through the switch-cpu port and it will be further
processed by the RouterOS packet flow.
```
CPU Output to Switch
This process takes place when a packet exits the RouterOS software processing and is received on the switch-cpu port. Again, there are two paths the
packet can take. One where hardware offloading and switching are not even used (e.g. a standalone interface for routing or a bridged interface but with
deliberately disabled HW offloading), so the packet is simply sent out through the physical out-interface. Another path is taken when hardware offloading is
active on the out-interface. This will cause the packet to pass through the switching decision. Just like any other switch port, the switch will learn the source
MAC addresses from packets that are received on the switch-cpu port. This does come in handy when a bridge contains HW and non-HW offloaded
interfaces, so the switch can learn which frames should be forwarded to the CPU. See the packet walkthrough when an out-interface is hardware offloaded:
```
A packet that exits the RouterOS software processing is received
on the switch-cpu port;
The switch checks whether the out-interface is a hardware
offloaded interface;
Run a packet through the switch host table to make a forwarding
decision. If the switch finds a match for the destination MAC
```
```
Any received packet that was flooded by the switch chip will not get flooded again by the software bridge to the same HW offloaded switch
group. This prevents the formation of duplicate packets.

```
address, the packet is sent out through the physical interface. A
packet that ends up being flooded (e.g. broadcast, multicast,
unknown unicast traffic) gets multiplied and sent out to every
hardware offloaded switch port.
```
Flow of MPLS Packet
```
A software bridge that sends a flooded packet through HW offloaded interfaces, will only send a single packet copy per HW offloaded switch
group rather than per HW offloaded interface. The actual flooding will be done by the switch chip, this prevents the formation of duplicate
packets.

MPLS IP VPN
In VPNv4 setups packet arriving at PE router that needs to be forwarded to the CE router is not a typical "forward".
If incoming label and destination is bound to the VRF Then after MPLS label is popped and:
```
destination address is local to the router, then packet is moved to LOCAL_IN
destination address is in the CE network, then packet is moved to LOCAL_OUT

Packet will be seen in the output and postrouting chains, because now it is locally originated packet with source MAC address equal to vrfInterface:

18:3b, proto ICMP (type 8, code 0), 111.15.0.1->111.13.0.1, len 56
```
```
Forwarded packets from MPLS cloud to the CE network will not show up in the forward.
```
On the other hand, for packets routed in the direction CE→PE will be seen in the "forward" as any other routed IP traffic before being sent to the MPLS:
```
08:10:55 firewall,info prerouting: in:sfp-sfpplus2 out:(unknown 0), connection-state:established src-mac dc:2c:
6e:46:f8:93, proto ICMP (type 0, code 0), 111.13.0.1->111.15.0.1, len 56
08:10:55 firewall,info forward: in:sfp-sfpplus2 out:sfp-sfpplus1, connection-state:established src-mac dc:2c:
6e:46:f8:93, proto ICMP (type 0, code 0), 111.13.0.1->111.15.0.1, len 56
08:10:55 firewall,info postrouting: in:sfp-sfpplus2 out:sfp-sfpplus1, connection-state:established src-mac dc:
2c:6e:46:f8:93, proto ICMP (type 0, code 0), 111.13.0.1->111.15.0.1, len 56
```
But there can be an exception. If destination IP of reply packet is local to the router and connection tracking is performing NAT translation then connection
tracking will "force" packet to move through the firewall prerouting/forward/postrouting chains.
Logical Interfaces
So far we looked at examples when in or out interfaces are actual physical interfaces (Ethernet, wireless), but how packets will flow if the router receives
tunnel encapsulated packets?
Let's assume that there is an IPIP packet coming into the router. Since it is a regular ipv4 packet it will be processed through all routing-related facilities (
until "J" in the diagram). Then the router will look if the packet needs to be decapsulated., in this case, it is an IPIP packet so "yes" send the packet to
decapsulation. After that packet will go another loop through all the facilities but this time as a decapsulated IPv4 packet.
It is very important because the packet actually travels through the firewall twice, so if there is a strict firewall, then there should be "accept" rules for IPIP
encapsulated packets as well as decapsulated IP packets.
IPSec Policies
Let's take a look at another tunnel type - IPSec. This type of VPN does not have logical interfaces but is processed in a similar manner.
Instead of logical interfaces packets are processed through IPSec policies. After routing
decision (2) and input firewall processing (3), the router tries to match the source and
```
Packet encapsulation and decapsulation using a bridge with enabled vlan-filtering do not relate to logical interfaces. See more details in
the bridging section.
```
destination to the IPsec policy. When policy matches the packet it is sent to decryption
(5). After the decryption packet enters PREROUTING processing again (6) and starts
another processing loop, but now with the decapsulated packet.
The same process is with encapsulation but in reverse order. The first IP packet gets
processed through facilities, then matched against IPsec policies (5), encapsulated (6),
and then sent to processing on the second loop (7-10).
Fast Path
From what we learned so far, it is quite obvious that such packet processing takes a lot of CPU resources. To fast things up FastPath was introduced in
the first RouterOS v6. What it does is it skips processing in the Linux kernel, basically trading some RouterOS functionality for performance. For FastPath
to work, interface driver support and specific configuration conditions are required.
How Fast Path Works
FastPath is an interface driver extension, that allows a driver to talk directly to specific RouterOS facilities and skip all others.
The packet can be forwarded by a fast path handler only if at least the source interface supports a fast path. For complete fast-forwarding, destination
interface support is also required.
Currently, RouterOS has the following FastPath handlers:
```
IPv4
IPv4 FastTrack
Traffic Generator
MPLS
Bridge
```
IPv4 FastPath handler is used if the following conditions are met:
```
firewall rules are not configured;
simple queue or queue trees with parent=global are not configured;
no mesh, metarouter interface configuration;
sniffer or torch is not running;
connection tracking is not active;
IP accounting is disabled;
VRFs are not configured (/ip route vrf is empty);
```
```
A hotspot is not used (/ip hotspot has no interfaces);
IPSec policies are not configured;
/tool mac-scan is not actively used;
/tool ip-scan is not actively used.
```
Traffic Generator automatically use FastPath if the interface supports this feature.
Currently, MPLS fast-path applies to MPLS switched traffic (frames that enter router as MPLS and must leave router as MPLS) and VPLS endpoint that do
VPLS encap/decap. Other MPLS ingress and egress will operate as before.
A Bridge handler is used if the following conditions are met:
```
there are no bridge Calea, filter, NAT rules;
use-ip-firewall is disabled;
no mesh, MetaRouter interface configuration;
sniffer, torch, and traffic generator are not running;
bridge vlan-filtering is disabled (condition is removed since RouterOS 7.2 version);
bridge dhcp-snooping is disabled.
```
Interfaces that support FastPath:
```
RouterBoard Interfaces
```
```
RB6xx series ether1,2
```
```
RB800 ether1,2
```
```
RB1100 series ether1-11
```
```
All devices Ethernet interfaces
```
```
wireless interfaces
```
```
bridge interfaces
```
```
VLAN, VRRP interfaces
```
```
bonding interfaces (RX only)
```
```
PPPoE, L2TP interfaces
```
```
EoIP, GRE, IPIP, VXLAN interfaces.
```
```
VPLS (starting from v7.17)
```
EoIP, Gre, IPIP, VXLAN and L2TP interfaces have per-interface setting allow-fast-path. Allowing a fast path on these interfaces has a side effect of
bypassing firewall, connection tracking, simple queues, queue tree with parent=global, IP accounting, IPsec, hotspot universal client, vrf assignment for
encapsulated packets that go through a fast-path. Also, packet fragments cannot be received in FastPath.
```
Packets will travel the FastPath way if FastTrack is used no matter if the above conditions are met.
```
```
FastPath on the vlan-filtering bridge does NOT support priority-tagged packets (packets with VLAN header but VLAN ID = 0). Those packets are
redirected via a slow path.
```
```
Whether FastPath is being used can be verified with /interface print stats-detail
```
Only interface queue that guarantees FastPath is only-hardware-queue. If you need an interface queue other than hardware then the packet will not go
fully FastPath, but there is not a big impact on performance, as "interface queue" is the last step in the packet flow.
The packet may go Half-FastPath by switching from FastPath to SlowPath, but not the other way around. So, for example, if the receiving interface has
FastPath support, but the out interface does not, then the router will process the packet by FastPath handlers as far as it can and then proceed with
SlowPath. If the receiving interface does not support FastPath but the out interface does, the packet will be processed by SlowPath all the way through the
router.
FastTrack
Fasttrack can be decoded as Fast Path + Connection Tracking. It allows marking connections as "fast-tracked", marking packets that belong to fast-
tracked connection will be sent fast-path way. The connection table entry for such a connection now will have a fast-tracked flag.
To mark a connection as fast-tracked new action was implemented "fasttrack-connection" for firewall filter and mangle. Currently, only IPv4 TCP and UDP
connections can be fast-tracked and to maintain connection tracking entries some random packets will still be sent to a slow path. This must be taken into
consideration when designing firewalls with enabled "fasttrack".
FastTrack handler also supports source and destination NAT, so special exceptions for NATed connections are not required.
The easiest way to start using this feature on home routers is to enable "fasttrack" for all established, related connections:
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=fasttrack-connection connection-state=established,related \
comment="fasttrack established/related"
add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related \
comment="accept established/related"
```
Notice that the first rule marks established/related connections as fast-tracked, the second rule is still required to accept packets belonging to those
connections. The reason for this is that, as was mentioned earlier, some random packets from fast-tracked connections are still sent the slow pathway and
only UDP and TCP are fast-tracked, but we still want to accept packets for other protocols.
After adding the "FastTrack" rule special dummy rule appeared at the top of the list. This is not an actual rule, it is for visual information showing that some
of the traffic is traveling FastPath and will not reach other firewall rules.
```
FastTrack packets bypass firewall, connection tracking, simple queues, queue tree with parent=global, ip traffic-flow, IP accounting, IPSec,
hotspot universal client, VRF assignment, so it is up to the administrator to make sure FastTrack does not interfere with other configuration!
```
```
Traffic that belongs to a fast-tracked connection travels in FastPath, which means that it will not be visible by other router L3 facilities (firewall,
queues, IPsec, IP accounting, VRF assignment, etc). Fasttrack lookups route before routing marks have been set, so it works only with the main
routing table.
```
These rules appear as soon as there is at least one fast-tracked connection tracking entry and will disappear after the last fast-tracked connection times
out in the connection table.
Configuration example: excluding specific host, from being Fast-Tracked
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related src-address=192.168.88.111
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related dst-address=192.168.88.111
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related hw-offload=no
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
```
In this example, we exclude host 192.168.88.111, from being Fast-tracked, by first accepting it with the firewall rule, both for source and destination. The
idea is - not allowing the traffic to reach the FastTrack action.
Note: the "exclusion" rules, must be placed before fasttrack filters, order is important.
Requirements
IPv4 FastTrack is active if the following conditions are met:
```
no mesh, metarouter interface configuration;
sniffer, torch, and traffic generator are not running;
"/tool mac-scan" is not actively used;
"/tool ip-scan" is not actively used;
FastPath and Route cache are enabled under IP/Settings (route cache condition does not apply to RouterOS v7 or newer);
bridge FastPath is enabled if a connection is going over the bridge interface;
```
Packet flow for the visually impaired
The following document in DOCX format describes the diagram in a way optimized for visually impaired people. The descriptions are by Apex CoVantage
care of Benetech. They are not being updated.
```
Packet flow, optimized document.
```
```
FastTrack can process packets only in the main routing table so it is the system administrator duty to not FastTrack connections that are going
through non-main routing table (thus connections that are processed with mangle action=mark-routing rules). Otherwise packets might be
misrouted though the main routing table.
```
```
The connection is FastTracked until a connection is closed, timed out or the router is rebooted.

## Overview
A queue is a collection of data packets collectively waiting to be transmitted by a network device using a pre-defined structure methodology. Queuing
works almost on the same methodology used at banks or supermarkets, where the customer is treated according to its arrival.
Queues are used to:
```
limit data rate for certain IP addresses, subnets, protocols, ports, etc.;
limit peer-to-peer traffic;
packet prioritization;
configure traffic bursts for traffic acceleration;
apply different time-based limits;
share available traffic among users equally, or depending on the load of the channel
```
Queue implementation in MikroTik RouterOS is based on Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB). HTB allows the creation of a hierarchical queue structure and
determines relations between queues. These hierarchical structures can be attached at two different places, the Packet Flow diagram illustrates both input
and postrouting chains.
There are two different ways how to configure queues in RouterOS:
```
/queue simple menu - designed to ease the configuration of simple, every day queuing tasks (such as single client upload/download limitation,
p2p traffic limitation, etc.).
/queue tree menu - for implementing advanced queuing tasks (such as global prioritization policy, and user group limitations). Requires marked
packet flows from  /ip firewall mangle facility.
```
RouterOS provides a possibility to configure queue in 8 levels -  the first level is an interface queue from the "/queue interface" menu and the other 7 are
lower-level queues that can be created in Queue Simple and/or Queue Tree.

## Rate limitation principles
Rate limiting is used to control the rate of traffic flow sent or received on a network interface. Traffic with rate that is less than or equal to the specified rate
is sent, whereas traffic that exceeds the rate is dropped or delayed.
Rate limiting can be performed in two ways:
```
discard all packets that exceed rate limit – rate-limiting (dropper or shaper) (100% rate limiter when queue-size=0)
delay packets that exceed the specific rate limit in the queue and transmit them when it is possible – rate equalizing (scheduler) (100% rate
equalizing when queue-size=unlimited)
```
The next figure explains the difference between rate limiting and rate equalizing:
As you can see in the first case all traffic exceeds a specific rate and is dropped. In another case, traffic exceeds a specific rate and is delayed in the
queue and transmitted later when it is possible, but note that the packet can be delayed only until the queue is not full. If there is no more space in the
queue buffer, packets are dropped.
For each queue we can define two rate limits:
```
CIR (Committed Information Rate) – (limit-at in RouterOS) worst-case scenario, the flow will get this amount of traffic rate regardless of other
traffic flows. At any given time, the bandwidth should not fall below this committed rate.
MIR (Maximum Information Rate) – (max-limit in RouterOS) best-case scenario, the maximum available data rate for flow, if there is free any part
of the bandwidth.
```
Simple Queue
```
/queue simple
```
A simple queue is a plain way how to limit traffic for a particular target. Also, you can use simple queues to build advanced QoS applications. They have
useful integrated features:
```
peer-to-peer traffic queuing;
applying queue rules on chosen time intervals;
prioritization;
using multiple packet marks from /ip firewall mangle
traffic shaping (scheduling) of bidirectional traffic (one limit for the total of upload + download)
```
Configuration example
In the following example, we have one SOHO device with two connected units PC and Server.
```
Simple queues have a strict order - each packet must go through every queue until it reaches one queue which conditions fit packet parameters
or until the end of the queues list is reached. For example, In the case of 1000 queues, a packet for the last queue will need to proceed through
999 queues before it will reach the destination.
```
We have a 15 Mbps connection available from ISP in this case. We want to be sure the server receives enough traffic, so we will configure a simple queue
with a limit-at parameter to guarantee a server receives 5Mbps:
```
/queue simple
add limit-at=5M/5M max-limit=15M/15M name=queue1 target=192.168.88.251/32
```
That is all. The server will get 5 Mbps of traffic rate regardless of other traffic flows. If you are using the default configuration, be sure the FastTrack rule is
disabled for this particular traffic, otherwise, it will bypass Simple Queues and they will not work.
Queue Tree
```
/queue tree
```
The queue tree creates only a one-directional queue in one of the HTBs. It is also the only way how to add a queue on a separate interface. This way it is
possible to ease mangle configuration - you don't need separate marks for download and upload - only the upload will get to the Public interface and only
the download will get to a Private interface. The main difference from Simple Queues is that the Queue tree is not ordered - all traffic passes it together.
Configuration example
In the following example, we will mark all the packets coming from preconfigured in-interface-list=LAN and will limit the traffic with a queue tree based on
these packet marks.
Let`s create a firewall address-list:
```

Mark packets with firewall mangle facility:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-packet chain=forward dst-address-list=Youtube in-interface-list=LAN new-packet-mark=pmark-
Youtube passthrough=yes
```
Configure the queue tree based on previously marked packets:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /queue tree
add max-limit=5M name=Limiting-Youtube packet-mark=pmark-Youtube parent=global
```
Check Queue tree stats to be sure traffic is matched:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > queue tree print stats

```
All MikroTik products have the default queue type "only-hardware-queue" with "kind=none". "only-hardware-queue" leaves the interface with only hardware
transmit descriptor ring buffer which acts as a queue in itself. Usually, at least 100 packets can be queued for transmit in the transmit descriptor ring buffer.
Transmit descriptor ring buffer size and the number of packets that can be queued in it varies for different types of ethernet MACs. Having no software
queue is especially beneficial on SMP systems because it removes the requirement to synchronize access to it from different CPUs/cores which is
resource-intensive. Having the possibility to set "only-hardware-queue" requires support in an ethernet driver so it is available only for some ethernet
interfaces mostly found on RouterBOARDs.
A "multi-queue-ethernet-default" can be beneficial on SMP systems with ethernet interfaces that have support for multiple transmit queues and have a
Linux driver support for multiple transmit queues. By having one software queue for each hardware queue there might be less time spent on synchronizing
access to them.
Kinds
Queue kinds are packet processing algorithms. Kind describe which packet will be transmitted next in the line. RouterOS supports the following Queueing
kinds:
```
FIFO (BFIFO, PFIFO, MQ PFIFO)
RED
SFQ
PCQ
```
FIFO
These kinds are based on the FIFO algorithm (First-In-First-Out). The difference between PFIFO and BFIFO is that one is measured in packets and the
other one in bytes. These queues use pfifo-limit and bfifo-limit parameters.
Every packet that cannot be enqueued (if the queue is full), is dropped. Large queue sizes can increase latency but utilize the channel better.
MQ-PFIFO is pfifo with support for multiple transmit queues. This queue is beneficial on SMP systems with ethernet interfaces that have support for
multiple transmit queues and have a Linux driver support for multiple transmit queues (mostly on x86 platforms). This kind uses the mq-pfifo-limit
parameter.
RED
```
Improvement from only-hardware-queue and multi-queue-ethernet-default is present only when there is no "/queue tree" entry with a particular
interface as a parent.
```
Random Early Drop is a queuing mechanism that tries to avoid network congestion by controlling the average queue size. The average queue size is
compared to two thresholds: a minimum (minth) and a maximum (maxth) threshold. If the average queue size (avgq) is less than the minimum threshold, no
packets are dropped. When the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold, all incoming packets are dropped. But if the average queue
size is between the minimum and maximum thresholds packets are randomly dropped with probability Pd where probability is exact a function of the
average queue size: Pd = Pmax(avgq – minth)/ (maxth - minth). If the average queue grows, the probability of dropping incoming packets grows too. Pmax -
ratio, which can adjust the packet discarding probability abruptness, (the simplest case Pmax can be equal to one. The 8.2 diagram shows the packet drop
probability in the RED algorithm.
SFQ
Stochastic Fairness Queuing (SFQ) is ensured by hashing and round-robin algorithms. SFQ is called "Stochastic" because it does not really allocate a
queue for each flow, it has an algorithm that divides traffic over a limited number of queues (1024) using a hashing algorithm.
Traffic flow may be uniquely identified by 4 options (src-address, dst-address, src-port, and dst-port), so these parameters are used by the SFQ hashing
algorithm to classify packets into one of 1024 possible sub-streams. Then round-robin algorithm will start to distribute available bandwidth to all sub-
streams, on each round giving sfq-allot bytes of traffic. The whole SFQ queue can contain 128 packets and there are 1024 sub-streams available. The 8.3
diagram shows the SFQ operation:
PCQ
PCQ algorithm is very simple - at first, it uses selected classifiers to distinguish one sub-stream from another, then applies individual FIFO queue size and
limitation on every sub-stream, then groups all sub-streams together and applies global queue size and limitation.
PCQ parameters:
```
pcq-classifier (dst-address | dst-port | src-address | src-port; default: "") : selection of sub-stream identifiers
pcq-rate (number): maximal available data rate of each sub-steam
pcq-limit (number): queue size of single sub-stream (in KiB)
pcq-total-limit (number): maximum amount of queued data in all sub-streams (in KiB)
```
It is possible to assign a speed limitation to sub-streams with the pcq-rate option. If "pcq-rate=0" sub-streams will divide available traffic equally.
For example, instead of having 100 queues with 1000kbps limitation for download, we can have one PCQ queue with 100 sub-streams
PCQ has burst implementation identical to Simple Queues and Queue Tree:
```
pcq-burst-rate (number): maximal upload/download data rate which can be reached while the burst for substream is allowed
pcq-burst-threshold (number): this is the value of burst on/off switch
pcq-burst-time (time): a period of time (in seconds) over which the average data rate is calculated. (This is NOT the time of the actual burst)
```
PCQ also allows using different size IPv4 and IPv6 networks as sub-stream identifiers. Before it was locked to a single IP address. This is done mainly for
IPv6 as customers from an ISP point of view will be represented by /64 network, but devices in customers network will be /128. PCQ can be used for both
of these scenarios and more. PCQ parameters:
```
pcq-dst-address-mask (number): the size of the IPv4 network that will be used as a dst-address sub-stream identifier
pcq-src-address-mask (number): the size of the IPv4 network that will be used as an src-address sub-stream identifier
pcq-dst-address6-mask (number): the size of the IPV6 network that will be used as a dst-address sub-stream identifier
pcq-src-address6-mask (number): the size of the IPV6 network that will be used as an src-address sub-stream identifier
```
CoDel
CoDel (Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management) algorithm uses the local minimum queue as a measure of the persistent queue, similarly, it uses a
minimum delay parameter as a measure of the standing queue delay. Queue size is calculated using packet residence time in the queue.
Properties
```
The following queue kinds CoDel, FQ-Codel, and CAKE available since RouterOS version 7.1beta3.
```
```
Property Description
```
```
codel-ce-threshold (default: ) Marks packets above a configured threshold with ECN.
```
```
codel-ecn (default: no) An option is used to mark packets instead of dropping them.
```
```
codel-interval (default: 100ms) Interval should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT through the bottleneck giving endpoints sufficient time to
react.
```
```
codel-limit (default: 1000 ) Queue limit, when the limit is reached, incoming packets are dropped.

FQ-Codel
CoDel - Fair Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel) uses a randomly determined model to classify incoming packets into different flows and is used
to provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the queue. Each flow is managed using CoDel queuing discipline which internally uses a FIFO
algorithm.

ms)
```
```

```
CAKE
CAKE - Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE) implemented as a queue discipline (qdisc) for the Linux kernel uses COBALT (AQM algorithm
combining Codel and BLUE) and a variant of DRR++ for flow isolation. In other words, Cake’s fundamental design goal is user-friendliness. All settings are
optional; the default settings are chosen to be practical in most common deployments. In most cases, the configuration requires only a bandwidth
parameter to get useful results,
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
cake-ack-filter (default: none )
```
```
cake-atm (default: ) Compensates for ATM cell framing, which is normally found on ADSL links.
```
```
cake-autorate-ingress (yes/no,
default: )
```
```
Automatic capacity estimation based on traffic arriving at this qdisc. This is most likely to be useful with cellular links,
which tend to change quality randomly.  The Bandwidth Limit parameter can be used in conjunction to specify an
initial estimate. The shaper will periodically be set to a bandwidth slightly below the estimated rate.  This estimator
cannot estimate the bandwidth of links downstream of itself.
```
```
cake-bandwidth (default: ) Sets the shaper bandwidth.
```
```
cake-diffserv (default: diffserv3) CAKE can divide traffic into "tins" based on the Diffserv field:
```
```
diffserv4 Provides a general-purpose Diffserv implementation with four tins: Bulk (CS1), 6.25% threshold,
generally low priority. Best Effort (general), 100% threshold. Video (AF4x, AF3x, CS3, AF2x, CS2, TOS4,
TOS1), 50% threshold. Voice (CS7, CS6, EF, VA, CS5, CS4), 25% threshold.
diffserv3 (default) Provides a simple, general-purpose Diffserv implementation with three tins: Bulk (CS1),
6.25% threshold, generally low priority. Best Effort (general), 100% threshold. Voice (CS7, CS6, EF, VA,
TOS4), 25% threshold, reduced Codel interval.
```
```
cake-flowmode (dsthost/dual-
dsthost/dual-srchost/flowblind
/flows/hosts/srchost/triple-
isolate, default: triple-isolate)
```
```
flowblind - Disables flow isolation; all traffic passes through a single queue for each tin.
srchost - Flows are defined only by source address.
dsthost Flows are defined only by destination address.
hosts - Flows are defined by source-destination host pairs. This is host isolation, rather than flow isolation.
flows - Flows are defined by the entire 5-tuple of source address, a destination address, transport protocol,
source port, and destination port. This is the type of flow isolation performed by SFQ and fq_codel.
dual-srchost Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over source addresses, then over
individual flows. Good for use on egress traffic from a LAN to the internet, where it'll prevent any LAN host from
monopolizing the uplink, regardless of the number of flows they use.
dual-dsthost Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over destination addresses, then over
individual flows. Good for use on ingress traffic to a LAN from the internet, where it'll prevent any LAN host from
monopolizing the downlink, regardless of the number of flows they use.
triple-isolate - Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied over source *and* destination addresses
intelligently (ie. not merely by host-pairs), and also over individual flows.
nat Instructs Cake to perform a NAT lookup before applying flow- isolation rules, to determine the true addresses
and port numbers of the packet, to improve fairness between hosts "inside" the NAT. This has no practical effect
in "flowblind" or "flows" modes, or if NAT is performed on a different host.
nonat (default) The cake will not perform a NAT lookup. Flow isolation will be performed using the addresses
and port numbers directly visible to the interface Cake is attached to.
```
```
cake-memlimit (default: ) Limit the memory consumed by Cake to LIMIT bytes. By default, the limit is calculated based on the bandwidth and
RTT settings.
```
```
cake-mpu ( -64 ... 256, default: ) Rounds each packet (including overhead) up to a minimum length BYTES.
```
```
cake-nat (default: no) Instructs Cake to perform a NAT lookup before applying a flow-isolation rule.
```
```
cake-overhead ( -64 ... 256,
default: )
```
```
Adds BYTES to the size of each packet. BYTES may be negative.
```
```
cake-overhead-scheme (default:
)
```
```
cake-rtt (default: 100ms ) Manually specify an RTT. Default 100ms is suitable for most Internet traffic.
```
```
cake-rtt-scheme (datacentre
/internet/interplanetary/lan
/metro/none/oceanic/regional
/satellite, default: )
```
```
datacentre - For extremely high-performance 10GigE+ networks only. Equivalent to RTT 100us.
lan - For pure Ethernet (not Wi-Fi) networks, at home or in the office. Don't use this when shaping for an Internet
access link. Equivalent to RTT 1ms.
metro - For traffic mostly within a single city. Equivalent to RTT 10ms. regional For traffic mostly within a
European-sized country. Equivalent to RTT 30ms.
internet (default) This is suitable for most Internet traffic. Equivalent to RTT 100ms.
oceanic - For Internet traffic with generally above-average latency, such as that suffered by Australasian
residents. Equivalent to RTT 300ms.
satellite - For traffic via geostationary satellites. Equivalent to RTT 1000ms.
interplanetary - So named because Jupiter is about 1 light-hour from Earth. Use this to (almost) completely
disable AQM actions. Equivalent to RTT 3600s.
```
```
cake-wash (default: no ) Apply the wash option to clear all extra DiffServ (but not ECN bits), after priority queuing has taken place.
```
Interface Queue
```
/queue interface
```
Before sending data over an interface, it is processed by the queue. This sub-menu lists all available interfaces in RouterOS and allows to change queue
type for a particular interface. The list is generated automatically.

## Introduction
HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) is a classful queuing method that is useful for handling different kinds of traffic.  This article will concentrate on the
"Token Bucket" part of Hierarchical Token Bucket(HTB) - an algorithm inside the single queue and configuration examples.

## Token Bucket algorithm (Red part of the diagram)
The Token Bucket algorithm is based on an analogy to a bucket where tokens, represented in bytes, are added at a specific rate. The bucket itself has a
specified capacity.
If the bucket fills to capacity, newly arriving tokens are dropped
Bucket capacity = bucket-size * max-limit
```
bucket size (0..10, Default:0.1) - queue option was added in RouterOS v6.35, before that it was hard-coded to a value of "0.1".
```
Before allowing any packet to pass through the queue, the queue bucket is inspected to see if it already contains sufficient tokens at that moment.
If yes, the appropriate number of tokens are removed ("cashed in") and the packet is permitted to pass through the queue.
If not, the packets stay at the start of the packet waiting queue until the appropriate amount of tokens is available.
In the case of a multi-level queue structure, tokens used in a child queue are also 'charged' to their parent queues. In other words - child queues 'borrow'
tokens from their parent queues.

## Packet queue (Blue part of the diagram)
The size of this packet queue, the sequence, how packets are added to this queue, and when packets are discarded is determined by:
```
queue-type - Queue
queue-size - Queue Size
```

## Token rate selection (Black part of the diagram)
The maximal token rate at any given time is equal to the highest activity of these values:
```
limit-at (NUMBER/NUMBER): guaranteed upload/download data rate to a target
max-limit (NUMBER/NUMBER): maximal upload/download data rate that is allowed for a target
burst-limit (NUMBER/NUMBER): maximal upload/download data rate that is allowed for a target while the 'burst' is active
```
burst-limit is active only when 'burst' is in the allowed state - more info here: Queue Burst
In a case where limit-at is the highest value, extra tokens need to be issued to compensate for all missing tokens that were not borrowed from its parent
queue.
The Diagram
Bucket Size in action
Let's have a simple setup where all traffic from and to one IP address is marked with a packet-mark:
```
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-mark=no-mark src-address=192.168.88.101 new-connection-
mark=pc1_conn
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-mark=no-mark dst-address=192.168.88.101 new-connection-
mark=pc1_conn
add chain=forward action=mark-packet connection-mark=pc1_conn new-packet-mark=pc1_traffic
```
Default Queue Bucket
```
/queue tree
add name=download parent=Local packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M
add name=upload parent=Public packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M
```
In this case bucket-size=0.1, so bucket-capacity= 0.1 x 10M = 1M
If the bucket is full (that is, the client was not using the full capacity of the queue for some time), the next 1Mb of traffic can pass through the queue at an
unrestricted speed.
Large Queue Bucket
```
/queue tree
add name=download parent=Local packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M bucket-size=10
add name=upload parent=Public packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M bucket-size=10
```
Let's try to apply the same logic to a situation when bucket size is at its maximal value:
In this case bucket-size=10, so bucket-capacity= 10 x 10M = 100M
If the bucket is full (that is, the client was not using the full capacity of the queue for some time), the next 100Mb of traffic can pass through the queue at an
unrestricted speed.
So you can have:
```
20Mbps transfer speed for 10s
60Mbps transfer burst for 2s
1Gbps transfer burst for approximately 100ms
```
You can therefore see that the bucket permits a type of 'burstiness' of the traffic that passes through the queue. The behavior is similar to the normal burst
feature but lacks the upper limit of the burst. This setback can be avoided if we utilize bucket size in the queue structure:
Large Child Queue Bucket, Small Parent Queue Bucket
```
/queue tree
add name=download_parent parent=Local max-limit=20M
add name=download parent=download_parent packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M bucket-size=10
add name=upload_parent parent=Public max-limit=20M
add name=upload parent=upload_parent packet-mark=PC1-traffic max-limit=10M bucket-size=10
```
In this case:
```
parent queue bucket-size=0.1, bucket-capacity= 0.1 x 20M = 2M
child queue bucket-size=10, bucket-capacity= 10 x 10M = 100M
```
The parent will run out of tokens much faster than the child queue and as its child queue always borrows tokens from the parent queue the whole system is
restricted to token-rate of the parent queue - in this case to max-limit=20M. This rate will be sustained until the child queue runs out of tokens and will be
restricted to its token rate of 10Mbps.
In this way, we can have a burst at 20Mbps for up to 10 seconds.
Configuration
We have to follow three basic steps to create HTB:
```
Match and mark traffic – classify traffic for further use. Consists of one or more matching parameters to select packets for the specific class;
Create rules (policy) to mark traffic – put specific traffic classes into specific queues and define the actions that are taken for each class;
Attach a policy for specific interface(-s) – append policy for all interfaces (global-in, global-out, or global-total), for a specific interface, or for a
specific parent queue;
```
HTB allows to create of a hierarchical queue structure and determines relations between queues, like "parent-child" or "child-child".
As soon as the queue has at least one child it becomes an inner queue, all queues without children - are leaf queues. Leaf queues make actual traffic
consumption, Inner queues are responsible only for traffic distribution. All leaf queues are treated on an equal basis.
In RouterOS, it is necessary to specify the parent option to assign a queue as a child to another queue.
Dual Limitation
Each queue in HTB has two rate limits:
```
CIR (Committed Information Rate) – (limit-at in RouterOS) worst case scenario, the flow will get this amount of traffic no matter what (assuming
we can actually send so much data);
MIR (Maximal Information Rate) – (max-limit in RouterOS) best case scenario, a rate that flow can get up to if their queue's parent has spare
bandwidth;
```
In other words, at first limit-at (CIR) of all queues will be satisfied, only then child queues will try to borrow the necessary data rate from their parents in
order to reach their max-limit (MIR).
That is why, to ensure optimal (as designed) usage of the dual limitation feature, we suggest sticking to these rules:
```
The Sum of committed rates of all children must be less or equal to the amount of traffic that is available to parents;
```
CIR(parent)* ≥ CIR(child1) +...+ CIR(childN)*in case if parent is main parent CIR(parent)=MIR(parent)
```
The maximal rate of any child must be less or equal to the maximal rate of the parent
```
MIR (parent) ≥ MIR(child1) & MIR (parent) ≥ MIR(child2) & ... & MIR (parent) ≥ MIR(childN)
Queue colors in Winbox:
```
0% - 50% available traffic used - green
51% - 75% available traffic used - yellow
76% - 100% available traffic used - red
```
Priority
We already know that limit-at (CIR) to all queues will be given out no matter what.
Priority is responsible for the distribution of remaining parent queues traffic to child queues so that they are able to reach max-limit
The queue with higher priority will reach its max-limit before the queue with lower priority. 8 is the lowest priority, and 1 is the highest.
Make a note that priority only works:
```
for leaf queues - priority in the inner queue has no meaning.
if max-limit is specified (not 0)
```
Examples
In this section, we will analyze HTB in action. To do that we will take one HTB structure and will try to cover all the possible situations and features, by
changing the amount of incoming traffic that HTB has to recycle. and changing some options.
Structure
Our HTB structure will consist of 5 queues:
```
Queue01 inner queue with two children - Queue02 and Queue03
Queue02 inner queue with two children - Queue04 and Queue05
Queue03 leaf queue
Queue04 leaf queue
Queue05 leaf queue
```
Queue03, Queue04, and Queue05 are clients who require 10Mbps all the time Outgoing interface is able to handle 10Mbps of traffic.
Example 1: Usual case
```
CIR will be assigned to the corresponding queue no matter what. (even if max-limit of the parent is exceeded)
```
```
Queue01 limit-at=0Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue02 limit-at=4Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue03 limit-at=6Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=1
Queue04 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=3
Queue05 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=5
```
Result of Example 1
```
Queue03 will receive 6Mbps
Queue04 will receive 2Mbps
Queue05 will receive 2Mbps
Clarification: HTB was built in a way, that, by satisfying all limit-ats, the main queue no longer has throughput to distribute.
```
Example 2: Usual case with max-limit
```
Queue01 limit-at=0Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue02 limit-at=4Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue03 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=3
Queue04 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=1
Queue05 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=5
```
Result of Example 2
```
Queue03 will receive 2Mbps
Queue04 will receive 6Mbps
Queue05 will receive 2Mbps
Clarification: After satisfying all limit-ats HTB will give throughput to the queue with the highest priority.
```
Example 3: Inner queue limit-at
```
Queue01 limit-at=0Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue02 limit-at=8Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue03 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=1
Queue04 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=3
Queue05 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=5
```
Result of Example 3
```
Queue03 will receive 2Mbps
Queue04 will receive 6Mbps
Queue05 will receive 2Mbps
Clarification: After satisfying all limit-ats HTB will give throughput to the queue with the highest priority. But in this case, inner queue Queue02 had l
imit-at specified, by doing so, it reserved 8Mbps of throughput for queues Queue04 and Queue05. Of these two Queue04 has the highest priority,
which is why it gets additional throughput.
```
Example 4: Leaf queue limit-at
```
Queue01 limit-at=0Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue02 limit-at=4Mbps max-limit=10Mbps
Queue03 limit-at=6Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=1
Queue04 limit-at=2Mbps max-limit=10Mbps priority=3
Queue05 limit-at=12Mbps max-limit=15Mbps priority=5
```
Result of Example 4
```
Queue03 will receive ~3Mbps
Queue04 will receive ~1Mbps
Queue05 will receive ~6Mbps
Clarification: Only by satisfying all limit-ats HTB was forced to allocate 20Mbps - 6Mbps to Queue03, 2Mbps to Queue04, and 12Mbps to Queue05
, but our output interface is able to handle 10Mbps. As the output interface queue is usually FIFO throughput allocation will keep the ratio 6:2:12
or 3:1:6
```


# Queue size
```
Example
100% Shaper
100% Scheduler
Default-small queue type
Default queue type
```

## Example
This example was created to highlight the queue size impact on traffic that was queued by a specific queue.
In Mikrotik RouterOS, queue size can be specified in the "/queue type" menu. Each queue type has a different option for specifying queue size (pfifo-
limit, bfifo-limit, pcq-limit, pcq-total-limit, red-limit), but all principles are the same - queue size is the main option that decides should the package be
dropped or scheduled for a later time.
In a real-time environment, this process is happening continuously without any stops, steps, or other interruptions, but to show it as an example, we will
divide it into steps, where it is possible to know exactly how many packets will be received/transited in every step.
We will not go into specific details of TCP and dropped packet retransmission - consider these packets as simple UDP streams.
As you can see in the picture above there are 25 steps and there are a total of 1610 incoming packets over this time frame.

## 100% Shaper
A queue is 100% shaper when every packet that is over the allowed limits will be dropped immediately. This way all packages that are not dropped will be
sent out without any delay.
Let's apply max-limit=100 packets per step limitation to our example:
With this type of limitation, only 1250 out of 1610 packets were able to pass the queue (22,4% packet drop), but all packets arrive without delay.
100% Scheduler
A queue is 100% Scheduler when there are no packet drops at all, all packets are queued and will be sent out at the first possible moment.
In each step, the queue must send out queued packets from previous steps first and only then send out packets from this step, this way it is possible to
keep the right sequence of packets.
We will again use the same limit (100 packets per step).
There was no packet loss, but 630 (39,1%) packets had 1 step delay, and the other 170 (10,6%) packets had 2 step delay. (delay = latency)
Default-small queue type
It is also possible to choose the middle way when the queue uses both of these queuing aspects (shaping and scheduling). By default, most of the queues
in RouterOS have a queue size of 10.
There were 320 (19,9%) packets dropped and 80 (5,0%) packets had 1 step delay.
Default queue type
Another popular queue size in RouterOS is 50.
There were 190 (11,8%) packets dropped and 400 (24,8%) packets had 1 step delay.

# Queue Burst
```
Introduction
Example
Burst-time=16s
Burst-time=8s
```

## Introduction
Burst is a feature that allows satisfying queue requirements for additional bandwidth even if the required rate is bigger than MIR (max-limit) for a limited
period of time.
Burst can occur only if average-rate of the queue for the last burst-time seconds is smaller than burst-threshold. Burst will stop if average-rate of the queue
for the last burst-time seconds is bigger or equal to burst-threshold.
The burst mechanism is simple - if a burst is allowed max-limit value is replaced by the burst-limit value. When the burst is disallowed max-limit value
remains unchanged.
```
burst-limit (NUMBER) : maximal upload/download data rate which can be reached while the burst is allowed;
burst-time (TIME) : period of time, in seconds, over which the average data rate is calculated. (This is NOT the time of actual burst);
burst-threshold (NUMBER) : this is value of burst on/off switch;
average-rate (read-only) : Every 1/16 part of the burst-time, the router calculates the average data rate of each class over the last burst-time secon
ds;
actual-rate (read-only) : actual traffic transfer rate of the queue;
```

## Example
Values: limit-at=1M , max-limit=2M , burst-threshold=1500k , burst-limit=4M
The client will try to download two 4MB (32Mb) blocks of data, the first download will start at zero seconds, and the second download will start at 17th
second. Traffic was unused at the last minute.

## Burst-time=16s
As we can see as soon as the client requested bandwidth it was able to get 4Mpbs burst for 6 seconds. This is longest possible burst with given values (lon
gest-burst-time = burst-threshold * burst-time / burst-limit). As soon as the burst runs out rest of the data will be downloaded with 2Mbps. This way block of
data was downloaded in 9 seconds - without burst, it would take 16 seconds. Burst has 7 seconds to recharge before the next download will start.
Note that burst is still disallowed when download started and it kicks in only afterward - in the middle of a download. So with this example, we proved that a
burst may happen in the middle of a download. The burst was ~4 seconds long and the second block was downloaded 4 seconds faster than without burst.
The average rate is calculated every 1/16 of burst time so in this case 1s
```

# PCQ example
Per Connection Queue (PCQ) is a queuing discipline that can be used to dynamically equalize or shape traffic for multiple users, using little administration.
It is possible to divide PCQ scenarios into three major groups: equal bandwidth for a number of users, certain bandwidth equal distribution between users,
and unknown bandwidth equal distribution between users.

## Equal Bandwidth for a Number of Users
Use PCQ type queue when you need to equalize the bandwidth [and set max limit] for a number of users. We will set the 64kbps download and 32kbps
upload limits.
There are two ways how to make this: using mangle and queue trees, or, using simple queues.
1. Mark all packets with packet-marks upload/download: (let's consider that ether1-WAN is the public interface to the Internet and ether2-LAN is a local
interface where clients are connected):
```
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-packet \
in-interface=ether2-LAN new-packet-mark=client_upload
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-packet \
in-interface=ether1-WAN new-packet-mark=client_download
```
2. Set up two PCQ queue types - one for download and one for upload. dst-address is a classifier for the user's download traffic, and src-address for
upload traffic:
```
/queue type add name="PCQ_download" kind=pcq pcq-rate=64000 pcq-classifier=dst-address
/queue type add name="PCQ_upload" kind=pcq pcq-rate=32000 pcq-classifier=src-address
```
3. Finally, two queue rules are required, one for download and one for upload:
```
/queue tree add parent=global queue=PCQ_download packet-mark=client_download
/queue tree add parent=global queue=PCQ_upload packet-mark=client_upload
```
If you don't like using mangle and queue trees, you can skip step 1, do step 2, and step 3 would be to create one simple queue as shown here:
```
/queue simple add target=192.168.0.0/24 queue=PCQ_upload/PCQ_download
```

# Queue types

## Overview 
Queue type (also known as a queuing discipline) refers to the policy by which various data packets are managed in a network queue.
This policy determines which packet to send next from the queue when a data transmission has been completed. The queue type impacts how the network
handles data traffic, which in turn affects factors such as the distribution of bandwidth among different flows, latency, and the handling of congestion.
Queue types can be simple or complex, and different types have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, a First In, First Out (FIFO) queue is
simple and ensures fairness in the order of packet processing, but it can lead to issues such as head-of-line blocking. More complex queue types, such as
those that implement fair queuing or congestion avoidance, can help manage network performance more effectively, but they may require more resources
and configuration.
Therefore, the choice of queue type depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the network.

## Queue type introduction
```
BFIFO (Byte-oriented First In, First Out):
```
```
Features: BFIFO is a simple byte-oriented queuing discipline that sends out packets in the order they arrived and based on their size.
Advantages: Simplicity and fairness in packet management.
Disadvantages: BFIFO can lead to head-of-line blocking, where a large packet can delay all the smaller packets behind it. Also, there is
no mechanism to prevent congestion or prioritize packets.
PFIFO (Packet-oriented First In, First Out):
```
```
Features: Like BFIFO but operates on a packet basis rather than bytes.
Advantages: Easy to implement and understand. It's fair in terms of packet numbers.
Disadvantages: Like BFIFO, it suffers from head-of-line blocking and doesn't have any congestion management mechanism.
CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced):
```
```
Features: A comprehensive queue management system designed to combat bufferbloat and ensure fair queuing. It combines CoDel,
FQ, and other technologies.
Advantages: Excellent at managing latency under any network condition. It's particularly useful in consumer broadband connections.
Disadvantages: More complex to configure than simpler queuing disciplines. Not ideal for all use cases, particularly where fine-tuned
control is required.
CoDel (Controlled Delay):
```
```
Features: CoDel aims to improve bufferbloat by dropping packets to control queue delay.
Advantages: Good at managing latency and avoiding bufferbloat.
Disadvantages: CoDel on its own does not provide fair queuing.
FQ_CoDel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay):
```
```
Features: Combines the latency management of CoDel with fair queuing.
Advantages: Excellent latency management and fair distribution of bandwidth among flows. Generally considered a good default choice.
Disadvantages: More complex than simpler queue disciplines, which can make it harder to configure.
MQ_PFIFO (Multiqueue Packet First In, First Out):
```
```
Features: MQ_PFIFO is an extension of PFIFO that supports multiple queues.
Advantages: Allows different queues for different types or priorities of traffic.
Disadvantages: Still suffers from head-of-line blocking and lacks a built-in congestion management mechanism.
RED (Random Early Detection):
```
```
Features: RED aims to anticipate and prevent congestion by randomly dropping packets before the queue becomes full.
Advantages: Helps to prevent congestion and can improve overall network performance.
Disadvantages: Configuration can be complex and needs to be tuned for the network's specific characteristics. Misconfiguration can lead
to reduced performance.
SFQ (Stochastic Fairness Queuing):
```
```
Features: SFQ aims to ensure a fair distribution of resources among flows by assigning them to different dynamic queues.
Advantages: Helps to prevent a single flow from dominating the connection.
Disadvantages: SFQ does not manage latency or congestion. The number of queues can also increase memory usage.
```
In choosing a queue discipline, you'll need to consider the characteristics of your network and what you prioritize most, such as latency, fairness, simplicity,
or congestion management.


# CAKE

## CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced)

## Description:
CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced) is a modern, advanced queue management algorithm designed to cope with varying network conditions and
different types of traffic. It was developed to address the limitations of older algorithms and provide an all-in-one solution to several common network
problems.
CAKE's approach is to maintain fairness, minimize bufferbloat, and manage different types of traffic with minimal configuration and tuning. This is achieved
through various techniques including flow isolation, bandwidth shaping, and prioritization of small packets.
```
Property Description
```
```
Bandwith
Limit:
```
```
This allows you to manually set the bandwidth limit for the CAKE shaper. For instance, if you're aware that your ISP provides you with a
100Mbps connection, you could set the rate to 100Mbps to prevent CAKE from trying to use more bandwidth than available.
```
```
Autorate
Ingress
```
```
This is useful in situations where the connection quality varies. For example, if you're on a cellular data connection that can fluctuate wildly
based on signal strength, this option allows CAKE to adjust the shaper bandwidth dynamically to match the estimated capacity of the link.
```
```
Overhead The overhead parameter in the CAKE queue discipline allows you to specify the per-packet overhead (in bytes) to account for when
shaping traffic. This is particularly important when dealing with technologies such as DSL, where protocol encapsulation adds additional
bytes to each packet. Accurately accounting for these overheads will lead to more precise control of the actual bandwidth being used.
```
```
MPU The Minimum Packet Unit (MPU) parameter allows you to round up the size of each packet to a specified minimum. This is useful for link
layer technologies that have a minimum packet size. For example, if your link layer technology has a minimum packet size of 64 bytes, you
can configure CAKE with mpu 64.
```
```
ATM This is for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a type of network technology often used in DSL broadband connections. ATM uses fixed 53-byte
cells, each of which can carry 48 bytes of payload. The atm keyword compensates for this overhead.
```
```
Overhead
Scheme
```
```
The overhead compensation feature in CAKE allows it to account for the extra bytes added by various link layer technologies, which can be
significant in some cases. This is important because CAKE operates on the packet sizes reported by the Linux kernel, which do not include
these extra bytes. If the overhead is not accounted for, CAKE's shaper might allow more data onto the link than it can actually handle,
leading to unexpected packet loss.
```
```
RTT Manually specify an RTT. This is for advanced users who know the exact RTT they want to use.
```
```
RTT
Scheme
```
```
The CAKE queue discipline allows you to specify the Round Trip Time (RTT) it should consider when managing traffic. This is important
because the time it takes for a packet to travel from a source to a destination and back impacts how CAKE manages network congestion. If
the actual RTT of your network is close to the value you specify, both the throughput and latency of your network should be well managed.
```
```
Diffserv Diffserv (Differentiated Services) is a mechanism used to prioritize and classify network traffic based on the Diffserv field in the IP packet
header. CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced) provides Diffserv support, allowing traffic to be divided into "tins" (traffic classes)
and applying different treatment to each tin.
```
```
Flow
Mode
```
```
When flow isolation is enabled, CAKE puts packets from different flows into different queues. Each queue maintains its own Active Queue
Management (AQM) state, and packets are delivered from each queue fairly using a DRR++ (Deficit Round Robin++) algorithm. This
algorithm works to minimize latency for "sparse" flows, or flows that contain fewer packets.
```
```
ACK Filter ACK or acknowledgment filters are a feature of the Cake algorithm that allows for the handling of TCP ACK (acknowledgment) packets.
TCP ACK packets are essential to the function of the TCP protocol; they acknowledge the receipt of TCP segments, providing a form of
flow control. However, these packets can consume a significant portion of your upload bandwidth, especially when downloading large files.
By implementing ACK filtering, Cake can compress these ACKs, reducing their impact on upload bandwidth.
```
```
NAT These options control how CAKE handles traffic when Network Address Translation (NAT) is being used. nat makes CAKE consider the
post-NAT addresses and ports when isolating flows, which can be useful when you're shaping traffic on a router that is also performing
NAT for its connected devices.
```
```
Wash The "wash" option in the CAKE queue discipline is used to address the issue of frequently mis-marked traffic entering or exiting a DiffServ
(Differentiated Services) domain. When traffic passes through networks or providers, there is a chance that the DSCP (Differentiated
Services Code Point) markings could be modified or incorrectly assigned.

Overhead Schemes
The overhead compensation feature in CAKE allows it to account for the extra bytes added by various link layer technologies, which can be significant in
some cases. This is important because CAKE operates on the packet sizes reported by the Linux kernel, which do not include these extra bytes. If the
overhead is not accounted for, CAKE's shaper might allow more data onto the link than it can actually handle, leading to unexpected packet loss.
```
Manual Overhead Specification: You can manually specify the overhead in bytes. For instance, if you know your link layer adds 18 bytes of
overhead to each packet, you can configure CAKE with overhead 18. Negative values are also accepted, within a range of -64 to 256 bytes.
MPU: The Minimum Packet Unit (MPU) parameter allows you to round up the size of each packet to a specified minimum. This is useful for link
layer technologies that have a minimum packet size. For example, if your link layer technology has a minimum packet size of 64 bytes, you can
configure CAKE with mpu 64.
ATM: This is for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a type of network technology often used in DSL broadband connections. ATM uses fixed 53-byte
cells, each of which can carry 48 bytes of payload. The atm keyword compensates for this overhead.
PTM: This is for Packet Transfer Mode, another network technology often used in VDSL2 connections. PTM uses a 64b/65b encoding scheme,
which effectively reduces the usable bandwidth by a small amount. The ptm keyword compensates for this overhead.
Failsafe Overhead Keywords: The raw and conservative keywords are provided for quick-and-dirty setup. raw turns off all overhead
compensation in CAKE, and conservative compensates for more overhead than is likely to occur on any widely-deployed link technology.
ADSL Overhead Keywords: Most ADSL modems use ATM cell framing and have additional overhead due to the PPPoA or PPPoE protocol used.
Keywords such as pppoa-vcmux, pppoe-llc, etc. are provided to account for these overheads.
VDSL2 Overhead Keywords: VDSL2 uses PTM instead of ATM and may also use PPPoE. Keywords such as pppoe-ptm and bridged-ptm are
provided to account for these overheads.
DOCSIS Cable Overhead Keyword: DOCSIS is the standard for providing Internet service over cable-TV infrastructure. The docsis keyword is
provided to account for the overhead of DOCSIS.
Ethernet Overhead Keywords: These keywords account for the overhead of Ethernet frames, including the preamble, inter-frame gap, and Frame
Check Sequence. ethernet and ether-vlan are provided for Ethernet and Ethernet with VLAN respectively​^1 ​.
```
RTT Schemes
The CAKE queue discipline allows you to specify the Round Trip Time (RTT) it should consider when managing traffic. This is important because the time
it takes for a packet to travel from a source to a destination and back impacts how CAKE manages network congestion. If the actual RTT of your network is
close to the value you specify, both the throughput and latency of your network should be well managed.
Here are the RTT settings you can use, what they mean, and when you might use them:
```
rtt TIME: Manually specify an RTT. This is for advanced users who know the exact RTT they want to use.
datacentre: This is for extremely high-performance networks, such as a 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GigE) network in a data center. The RTT is
assumed to be 100 microseconds. Example: Use this if you're managing network traffic in a high-capacity data center.
lan: This is for pure Ethernet networks, such as those you might find in a home or office environment. The RTT is assumed to be 1 millisecond.
Example: Use this if you're managing traffic on a wired home or office network, but not when shaping for an Internet access link.
metro: This is for traffic mostly within a single city. The RTT is assumed to be 10 milliseconds. Example: Use this if you're managing traffic for a
network in a single city, like a city-wide corporate network.
regional: This is for traffic mostly within a European-sized country. The RTT is assumed to be 30 milliseconds. Example: Use this if you're
managing traffic for a network that spans a country.
internet: This is suitable for most Internet traffic. The RTT is assumed to be 100 milliseconds. Example: Use this if you're managing general
Internet traffic on a typical broadband connection.
oceanic: This is for Internet traffic with generally above-average latency, such as that suffered by Australasian residents. The RTT is assumed to
be 300 milliseconds. Example: Use this if you're managing traffic in a location with high latency, like Australia or New Zealand.
satellite: This is for traffic via geostationary satellites. The RTT is assumed to be 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Example: Use this if you're
managing traffic for a network that uses a satellite internet connection.
interplanetary: This disables Active Queue Management (AQM) actions, because the RTT is so long (3600 seconds). It's named
"interplanetary" because the distance from Earth to Jupiter is about one light-hour. Example: This is not typically used in standard networking
situations, but might be useful in extremely high latency situations, such as experimental long-distance communication scenarios.
```
Remember, these are guidelines, and the best setting depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of your network. If you are unsure, the int
ernet setting is a good starting point for most scenarios​^1 ​.
FLOW ISOLATION PARAMETER
When flow isolation is enabled, CAKE puts packets from different flows into different queues. Each queue maintains its own Active Queue Management
(AQM) state, and packets are delivered from each queue fairly using a DRR++ (Deficit Round Robin++) algorithm. This algorithm works to minimize
latency for "sparse" flows, or flows that contain fewer packets.

The key aspect here is the method by which CAKE determines different flows, known as "flow isolation." CAKE uses a set-associative hashing algorithm to
reduce flow collisions.
```
flowblind - This parameter disables flow isolation, and all traffic goes through a single queue for each 'tin' or traffic class. Useful in scenarios
where specific flow isolation is not needed or desired, such as when you want to process all traffic the same way regardless of source or
destination.
srchost - Here, flows are determined solely by the source address. This could be beneficial on the outgoing path of an Internet Service Provider
(ISP) backhaul. A telecom company might use this to ensure fair use of its backbone network by different regions or customers.
dsthost - With this parameter, flows are characterized only by their destination address. This might be beneficial on the incoming path of an ISP
backhaul. An enterprise could use this to balance incoming traffic to its different servers.
hosts - In this case, flows are defined by source-destination host pairs. This is host isolation rather than flow isolation. This might be useful in a
data center network, where you want to ensure that communication between specific pairs of servers is fair.
flows - Flows are characterized by the entire 5-tuple: source address, destination address, transport protocol, source port, and destination port.
This is the kind of flow isolation performed by SFQ and fq_codel. This could be used by a cloud provider to ensure fairness among different virtual
machines communicating over various protocols and ports.
dual-srchost - Here, flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over source addresses, then over individual flows. This is a good
choice for outgoing traffic from a Local Area Network (LAN) to the Internet. A university might use this to prevent any single user or device from
hogging the internet connection, no matter how many different connections they're using.
dual-dsthost - In this case, flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over destination addresses, then over individual flows.
This is suitable for incoming traffic to a LAN from the internet. A large company could use this to prevent any single server or system from
overwhelming the network's incoming bandwidth.
triple-isolate - This is the default setting where flows are defined by the 5-tuple. Fairness is applied over both source and destination addresses
intelligently, as well as over individual flows. This prevents any one host on either side of the link from monopolizing it with a large number of flows.
A Internet Service Provider (ISP) might use this to ensure fair service to all its customers, regardless of how many connections they have and
whether they
```
Ack Filter
ACK or acknowledgement filters are a feature of the Cake algorithm that allows for the handling of TCP ACK (acknowledgment) packets. TCP ACK
packets are essential to the function of the TCP protocol; they acknowledge the receipt of TCP segments, providing a form of flow control. However, these
packets can consume a significant portion of your upload bandwidth, especially when downloading large files. By implementing ACK filtering, Cake can
compress these ACKs, reducing their impact on upload bandwidth.
```
ack-filter - This enables the ACK filter feature. With this option, Cake will attempt to identify and filter out ACK packets that do not convey
significant new information or do not need to be sent immediately, helping to improve the utilization of the upload bandwidth.
ack-filter-aggressive - This is a more aggressive version of the ack-filter option. It will result in more ACK packets being compressed or filtered
out, which can lead to further improvements in upload bandwidth utilization but may potentially impact TCP performance.The use of the ack-filter
or ack-filter-aggressive options depends on your specific network conditions and requirements. For instance, if you find that ACK packets are
using a large portion of your available upload bandwidth, then enabling the ACK filter might help. On the other hand, if you're experiencing issues
with TCP performance and suspect that ACK filtering might be contributing, you could try disabling it or using the less aggressive option.
```
Wash
The "wash" option in the CAKE queue discipline is used to address the issue of frequently mis-marked traffic entering or exiting a DiffServ (Differentiated
Services) domain. When traffic passes through networks or providers, there is a chance that the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) markings
could be modified or incorrectly assigned.
To illustrate this with a real-life example and analogy:
Let's imagine you are running a busy airport. Different airlines have assigned different priority levels to their passengers based on their ticket classes
(economy, business, first-class). These priority levels are analogous to the DSCP markings in a network.
However, as passengers move through various transit airports, there is a possibility that the assigned priority levels could be changed or mis-marked due
to different airline policies or inconsistencies at the transit airports. This is similar to the mis-marking of traffic in transit networks.
Now, in the context of the airport, let's assume that upon arrival at your airport, passengers are divided into separate queues based on their priority levels.
This division ensures that passengers in higher-priority classes are processed more quickly and receive better service.
However, because the priority levels assigned at previous airports may not be reliable, it becomes necessary to "wash" or clear the assigned priority levels
before the passengers enter the queues at your airport. This is similar to the "wash" option in CAKE, which clears extra DSCP markings after priority
queuing has taken place.

In situations where inbound traffic's DSCP markings cannot be trusted (similar to cases like Comcast Cable), it is recommended to use a single queue
"besteffort" mode with the "wash" option. This means that all incoming traffic is treated as the default "best effort" class, and any potentially unreliable or
mis-marked DSCP values are cleared before further processing.
In our airport analogy, using a single queue "besteffort" mode with "wash" would mean that regardless of the priority assigned at previous airports, all
passengers are initially treated as standard passengers (best effort class) until their priority can be accurately determined and assigned at your airport.
This approach ensures that even if the DSCP markings of incoming traffic have been mis-marked or modified during transit, the traffic is treated fairly and
uniformly within your network, without relying on potentially unreliable markings from external sources.
By applying the "wash" option in CAKE, network administrators can mitigate the impact of mis-marked or modified DSCP markings, providing a more
consistent and reliable Quality of Service (QoS) treatment within their network domain.
Diffserv RFC2474 and RFC2475
Diffserv (Differentiated Services) is a mechanism used to prioritize and classify network traffic based on the Diffserv field in the IP packet header. CAKE
(Common Applications Kept Enhanced) provides Diffserv support, allowing traffic to be divided into "tins" (traffic classes) and applying different treatment
to each tin. Here's a breakdown of the Diffserv presets in CAKE along with real-world examples:
besteffort -The "besteffort" preset in CAKE disables priority queuing and places all traffic into a single tin. This means that all traffic is treated equally
without any specific prioritization. This preset can be suitable for non-critical or low-priority traffic, such as general web browsing or background file
downloads, where equal treatment is sufficient.
precedence - The "precedence" preset enables the legacy interpretation of the TOS (Type of Service) "Precedence" field. However, its usage on the
modern internet is discouraged, as it is an outdated mechanism. In the past, this field was used to indicate different levels of priority, such as high, medium,
or low, but it is no longer widely used or recommended.
diffserv4 - The "diffserv4" preset provides a general-purpose Diffserv implementation with four tins:
```
Bulk: This tin corresponds to CS1 (Class Selector 1) or LE (Low Extra), and it has a threshold of 6.25%. Traffic in this tin typically has a low
priority.
Best Effort: This tin is for general traffic that doesn't fall into any specific Diffserv class. It has a threshold of 100%, meaning it receives all
remaining bandwidth.
Video: This tin encompasses AF4x, AF3x, CS3, AF2x, CS2, TOS4, and TOS1. It has a threshold of 50%, providing a moderate priority for video
traffic.
Voice: This tin covers CS7, CS6, EF (Expedited Forwarding), VA (Voice Admit), CS5, and CS4. It has a threshold of 25%, giving high priority to
voice traffic.
```
In a network where video streaming, voice over IP (VoIP), and general internet traffic coexist, this preset can ensure that video and voice traffic receive
appropriate priority, while bulk and best-effort traffic are handled accordingly.
diffserv3 (default) - The "diffserv3" preset is the default Diffserv implementation in CAKE, providing three tins:
```
Bulk: Similar to the "diffserv4" preset, this tin represents CS1 or LE with a 6.25% threshold, serving as a low-priority traffic class.
Best Effort: This tin is for general traffic and has a threshold of 100%, treating all remaining traffic equally.
Voice: This tin covers CS7, CS6, EF, VA, and TOS4. It has a threshold of 25% and applies a reduced CoDel (Controlled Delay) interval, giving
high priority to voice traffic.
```
In a network where voice traffic requires high priority, such as a VoIP system, while other traffic falls into a general category, the "diffserv3" preset can
ensure appropriate priority for voice packets while maintaining fairness for other traffic.
diffserv8 - is an more advances purpuse diffserver with 8 tins:
The 8 classes in DiffServ8 are mapped to different types of network traffic based on their importance, using decimal values for Differentiated Services
Code Point (DSCP):
```
Network Control (48-63): Highest priority, often used for critical network traffic like routing information.
Telephony (46): Traffic sensitive to latency, such as VoIP.
Signaling (32-47): Control signals for real-time applications.
Multimedia Conferencing (24-31): Video conferencing traffic.
Real-time Interactive (40): Interactive applications, such as gaming.
Multimedia Streaming (16-23): Streaming video and audio.
Low Latency Data (8-15): Traffic requiring low latency, like financial transactions.
Best Effort (0): Default traffic class with no special priority.
```

"unlimited" or "autorate-ingress"
When using the "unlimited" or "autorate-ingress" option in the CAKE queue discipline, CAKE automatically determines the download speed based on
observed packet arrival times. Here's how it works:
```
Monitoring Packet Arrival Times: CAKE continuously monitors the arrival times of incoming packets. It keeps track of the time intervals between
consecutive packets to estimate the rate at which packets are being received.
Calculating Average Packet Arrival Rate: CAKE calculates the average packet arrival rate based on the observed arrival times. By dividing the
number of received packets by the total time elapsed, it determines the average rate at which packets are arriving.
Deriving Download Speed: From the average packet arrival rate, CAKE infers the download speed or throughput of the network connection. It
assumes that the packet arrival rate corresponds to the download speed, given that each packet represents a certain amount of data.
Dynamic Adjustment: As CAKE continues to monitor packet arrival times, it adjusts the download speed estimation dynamically. If the arrival rate
increases, CAKE will update the download speed estimate to reflect the higher throughput. Conversely, if the arrival rate decreases, CAKE will
adjust the estimate accordingly.
```
By automatically determining the download speed, CAKE adapts to changes in the network conditions and ensures that traffic shaping and queuing
algorithms are adjusted to optimize the utilization of available bandwidth.
It's worth noting that while CAKE can estimate the download speed based on packet arrival times, it does not have direct knowledge of the link capacity or
the true download speed as reported by the network equipment or service provider. Instead, it relies on observed packet arrival rates to approximate the
download speed for traffic shaping purposes.


# PFIFO,BFIFO

## PFIFO (Packet First-In, First-Out)

## Description:
PFIFO (Packet First-In, First-Out) is a queue management strategy that follows the basic queue logic. The main principle of PFIFO is that the first packet to
arrive is the first packet to be transmitted out. This method is simple, and straightforward, and ensures that no packet receives preferential treatment over
the others.
When packets enter the queue, they are placed at the end (tail) of the queue. As space becomes available for transmission, the packets at the front (head)
of the queue are transmitted first. If the queue is full when a packet arrives, the packet is dropped or other policies are followed, depending on the overall
queue management strategy in place.

## Characteristics:
```
Simplicity: PFIFO is one of the simplest forms of queue management. It doesn't require complex algorithms or significant computational
resources. This makes it easy to implement and understand.
Fairness: All packets are treated equally, regardless of their source, destination, or content. The first packet in is the first one out.
No Prioritization: There's no inherent capability to prioritize certain types of traffic over others. While this ensures fairness, it can be a drawback
when dealing with different types of network traffic that might need prioritization.
```

## Examples:
Imagine a line at the post office. Each person (packet) waiting in line represents a data packet waiting in the queue. The first person in line gets served
first, then the next, and so on. If the post office is too busy and the line is full, any new person arriving would have to wait or leave (the packet is dropped).

## Conclusion:
While PFIFO is simple and straightforward, its lack of traffic prioritization capabilities can be a downside, especially when managing network traffic that
contains different types of data. In these situations, more complex queue management algorithms, such as Priority Queuing (PQ), Class-Based Weighted
Fair Queuing (CBWFQ), or Low Latency Queuing (LLQ), might be more suitable.

## BFIFO (Byte First-In, First-Out)

## Description:
BFIFO (Byte First-In, First-Out) is another queue management strategy, similar to PFIFO in its principle of operation, but with a key difference: BFIFO
operates based on the size of packets, or bytes, rather than on the number of packets.
In a BFIFO system, when packets enter the queue, they are still placed at the end, and packets at the front are transmitted first. However, the queue size
is calculated in bytes, not in number of packets. When the queue reaches its maximum byte size, any new packets that arrive are dropped, or other
policies are followed.

## Characteristics:
```
Byte-Based: Unlike PFIFO, BFIFO calculates the queue size based on bytes, which allows for more precise control of bandwidth usage.
Fairness: BFIFO also ensures fairness as it treats all packets equally, regardless of their source, destination, or content.
No Prioritization: Similar to PFIFO, there's no inherent capability in BFIFO to prioritize certain types of traffic over others.
```

## Examples:
Consider a public bus as an example of a BFIFO system. The bus has a maximum capacity of passengers it can carry (similar to the byte size of the
queue). Even if there is a line of people waiting (packets), if the bus is full, new passengers cannot get on (packets are dropped).
Comparison: PFIFO vs. BFIFO
While both PFIFO and BFIFO are FIFO (First-In, First-Out) strategies and follow the basic queue logic, there are some differences:
```
Queue Size: PFIFO considers the queue size in terms of the number of packets, while BFIFO calculates the queue size in bytes. This means that
BFIFO takes into account the size of each packet, which can allow for more accurate control of bandwidth usage.
Packet Dropping: In PFIFO, packets are dropped when the queue is full in terms of the number of packets. In BFIFO, packets are dropped when
the byte size of the queue is exceeded, even if this means dropping a packet that is larger than the remaining space in the queue.
Fairness: Both PFIFO and BFIFO are fair in terms of the order of packet transmission – the first in is the first out. However, in a situation where
packets are of different sizes, PFIFO could lead to a situation where a large packet takes up a lot of resources but is treated the same as a
smaller packet. On the other hand, BFIFO's byte-based approach can provide more balanced resource usage.
Complexity: Both strategies are simple compared to more complex queuing strategies that prioritize certain types of traffic. However, BFIFO is
slightly more complex than PFIFO because it requires tracking the total size of all packets in the queue.
```
Overall, the choice between PFIFO and BFIFO depends on the specific requirements of your network and the characteristics of your traffic.


# Firewall and QoS Case Studies


# Building Advanced Firewall
```
Overview
Interface Lists
Protect the Device
Protect the Clients
Masquerade Local Network
RAW Filtering
IPv4 Address Lists
IPv4 RAW Rules
IPv6 Address Lists
IPv6 RAW Rules
```

## Overview
From everything we have learned so far, let's try to build an advanced firewall. In this firewall building example, we will try to use as many firewall features
as we can to illustrate how they work and when they should be used the right way.
Most of the filtering will be done in the RAW firewall, a regular firewall will contain just a basic rule set to accept established, related, and untracked
connections as well as dropping everything else not coming from LAN to fully protect the router.

## Interface Lists
Two interface lists will be used WAN and LAN for easier future management purposes. Interfaces connected to the global internet should be added to the
WAN list, in this case, it is ether1!
```
/interface list
add comment=defconf name=WAN
add comment=defconf name=LAN
/interface list member
add comment=defconf interface=bridge list=LAN
add comment=defconf interface=ether1 list=WAN
```

## Protect the Device
The main goal here is to allow access to the router only from LAN and drop everything else.
Notice that ICMP is accepted here as well, it is used to accept ICMP packets that passed RAW rules.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept ICMP after RAW" protocol=icmp
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept established,related,untracked" connection-
state=established,related,untracked
add action=drop chain=input comment="defconf: drop all not coming from LAN" in-interface-list=!LAN
```
IPv6 part is a bit more complicated, in addition, UDP traceroute, DHCPv6 client PD, and IPSec (IKE, AH, ESP) are accepted as per RFC recommendations.
```
/ipv6 firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept ICMPv6 after RAW" protocol=icmpv6
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept established,related,untracked" connection-
state=established,related,untracked
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept UDP traceroute" dst-port=33434-33534 protocol=udp
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept DHCPv6-Client prefix delegation." dst-port=546
protocol=udp src-address=fe80::/10
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept IKE" dst-port=500,4500 protocol=udp
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept IPSec AH" protocol=ipsec-ah
add action=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept IPSec ESP" protocol=ipsec-esp
add action=drop chain=input comment="defconf: drop all not coming from LAN" in-interface-list=!LAN
```
Protect the Clients
Before the actual set of rules, let's create a necessary address-list that contains all IPv4/6 addresses that cannot be forwarded.
Notice that in this list multicast address range is added. It is there because in most cases multicast is not used. If you intend to use multicast forwarding,
then this address list entry should be disabled.
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=0.0.0.0/8 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=no_forward_ipv4
add address=169.254.0.0/16 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=no_forward_ipv4
add address=224.0.0.0/4 comment="defconf: multicast" list=no_forward_ipv4
add address=255.255.255.255/32 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=no_forward_ipv4
```
In the same case for IPv6, if multicast forwarding is used then the multicast entry should be disabled from the address-list.
```
/ipv6 firewall address-list
add address=fe80::/10 comment="defconf: RFC6890 Linked-Scoped Unicast" list=no_forward_ipv6
add address=ff00::/8 comment="defconf: multicast" list=no_forward_ipv6
```
Forward chain will have a bit more rules than input:
```
accept established, related and untracked connections;
FastTrack established and related connections (currently only IPv4);
drop invalid connections;
drop bad forward IPs, since we cannot reliably determine in RAW chains which packets are forwarded
drop connections initiated from the internet (from the WAN side which is not destination NAT`ed);
drop bogon IPs that should not be forwarded.
```
We are dropping all non-dstnated IPv4 packets to protect direct attacks on the clients if the attacker knows the internal LAN network. Typically this rule
would not be necessary since RAW filters will drop such packets, however, the rule is there for double security in case RAW rules are accidentally messed
up.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept all that matches IPSec policy" ipsec-policy=in,ipsec
disabled=yes
add action=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment="defconf: fasttrack" connection-state=established,
related
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept established,related, untracked" connection-
state=established,related,untracked
add action=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop invalid" connection-state=invalid
add action=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop all from WAN not DSTNATed" connection-nat-state=!dstnat
connection-state=new in-interface-list=WAN
add action=drop chain=forward src-address-list=no_forward_ipv4 comment="defconf: drop bad forward IPs"
add action=drop chain=forward dst-address-list=no_forward_ipv4 comment="defconf: drop bad forward IPs"
```
IPv6 forward chain is very similar, except that IPsec and HIP are accepted as per RFC recommendations, and ICMPv6 with hop-limit=1 is dropped.
```
In certain setups where the DHCPv6 relay is used, the src address of the packets may not be from the link-local range. In that case, the src-
address parameter of rule #4 must be removed or adjusted to accept the relay address.
```
```
/ipv6 firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept established,related,untracked" connection-
state=established,related,untracked
add action=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop invalid" connection-state=invalid
add action=drop chain=forward src-address-list=no_forward_ipv6 comment="defconf: drop bad forward IPs"
add action=drop chain=forward dst-address-list=no_forward_ipv6 comment="defconf: drop bad forward IPs"
add action=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: rfc4890 drop hop-limit=1" hop-limit=equal:1 protocol=icmpv6
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept ICMPv6 after RAW" protocol=icmpv6
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept HIP" protocol=139
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept IKE" protocol=udp dst-port=500,4500
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept AH" protocol=ipsec-ah
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept ESP" protocol=ipsec-esp
add action=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept all that matches IPSec policy" ipsec-policy=in,ipsec
add action=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop everything else not coming from LAN" in-interface-list=!LAN
```
Notice the IPsec policy matcher rules. It is very important that IPsec encapsulated traffic bypass fast-track. That is why as an illustration we have added a
disabled rule to accept traffic matching IPsec policies. Whenever IPsec tunnels are used on the router this rule should be enabled. For IPv6 it is much
more simple since it does not have fast-track support.
Another approach to solving the IPsec problem is to add RAW rules, we will talk about this method later in the RAW section
Masquerade Local Network
For local devices behind the router to be able to access the internet, local networks must be masqueraded. In most cases, it is advised to use src-nat
instead of masquerade, however in this case when the WAN address is dynamic it is the only option.
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=accept chain=srcnat comment="defconf: accept all that matches IPSec policy" ipsec-policy=out,ipsec
disabled=yes
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat comment="defconf: masquerade" out-interface-list=WAN
```
Notice the disabled policy matcher rule, the same as in firewall filters IPSec traffic must be excluded from being NATed (except in specific scenarios where
IPsec policy is configured to match NAT`ed address). So whenever IPsec tunnels are used on the router this rule must be enabled.
RAW Filtering
IPv4 Address Lists
Before setting RAW rules, let's create some address lists necessary for our filtering policy. RFC 6890 will be used as a reference.
First, address-list contains all IPv4 addresses that cannot be used as src/dst/forwarded, etc. (will be dropped immediately if such address is seen)
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=127.0.0.0/8 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=bad_ipv4
add address=192.0.0.0/24 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=bad_ipv4
add address=192.0.2.0/24 comment="defconf: RFC6890 documentation" list=bad_ipv4
add address=198.51.100.0/24 comment="defconf: RFC6890 documentation" list=bad_ipv4
add address=203.0.113.0/24 comment="defconf: RFC6890 documentation" list=bad_ipv4
add address=240.0.0.0/4 comment="defconf: RFC6890 reserved" list=bad_ipv4
```
Another address list contains all IPv4 addresses that cannot be routed globally.
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=0.0.0.0/8 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=10.0.0.0/8 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=100.64.0.0/10 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=169.254.0.0/16 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=172.16.0.0/12 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=192.0.0.0/29 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=192.168.0.0/16 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=198.18.0.0/15 comment="defconf: RFC6890 benchmark" list=not_global_ipv4
add address=255.255.255.255/32 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=not_global_ipv4
```
And last two address lists for addresses that cannot be as destination or source address.
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=224.0.0.0/4 comment="defconf: multicast" list=bad_src_ipv4
add address=255.255.255.255/32 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=bad_src_ipv4
add address=0.0.0.0/8 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=bad_dst_ipv4
add address=224.0.0.0/4 comment="defconf: RFC6890" list=bad_dst_ipv4
```
IPv4 RAW Rules
Raw IPv4 rules will perform the following actions:
```
add disabled "accept" rule - can be used to quickly disable RAW filtering without disabling all RAW rules;
accept DHCP discovery - most of the DHCP packets are not seen by an IP firewall, but some of them are, so make sure that they are accepted;
drop packets that use bogon IPs;
drop from invalid SRC and DST IPs;
drop globally unroutable IPs coming from WAN;
drop packets with source-address not equal to 192.168.88.0/24 (default IP range) coming from LAN;
drop packets coming from WAN to be forwarded to 192.168.88.0/24 network, this will protect from attacks if the attacker knows the internal
network;
drop bad ICMP, UDP, and TCP;
accept everything else coming from WAN and LAN;
drop everything else, to make sure that any newly added interface (like PPPoE connection to service provider) is protected against accidental
misconfiguration.
```
```
/ip firewall raw
add action=accept chain=prerouting comment="defconf: enable for transparent firewall" disabled=yes

add action=accept chain=prerouting comment="defconf: accept everything else from WAN" in-interface-list=WAN
add action=drop chain=prerouting comment="defconf: drop the rest"
```
Notice that we used some optional chains, the first TCP chain to drop TCP packets known to be invalid.
```
/ip firewall raw
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment="defconf: TCP flag filter" protocol=tcp tcp-flags=!fin,!syn,!rst,!ack
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=fin,syn
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=fin,rst
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=fin,!ack
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=fin,urg
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=syn,rst
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment=defconf protocol=tcp tcp-flags=rst,urg
add action=drop chain=bad_tcp comment="defconf: TCP port 0 drop" port=0 protocol=tcp
```
And another chain for ICMP. Note that if you want a very strict firewall then such strict ICMP filtering can be used, but in most cases, it is not necessary
and simply adds more load on the router's CPU. ICMP rate limit in most cases is also unnecessary since the Linux kernel is already limiting ICMP packets
to 100pps.
```
/ip firewall raw

IPv6 RAW Rules
Raw IPv6 rules will perform the following actions:
```
add disabled accept rule - can be used to quickly disable RAW filtering without disabling all RAW rules;
drop packets that use bogon IPs;
drop from invalid SRC and DST IPs;
drop globally unroutable IPs coming from WAN;
drop bad ICMP;
accept everything else coming from WAN and LAN;
drop everything else, to make sure that any newly added interface (like PPPoE connection to service provider) is protected against accidental
misconfiguration.

Notice that the optional ICMP chain was used. If you want a very strict firewall then such strict ICMP filtering can be used, but in most cases, it is not
necessary and simply adds more load on the router's CPU. ICMP rate limit in most cases is also unnecessary since the Linux kernel is already limiting
ICMP packets to 100pps

# Port knocking
All available public IP addresses are constantly being port scanned by bots and services like shodan.io and anyone can use this information to perform
brute-force attacks and execute any known exploits. Port knocking is a cost-effective way to defend against this by not exposing any ports and simply
listening to connection attempts - if the correct sequence of port connection attempts is made, the client is considered safe and added to a list of secured
address list that bypass the WAN firewall rules.

## Setup example
We are assuming you have already set up a firewall that drops all connection attempts from the WAN port, so you will need to add additional rules before
that.
First, create a firewall rule that listens on a given port and adds the connected source IP to an address list - this is the first knock.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=888 address-list-timeout=30s chain=input
dst-port=888 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcp
```
Then add a rule that does the same on another port, but only approves IPs that are already in the first list. You can repeat this step as many times as you
like.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=555 address-list-timeout=30s chain=input
dst-port=555 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcp src-address-list=888
```
Finally, the last knock will be added to an IP list that is trusted and any input is accepted.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=secured address-list-timeout=30m
chain=input dst-port=222 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcp src-address-list=555
/ip/firewall/filter add action=accept chain=input in-interface-list=WAN src-address-list=secured
```

## Knock to gain access
To access the board from WAN, a port-knocking client could be used, but a simple bash one-liner with nmap can do the job.
```
for x in 888,555,222; do nmap -p $x -Pn xx.xx.xx.xx; done
```

## Blacklists
Unless you are using a lot of knocks, a simple port scan could accidentally trigger the correct ports in the correct order, so it is advisable to add a blacklist
as well.
At the very top of your firewall stack add a drop rule for the blacklist.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=drop chain=input disabled=yes in-interface-list=WAN src-address-list=blacklist
```
Then add suspicious IPs to the blacklist.
Bad ports - ones that will never be used by a trusted user and hence have a high timeout penalty.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=blacklist address-list-timeout=1000m
chain=input disabled=yes dst-port=666 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcp
```
Ports that slow down the port scanning process significantly to the point where it is pointless, but will never lock out a real user for too long. This could
include every single port apart from the 'knock' ports, the key is that the source IP is not already in the secure list and hence those ports can be used after
a successful knock.
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=blacklist address-list-timeout=1m
chain=input disabled=yes dst-port=21,22,23,8291,10000-60000 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcp src-address-
list=!secured
```
Use a passphrase for each knock
You could go even further by sending a passphrase with each knock.
Then create a layer7 regex check that can be requested on the knock rule.
/ip firewall layer7-protocol add name=pass regexp="^passphrase/$"
/ip firewall filter
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=888 address-list-timeout=30s chain=input dst-port=888 in-interface-list=WAN protocol=udp layer7-
protocol=pass
```
Blacklist rules from this section are added disabled=yes in order to avoid locking out the user. Enable the filter rules, once the alternative access
available or use <Safe Mode>
```
```
Warning
```
```
Layer7 rules are very resource-intensive. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.
```
```

# DDoS Protection

## Introduction
A denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or
network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. There are several types of DDoS attacks, for example,
HTTP flood, SYN flood, DNS amplification, etc.

## Protection against DDoS

## Configuration lines
```
/ip firewall address-list
add list=ddos-attackers
add list=ddos-targets
/ip firewall filter
add action=return chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s
add action=add-dst-to-address-list address-list=ddos-targets address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=ddos-attackers address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos
/ip firewall raw
add action=drop chain=prerouting dst-address-list=ddos-targets src-address-list=ddos-attackers
```

## Configuration Explained
First, we will send every new connection to the specific firewall chain where we will detect DDoS:
```
/ip/firewall/filter/add chain=forward connection-state=new action=jump jump-target=detect-ddos
```
```
These rules are only an improvement for firewall, do not forget to properly secure your device.
```
In the newly created chain, we will add the following rule with the "dst-limit" parameter. This parameter is written in the following format: dst-limit=count[
/time],burst,mode[/expire]. We will match 32 packets with 32 packet burst based on destination and source address flow, which renews every 10 seconds.
The rule will work until a given rate is exceeded.
```
/ip/firewall/filter/add chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s action=return
```
So far all the legitimate traffic should go through the "action=return", but in the case of DoS/DDoS "dst-limit" buffer will be fulfilled and a rule will not "catch"
any new traffic. Here come the next rules, which will deal with the attack. Let`s start with creating a list for attackers and victims which we will drop:
```
ip/firewall/address-list/add list=ddos-attackers
ip/firewall/address-list/add list=ddos-targets
ip/firewall/raw/add chain=prerouting action=drop src-address-list=ddos-attackers dst-address-list=ddos-targets
```
With the firewall filter section, we will add attackers in the "DDoS-attackers" and victims in list "ddos-targets" list:
```
/ip/firewall/filter/
add action=add-dst-to-address-list address-list=ddos-targets address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=ddos-attackers address-list-timeout=10m chain=detect-ddos
```
SYN Attack
SYN Flood
An SYN flood is a form of DoS attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough
server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic. Fortunately, in RouterOS we have a specific feature for such an attack:
```
/ip/settings/set tcp-syncookies=yes
```
The feature works by sending back ACK packets that contain a little cryptographic hash, which the responding client will echo back with as part of its SYN-
ACK packet. If the kernel doesn't see this "cookie" in the reply packet, it will assume the connection is bogus and drop it.
SYN-ACK Flood
An SYN-ACK flood is an attack method that involves sending a target server spoofed SYN-ACK packet at a high rate. The server requires significant
resources to process such packets out-of-order (not in accordance with the normal SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK TCP three-way handshake mechanism), it can
become so busy handling the attack traffic, that it cannot handle legitimate traffic and hence the attackers achieve a DoS/DDoS condition. In RouterOS, we
can configure similar rules from the previously mentioned example, but more specifically for SYN-ACK flood:
```
/ip/firewall/filter add action=return chain=detect-ddos dst-limit=32,32,src-and-dst-addresses/10s protocol=tcp
tcp-flags=syn,ack
```


# Connection rate
```
Introduction
Theory
Rule Example
Application Example - Traffic Prioritization
Quick Start for Impatient
Explanation
IP Firewall mangle

```

## Introduction
Connection Rate is a firewall matcher that allows capturing traffic based on the present speed of the connection.

## Theory
Each entry in the connection tracking table represents bidirectional communication. Every time a packet gets associated with a particular entry, the packet
size value (including the IP header) is added to the "connection-bytes" value for this entry. (in other words "connection-bytes" includes both - upload and
download).
Connection Rate calculates the speed of connection based on the change of "connection-bytes". The connection rate is recalculated every second and
does not have any averages.
Both options "connection-bytes" and "connection-rate" work only with TCP and UDP traffic. (you need to specify a protocol to activate these options). In the
"connection-rate" you can specify a range of speed that you like to capture:
```
ConnectionRate ::= [!]From-To
From,To ::= 0..4294967295 (integer number)
```

## Rule Example
These rules will capture TCP/UDP traffic that was going through the router when the connection speed was below 100kbps:
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward connection-rate=0-100k protocol=tcp
add action=accept chain=forward connection-rate=0-100k protocol=udp
```

## Application Example - Traffic Prioritization
Connection-rate can be used in various ways, that still need to be realized, but the most common setup will be to detect and set lower priorities to the
"heavy connections" (connections that maintain a fast rate for long periods (such as P2P, HTTP, FTP downloads). By doing this you can prioritize all other
traffic that usually includes VoIP and HTTP browsing and online gaming.
The method described in this example can be used together with other ways to detect and prioritize traffic. As the connection-rate option does not have
any averages we need to determine what will be the margin that identifies "heavy connections". If we assume that a normal HTTP browsing connection is
less than 500kB (4Mb) long and VoIP requires no more than 200kbps speed, then every connection that after the first 500kB still has more than 200kbps
speed can be assumed as "heavy".
(You might have different "connection-bytes" for HTTP browsing and different "connection-rate" for VoIP in your network - so, please, do your own
research before applying this example)
For this example, let's assume that we have a 6Mbps upload and download connection to ISP.
Quick Start for Impatient
```
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-mark=!heavy_traffic_conn new-connection-mark=all_conn
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-bytes=500000-0 connection-mark=all_conn connection-

passthrough=no
add chain=forward action=mark-packet connection-mark=all_conn new-packet-mark=other_traffic passthrough=no
```
```
/queue tree
add name=upload parent=public max-limit=6M
add name=other_upload parent=upload limit-at=4M max-limit=6M packet-mark=other_traffic priority=1
add name=heavy_upload parent=upload limit-at=2M max-limit=6M packet-mark=heavy_traffic priority=8
add name=download parent=local max-limit=6M
add name=other_download parent=download limit-at=4M max-limit=6M packet-mark=other_traffic priority=1
add name=heavy_download parent=download limit-at=2M max-limit=6M packet-mark=heavy_traffic priority=8
```
Explanation
In mangle, we need to separate all connections into two groups, and then mark packets from their 2 groups. As we are talking about client traffic most
logical place for marking would be the mangle chain forward.
Keep in mind that as soon as a "heavy" connection will have lower priority and queue will hit max-limit - heavy connection will drop speed, and connection-
rate will be lower. This will result in a change to a higher priority and the connection will be able to get more traffic for a short while, when again connection-
rate will rise and that again will result in a change to lower priority). To avoid this we must make sure that once detected "heavy connections" will remain
marked as "heavy connections" for all times.
IP Firewall mangle
This rule will ensure that that "heavy" connections will remain heavy". and mark the rest of the connections with the default connection mark:
```
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-mark=!heavy_traffic_conn new-connection-mark=all_conn
```
These two rules will mark all heavy connections based on our standards, that every connection that after the first 500kB still has more than 200kbps speed
can be assumed as "heavy":
```
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-bytes=500000-0 \
connection-mark=all_conn connection-rate=200k-100M new-connection-mark=heavy_traffic_conn protocol=tcp
add chain=forward action=mark-connection connection-bytes=500000-0 \
connection-mark=all_conn connection-rate=200k-100M new-connection-mark=heavy_traffic_conn protocol=udp
```
The last two rules in mangle will simply mark all traffic from corresponding connections:
```
add chain=forward action=mark-packet connection-mark=heavy_traffic_conn new-packet-mark=heavy_traffic
passthrough=no
add chain=forward action=mark-packet connection-mark=all_conn new-packet-mark=other_traffic passthrough=no
```
Queue
This is a simple queue tree that is placed on the Interface HTB - "public" is an interface where your ISP is connected, and "local" is where are your clients.
If you have more than 1 "public" or more than 1 "local" you will need to mangle upload and download separately and place the queue tree in global-out:
/queue tree
add name=upload parent=public max-limit=6M
add name=other_upload parent=upload limit-at=4M max-limit=6M packet-mark=other_traffic priority=1
add name=heavy_upload parent=upload limit-at=2M max-limit=6M packet-mark=heavy_traffic priority=8
add name=download parent=local max-limit=6M
add name=other_download parent=download limit-at=4M max-limit=6M packet-mark=other_traffic priority=1
add name=heavy_download parent=download limit-at=2M max-limit=6M packet-mark=heavy_traffic priority=8


# Bruteforce prevention
Here is an example of how to defend against bruteforce attacks on an SSH port. Please note, that ssh allows 3 login attempts per connection, and the
address lists are not cleared upon a successful login, so it is possible to blacklist yourself accidentally.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=bruteforce_blacklist address-list-timeout=1d chain=input
comment=Blacklist connection-state=new dst-port= 22  protocol=tcp src-address-list=connection3
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=connection3 address-list-timeout=1h chain=input comment="Third
attempt" connection-state=new dst-port= 22  protocol=tcp src-address-list=connection2
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=connection2 address-list-timeout=15m chain=input comment="Second
attempt" connection-state=new dst-port= 22  protocol=tcp src-address-list=connection1
add action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=connection1 address-list-timeout=5m chain=input comment="First
attempt" connection-state=new dst-port= 22  protocol=tcp
add action=accept chain=input dst-port= 22  protocol=tcp src-address-list=!bruteforce_blacklist
```
If the timeouts were kept at 1min for all three lists - connection1/2/3 - then someone could perform 9 guesses every minute, with the above structure they
can do a maximum of 3 guesses per 5min.
```
Address list naming is following the naming of the Port knocking article. Similar naming scheme is used, trusted address list is named as
"secured".

# UPnP

## Introduction
The MikroTik RouterOS supports Universal Plug and Play architecture for transparent peer-to-peer network connectivity of personal computers and
network-enabled intelligent devices or appliances.
UPnP enables data communication between any two devices under the command of any control device on the network. Universal Plug and Play is
completely independent of any particular physical medium. It supports networking with automatic discovery without any initial configuration, whereby a
device can dynamically join a network. DHCP and DNS servers are optional and will be used if available on the network. UPnP implements a simple yet
powerful NAT traversal solution, that enables the client to get full two-way peer-to-peer network support from behind the NAT.
There are two interface types for UPnP: internal (the one local clients are connected to) and external (the one the Internet is connected to). A router may
only have one active external interface with a 'public' IP address on it, and as many internal interfaces as needed, all with source-NATted 'internal' IP
addresses. The protocol works by creating dynamic NAT entries.
The UPnP protocol is used for many modern applications, like most DirectX games, as well as for various Windows Messenger features like remote
assistance, application sharing, file transfer, voice, and video from behind a firewall.

## Configuration

## General properties
```
/ip upnp
```
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-disable-
external-
interface (yes
| no ; Default: y
es)
```
```
whether or not the users are allowed to disable the router's external interface. This functionality (for users to be able to turn the
router's external interface off without any authentication procedure) is required by the standard, but as it is sometimes not expected
or unwanted in UPnP deployments which the standard was not designed for (it was designed mostly for home users to establish their
own local networks), you can disable this behavior
```
```
enabled (yes |
no ; Default: no
)
```
```
Enable UPnP service
```
```
show-dummy-
rule (yes | no ;
Default: yes)
```
```
Enable a workaround for some broken implementations, which are handling the absence of UPnP rules incorrectly (for example,
popping up error messages). This option will instruct the server to install a dummy (meaningless) UPnP rule that can be observed by
the clients, which refuse to work correctly otherwise
```

## UPnP Interfaces
```
/ip upnp interfaces
```
```
Property Description
```
```
UPnP internal interface can create NAT mapping for any subnet, not just the subnet present on the internal interface, so caution must be used
when setting internal interfaces.
```
```
If you do not disable the allow-disable-external-interface, any user from the local network will be able (without any authentication procedures) to
disable the router's external interface
```
```
interface (string; Default: ) Interface name on which uPnP will be running
```
```
type (external | internal; Default: no) UPnP interface type:
```
```
external - the interface a global IP address is assigned to
internal - router's local interface the clients are connected to
```
```
forced-external-ip (Ip; Default: ) Allow specifying what public IP to use if the external interface has more than one IP available.
```
Configuration Example
```
In more complex setups with VLANs, where the VLAN interface is considered as the LAN interface, the VLAN interface itself should be specified
as the internal interface for UPnP to work properly.
```
We have masquerading already enabled on our router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp> /ip firewall src-nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp>
```
To enable the UPnP feature:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp> set enable=yes
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp> print
enabled: yes
allow-disable-external-interface: yes
show-dummy-rule: yes
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp>
```
Now, all we have to do is to add interfaces:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp interfaces> add interface=ether1 type=external
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp interfaces> add interface=ether2 type=internal
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp interfaces> print
Flags: X - disabled
# INTERFACE TYPE
0 X ether1 external
1 X ether2 internal
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip upnp interfaces> enable 0,1
```
Now once the client from the internal interface side sends UPnP request, dynamic NAT rules will be created on the router, example rules could look
something similar to these:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip firewall nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
```
```
0 chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
```
```
1 D ;;; upnp 192.168.88.10: ApplicationX
chain=dstnat action=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.88.10 to-ports=55000 protocol=tcp
dst-address=10.0.0.1 in-interface=ether1 dst-port=55000
```
```
2 D ;;; upnp 192.168.88.10: ApplicationX
chain=dstnat action=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.88.10 to-ports=55000 protocol=udp
dst-address=10.0.0.1 in-interface=ether1 dst-port=55000
```


# NAT-PMP

## Introduction
NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) is a protocol used for transparent peer-to-peer network connectivity of personal computers and network-enabled
intelligent devices or appliances.
Protocol operates by retrieving the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make its external IPv4 address and port known to
peers who may wish to communicate with it by creating dynamic NAT rules.
NAT-PMP uses UDP port number 5350 - on the client, and 5351 on the server side.
There are two interface types for PMP: internal (the one local clients are connected to) and external (the one the Internet is connected to).A router may
only have one active external interface with a 'public' IP address on it
For more details on NAT PMP see RFC 6886
NAT-PMP configuration is accessible from /ip nat-pmp menu.

## Configuration Example
```
A router can have only one active external interface with a 'public' IP address on it. NAT-PMP internal interface can create NAT mapping for any
subnet, not just the subnet present on the internal interface, so caution must be used when setting internal interfaces.
```
Let's consider that we already have this basic home setup illustrated above.
Before enabling PMP-NAT we need to masquerade outgoing LAN packets.
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1
```
Now we can enable PMP and add internal, external interfaces:
```
/ip nat-pmp set enable=yes
/ip nat-pmp interfaces> add interface=ether1 type=external disabled=no
/ip nat-pmp interfaces> add interface=ether2 type=internal disabled=no
```
When the client from the internal interface side sends PMP request, dynamic NAT rules are created on the router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip firewall nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
```
```
0 chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
```
```
1 D ;;; nat-pmp 192.168.88.10: ApplicationX
chain=dstnat action=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.88.10 to-ports=55000 protocol=tcp
dst-address=10.0.0.1 in-interface=ether1 dst-port=55000
```
```
2 D ;;; nat-pmp 192.168.88.10: ApplicationX
chain=dstnat action=dst-nat to-addresses=192.168.88.10 to-ports=55000 protocol=udp
dst-address=10.0.0.1 in-interface=ether1 dst-port=55000
```

specified as the internal interface.

# IP Services

## Services
This section lists protocols and ports used by various MikroTik RouterOS services. It helps you to determine why your MikroTik router listens to certain
ports, and what you need to block/allow in case you want to prevent or grant access to certain services.
The default services are:
```
Property Description
```
```
telnet Telnet service
```
```
ftp FTP service
```
```
www Webfig HTTP service
```
```
ssh SSH service
```
```
www-ssl Webfig HTTPS service
```
```
api API service
```
```
winbox Responsible for Winbox tool access, as well as Tik-App smartphone app and Dude probe
```
```
api-ssl API over SSL service
```

## Properties
Note that it is not possible to add new services, only existing service modifications are allowed.
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IP address/netmask | IPv6/0..
128 ; Default: )
```
```
List of IP/IPv6 prefixes from which the service is accessible.
```
```
certificate (name; default: none) The name of the certificate used by a particular service. Applicable only for services that depend on
certificates (www-ssl, api-ssl)
```
```

```
To restrict Winbox service access to the device only from the 192.168.88.0/24 subnet, we have to configure the following:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip service set [find name~"winbox"] address=192.168.88.0/24
[admin@MikroTik] > ip service print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
# NAME PORT ADDRESS CERTIFICATE

1 XI ftp 21
2 XI www 80
3 ssh 22
4 XI www-ssl 443 none
5 XI api 8728
6 winbox 8291 192.168.88.0/24
7 XI api-ssl 8729 none
```
```
We recommend disabling unused services.

## Introduction
Network load balancing is the ability to balance traffic across two or more links without using dynamic routing protocols.
There are two type of balancing methods:
```
per-packet - each packet of a single stream can be forwarded over different links. This method will work reliably especially on TCP and secure
connections only when you are able to control both balancing endpoints.
per-connection - all packets of the same connection (stream) is always sent over one link. This method is mandatory in setups where only one
end of the balancing is under our control, for example, home router with multiple WAN connections.
```

```
```

```
```

```
```
BGP Yes No
```

## Simple Failover Example
Simplest failover setup would be to use multiple gateways when one gateway is active and another one takes over when the first one fails.
To make this work, configure larger distance value for the secondary one, and check-gateway for the first one:
```
/ip route add gateway=192.168.1.1 distance=1 check-gateway=ping
/ip route add gateway=192.168.2.1 distance=2
```
The check-gateway will make sure the gateway is up only when actual traffic can reach the gateway. When the ping fails the first gateway will become
inactive and the second one will take over,  and when the first gateway recovers  it will become active and make the second gateway to work again as a
backup.


# Failover (WAN Backup)

## Introduction
In this article, we will look at another advanced method of failover using recursive routing and scopes from the routing section. Recursive routing occurs
when a route (either static or dynamically learned) has a next-hop that is not directly connected to the local router. It is necessary to restrict a set of routes
that can be used to look up immediate next-hops. Nexthop values of RIP or OSPF routes, for example, are supposed to be directly reachable and should
be looked up only using connected routes. This is achieved using a scope and target-scope properties.

## Setup Overview
Let's assume that our gateway has two public network uplinks ("ISP1", "ISP2"). First uplink should be preferred and second one should act as a backup.
Then we mark traffic in two parts, one with the name "ISP1" and the second as "ISP2" which goes through the ether1 and ether2 accordingly. In this setup,
we want to monitor two hosts: Host1 and Host2. We will use Google DNS servers with IP 8.8.8.8 (Host1) and 8.8.4.4 (Host2), but it is not mandatory to use
specifically these addresses.

## Configuration

## Basic failover
First things first, since we have a local address space we need to masquerade LAN traffic on both uplinks:
```
/ip/firewall/nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether2
```
Next we want to pick tow hosts on the internet and make them reachable each on its own uplink. Generally you would pick hosts that are always supposed
to be reachable, accepts ICMP, in this example we will use google DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).
```
/ip/route/
add dst-address=8.8.8.8 scope=10 gateway=10.111.0.1
add dst-address=8.8.4.4 scope=10 gateway=10.112.0.1
```
And add default routes recursively resolved over both hosts with ISP1 being the primary one (by having smaller distance):
```
/ip/route/
add distance=1 gateway=8.8.8.8 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping
add distance=2 gateway=8.8.4.4 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping
```
Improve detection reliability
At this point we are relying link reachability on a single host. Even though google services are very rarely down we can still improve reliability by adding a
second host on each link.
```
/ip/route
add dst-address=208.67.222.222 gateway=10.111.0.1 scope=10
add dst-address=208.67.220.220 gateway=10.112.0.1 scope=10
```
```
add distance=1 gateway=208.67.222.222 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping
add distance=2 gateway=208.67.220.220 target-scope=11 check-gateway=ping
```
Essentially what it does is creates ECMP default route and if only one of the gateways is not reachable default route on the first link will still be active.
Complete switchover to second link will happen only if all the gateways become unreachable.


# OSPF Load Balancing (restricted)


# Per connection classifier
PCC matcher will allow you to divide traffic into equal streams with the ability to keep packets with specific set of options in one particular stream (you can
specify this set of options from src-address, src-port, dst-address, dst-port)
```

Example
How PCC works
Configuration Example
IP Addresses
Policy routing
NAT
```

## Theory
PCC takes selected fields from IP header, and with the help of a hashing algorithm converts selected fields into 32-bit value. This value then is divided by a
specified Denominator and the remainder then is compared to a specified Remainder, if equal then the packet will be captured. You can choose from src-
address, dst-address, src-port, dst-port from the header to use in this operation.
```
per-connection-classifier=
PerConnectionClassifier ::= [!]ValuesToHash:Denominator/Remainder
Remainder ::= 0..4294967295 (integer number)
Denominator ::= 1..4294967295 (integer number)
ValuesToHash ::= both-addresses|both-ports|dst-address-and-port|
src-address|src-port|both-addresses-and-ports|dst-address|dst-port|src-address-and-port
```

## Example
This configuration will divide all connections into 3 groups based on the source address and port
```
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=1st_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/0
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=2nd_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/1
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=3rd_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/2
```

## How PCC works
This article aims to explain in simple terms how PCC works. The definition from the official manual wiki page reads: "PCC takes selected fields from IP
header, and with the help of a hashing algorithm converts selected fields into 32-bit value. This value then is divided by a specified Denominator and the
remainder then is compared to a specified Remainder, if equal then packet will be captured. You can choose from src-address, dst-address, src-port, dst-
port from the header to use in this operation.", with the full number of fields available being: "both-addresses|both-ports|dst-address-and-port|src-
address|src-port|both-addresses-and-ports|dst-address|dst-port|src-address-and-port". If you understand that definition, there'll be nothing interesting in
this article for you.
First, here are the terms necessary to understand the definition.
IP packets have a header that contains several fields, two of those fields are the IP address of the source of the packet and the IP address of the
destination of the packet. TCP and UDP packets also have headers that contain the source port and the destination port.
Denominators and remainders are parts of modulus operations. A modulus operation produces the integer left over when you divide two numbers and only
accept the whole number portion of the result. It is represented by a % sign. Here are some examples: 3 % 3 = 0, because 3 divides cleanly by 3. 4 % 3 =
1, because the next smallest number to 4 that cleanly divides by 3 is 3, and 4 - 3 = 1. 5 % 3 is 2, because the next smallest number to 5 that divides
cleanly by 3 is 3, and 5 - 3 = 2. 6 % 3 = 0, because 6 divides cleanly by 3.
```
PCC is not a valid method, in case of Hotspot(captive portal) -  due to the fact  that Hotspot  uses web-proxy and it uses only the default routing
table, at the moment.
```
A hash is a function that is fed input, and produces output. Hashes have many interesting properties, but the only important one for the purpose of this
article is that hash functions are deterministic. That means that when you feed a hash function an input that reads 'hello' and it produces the output '1', you
can rely on the fact that if you feed it 'hello' a second time it will produce the output '1' again. When you feed a hash function the same input, it will always
produce the same output. What exact hashing algorithm is used by PCC is not important, so for this discussion let's assume that when you feed it IP
addresses and ports, it just adds up the octets of the IP addresses as decimal numbers as well as the ports, and then takes the last digit and produces it
as the output. Here an example:
The hash function is fed 1.1.1.1 as the source IP address, 10000 as the source TCP port, 2.2.2.2 as the destination IP address and 80 as the destination
TCP port. The output will be 1+1+1+1+10000+2+2+2+2+80 = 10092, the last digit of that is 2, so the hash output is 2. It will produce 2 every time it is fed
that combination of IP addresses and ports.
At this point it's important to note that even though PCC is most often used for spreading load across circuits, PCC itself has absolutely nothing to do with
routing, routing marks or spreading load. PCC is simply a way to match packets, and not directly related to the action of then marking those matched
packets even if that is its main purpose.
Here are three lines often used for PCC, with their explanation:
```
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=1st_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/0
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=2nd_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/1
/ip firewall mangle add chain=prerouting action=mark-connection \
new-connection-mark=3rd_conn per-connection-classifier=src-address-and-port:3/2
```
Here are what the different field options mean for the purpose of packet matching, these are the fields that will be fed into the hashing algorithm (and, for
the purpose of spreading load across links, decide what link a packet will be put on). Remember that a hash function will always produce the same input
when it's fed the same output:
```
src-address: The source address of a client will always be the same, so all traffic from a particular client will always match the same PCC
matcher, and will always be put on the same link.
dst-address: The destination address of a specific server will always be the same, so all traffic to that server (say, the Mikrotik Wiki) will always
match the same PCC matcher, and will always be put on the same link.
both-addresses: The source and destination IP pair between the same client and server will always be the same, so all traffic between one
specific client and a specific server (say, your laptop and the Mikrotik Wiki) will always match the same PCC matcher, and will always be put on
the same link.
src-port: Source ports of clients are usually randomly chosen when the connection is created, so across many connections different source ports
will be fed into the hash function, and different PCC matchers will match and traffic will go across different links. However, some client protocols
always choose the same source port, and servers behind your router will mostly likely always use the same service port to send traffic back to
their clients. A web server behind your router would send most traffic from its HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports, and that traffic would always
match the same PCC matcher and would be put on the same link.
dst-port: Destination ports of clients are usually well defined service ports, all HTTP (80) traffic between your clients and servers on the Internet
would always match the same PCC matcher, and would be put on the same link. However, the same clients doing HTTPS (443) traffic could
match a different PCC matcher, and would go across a different link.
both-ports: Since the client port is (usually) randomly chosen, the combination of the two ports is (usually) random and will spread load across
links.
src-address-and-port: Same caveat as src-port.
dst-address-and-port: Same caveat as dst-port.
both-addresses-and-ports: This is the most random way to spread traffic across links, since it has the most number of variables.
```
It's important to note that even though the hash function discussed in this article is greatly simplified and not what is used in real life, it nicely demonstrates
another property of hash functions: two completely different inputs can produce the same output. In our example, 3 % 3 = 0, and 6 % 3 = 0; we get back 0
when we feed it a 3 as well as when we feed it a 6. The same is true for the actual function used for PCC, even though I don't know what it is we do know
from the definition that it produces a 32 bit value as output. IP addresses are 32 bit, and ports are 16 bit, so assuming that we're using both-addresses-and-
ports, we'd be feeding it 32+32+16+16 = 96 bits of input and would only receive 32 bits back, so it must be producing the same output for different inputs.
This means that two completely unrelated connections could match the same PCC matcher, and would be put on the same line. PCC works better the
more connections you put across it so that the hash function has more chances to produce different outputs.
Configuration Example
Let's assume this configuration:
IP Addresses
```
/ip address
add address=10.10.4.100/24 interface=ether_ISP1 network=10.10.4.0
add address=10.10.5.100/24 interface=ether_ISP2 network=10.10.5.0
add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=ether_LAN network=192.168.100.0
```
The router has two upstream (ISP) interfaces with the addresses of 10.10.4.100/24 and 10.10.5.100/24. The LAN interface has IP address of 192.168.0.1
/24.
We are adding two new Routing tables, which will be used later:
```
/routing table
add disabled=no fib name=ISP1_table
add disabled=no fib name=ISP2_table
```
Policy routing
```
/ip firewall mangle
add action=accept chain=prerouting dst-address=10.10.4.0/24 in-interface=ether_LAN
add action=accept chain=prerouting dst-address=10.10.5.0/24 in-interface=ether_LAN
```
With policy routing it is possible to force all traffic to the specific gateway, even if traffic is destined to the host (other that gateway) from the connected
networks. This way routing loop will be generated and communications with those hosts will be impossible. To avoid this situation we need to allow usage
of default routing table for traffic to connected networks.
```
add action=mark-connection chain=input connection-state=new in-interface=ether_ISP1 new-connection-mark=ISP1
add action=mark-connection chain=input connection-state=new in-interface=ether_ISP2 new-connection-mark=ISP2
```
```
add action=mark-connection chain=output connection-mark=no-mark connection-state=new new-connection-mark=ISP1
passthrough=yes per-connection-classifier=both-addresses:2/0
add action=mark-connection chain=output connection-mark=no-mark connection-state=new new-connection-mark=ISP2
per-connection-classifier=both-addresses:2/1
```
First it is necessary to manage connection initiated from outside - replies must leave via same interface (from same Public IP) request came. We will mark
all new incoming connections, to remember what was the interface.
```
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-mark=no-mark connection-state=new dst-address-type=!
local in-interface=ether_LAN new-connection-mark=ISP1 per-connection-classifier=both-addresses:2/0
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-mark=no-mark connection-state=new dst-address-type=!
local in-interface=ether_LAN new-connection-mark=ISP2 per-connection-classifier=both-addresses:2/1
```
Action mark-routing can be used only in mangle chain output and prerouting, but mangle chain prerouting is capturing all traffic that is going to the router
itself. To avoid this we will use dst-address-type=!local. And with the help of the new PCC we will divide traffic into two groups based on source and
destination addressees.
```
add action=mark-routing chain=output connection-mark=ISP1 new-routing-mark=ISP1_table
add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=ISP1 in-interface=ether_LAN new-routing-mark=ISP1_table
```
```
add action=mark-routing chain=output connection-mark=ISP2 new-routing-mark=ISP2_table
add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=ISP2 in-interface=ether_LAN new-routing-mark=ISP2_table
```
Then we need to mark all packets from those connections with a proper mark. As policy routing is required only for traffic going to the Internet, do not
forget to specify in-interface option.
```
/ip route
add check-gateway=ping disabled=no dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.10.4.1 routing-table=ISP1_table suppress-hw-
offload=no
add check-gateway=ping disabled=no dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.10.5.1 routing-table=ISP2_table suppress-hw-
offload=no
```
Create a route for each routing-mark
```
add distance=1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.10.4.1
add distance=2 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.10.5.1
```
To enable failover, it is necessary to have routes that will jump in as soon as others will become inactive on gateway failure. (and that will happen only if
check-gateway option is active)
NAT
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=ether_ISP1
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=ether_ISP2
```
As routing decision is already made we just need rules that will fix src-addresses for all outgoing packets. If this packet will leave via ether_ISP1 it will be
NATed to 10.10.4.100, if via ether_ISP2 then NATed to 10.10.5.100

## Summary
Bonding is a technology that allows aggregation of multiple ethernet-like interfaces into a single virtual link, thus getting higher data rates and providing
failover.

## Quick Setup Guide
Let us assume that we have two Ethernet interfaces on each router (Router1 and Router2) and want to get the maximum data rate between these two
routers. To make this possible, follow these steps:
```
Make sure that you do not have IP addresses on interfaces that will be enslaved for bonding interface.
Add bonding interface and IP address on the Router1:
```
```
/interface bonding add slaves=ether1,ether2 name=bond1
/ip address add address=172.16.0.1/24 interface=bond1
```
```
Do the same thing on the Router2:
```
```
/interface bonding add slaves=ether1,ether2 name=bond1
/ip address add address=172.16.0.2/24 interface=bond1
```
```
Test the link from Router1:
```
```
Interface bonding does not create an interface with a larger link speed. Interface bonding creates a virtual interface that can load balance traffic
over multiple interfaces. More details can be found in the LAG interfaces and load balancing page.
```
```
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CCR2216 routers and 88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chips support bridge hardware
offloading with bonding interfaces. Only 802.3ad and balance-xor bonding modes are hardware offloaded, other bonding modes will use
the CPU's resources. The built-in switch chip will always use Layer2+Layer3+Layer4 for a transmit hash policy, changing the transmit hash
policy manually will have no effect. See more details on CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116, CCR2216 switch chip features.
```

### 4.
```
[admin@Router1] > ping 172.16.0.2
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
0 172.16.0.2 56 64 0ms
1 172.16.0.2 56 64 0ms
2 172.16.0.2 56 64 0ms
sent=3 received=3 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```
Link monitoring
It is critical that one of the available link monitoring options is enabled. In the above example, if one of the bonded links were to fail, the bonding driver will
still continue to send packets over the failed link which will lead to network degradation. Bonding in RouterOS currently supports two schemes for
monitoring a link state of slave devices: MII and ARP monitoring. It is not possible to use both methods at the same time due to restrictions in the bonding
driver.
ARP Monitoring
ARP monitoring sends ARP queries and uses the response as an indication that the link is operational. The ARP replies are not validated, any received
packet by the slave interface will result in the slave interface considered as active. This gives assurance that traffic is actually flowing over the links. If
balance-rr and balance-xor modes are set, then the switch should be configured to evenly distribute packets across all links. Otherwise, all replies from the
ARP targets will be received on the same link which could cause other links to fail. ARP monitoring is enabled by setting three properties - link-monitoring, a
rp-ip-targets and arp-interval. The meaning of each option is described later in this article. It is possible to specify multiple ARP targets that can be useful in
High Availability setups. If only one target is set, the target itself may go down. Having additional targets increases the reliability of the ARP monitoring.
To enable ARP monitoring on Router1:
```
/interface bonding set [find name=bond1] link-monitoring=arp arp-ip-targets=172.16.0.2
```
and Router2:
```
/interface bonding set [find name=bond1] link-monitoring=arp arp-ip-targets=172.16.0.1
```
We will not change the arp-interval value in our example, RouterOS sets arp-interval to 100ms by default. Unplug one of the cables to test if the link
monitoring works correctly, you might notice some ping timeouts until arp monitoring detects link failure.

```
The bonding interface needs a couple of seconds to get connectivity with its peers.
```
```
For ARP monitoring to work properly it is not required to have any IP address on the device, ARP monitoring will work regardless of the IP
address that is set on any interface.
```
MII monitoring
MII monitoring monitors only the state of the local interface. MII Type 1 - a device driver determines whether a link is up or down. If the device driver does
not support this option then the link will appear as always up. The main disadvantage is that MII monitoring can't tell if the link can actually pass packets or
not, even if the link is detected as being up. MII monitoring is configured by setting the variables - link-monitoring and mii-interval.
To enable MII Type1 monitoring on Router1 and Router2:
```
/interface bonding set [find name=bond1] link-monitoring=mii
```
We will leave mii-interval to its default value (100ms). When unplugging one of the cables, the failure will be detected almost instantly compared to ARP
link monitoring.
Bonding modes
802.3ad
802.3ad mode is an IEEE standard also called LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol). It includes automatic configuration of the aggregates, so minimal
configuration of the switch is needed. This standard also mandates that frames will be delivered in order and connections should not see misordering of
packets. The standard also mandates that all devices in the aggregate must operate at the same speed and duplex mode.
LACP balances outgoing traffic across the active ports based on hashed protocol header information and accepts incoming traffic from any active port. The
hash includes the Ethernet source and destination address and if available, the VLAN tag, and the IPv4/IPv6 source and destination address. How this is
calculated depends on transmit-hash-policy parameter. The ARP link monitoring is not recommended, because the ARP replies might arrive only on one
slave port due to transmit hash policy on the LACP peer device. This can result in unbalanced transmitted traffic, so MII link monitoring is the
recommended option.
balance-xor
This mode balances outgoing traffic across the active ports based on the hashed protocol header information and accepts incoming traffic from any active
port. The mode is very similar to LACP except that it is not standardized and works with layer-3-and-4 hash policy. The mode can work together with
static Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interfaces.
balance-rr
If this mode is set, packets are transmitted in sequential order from the first available slave to the last. The balance-rr is the only mode that will send
packets across multiple interfaces that belong to the same TCP/IP connection. When utilizing multiple sending and multiple receiving links, packets are
often received out of order, which results in segment retransmission, for other protocols such as UDP it is not a problem if a client software can tolerate out-
of-order packets. If a switch is used to aggregate links together, then appropriate switch port configuration is required, however many switches do not
support balance-rr. Quick setup guide demonstrates the usage of the balance-rr bonding mode. As you can see, it is quite simple to set up. Balance-rr is
also useful for bonding several wireless links, however, it requires equal bandwidth for all bonded links. If the bandwidth of one bonded link drops, then the
total bandwidth of bond will be equal to the bandwidth of the slowest bonded link.
active-backup
This mode uses only one active slave to transmit packets. The additional slave only becomes active if the primary slave fails. The MAC address of the
bonding interface is presented onto the active port to avoid confusing the switch. Active-backup is the best choice in high availability setups with multiple
switches that are interconnected.
```
When ARP monitoring is used, bonding slaves will send out ARP requests without a VLAN tag, even if an IP address is set on a VLAN interface
in the same subnet as the arp-ip-targets
```
```
The layer-3-and-4 transmit hash mode is not fully compatible with LACP. More details can be found in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation
/networking/bonding.txt
```
broadcast
When ports are configured with broadcast mode, all slave ports transmit the same packets to the destination to provide fault tolerance. This mode does not
provide load balancing.
balance-tlb
This mode balances outgoing traffic by peer. Each link can be a different speed and duplex mode and no specific switch configuration is required as for the
other modes. The downside of this mode is that only MII link monitoring is supported (ARP link monitoring is ignored when configured) and incoming traffic
is not balanced. Incoming traffic will use the link that is configured as "primary".
Configuration example
Let's assume that the router has two links - ether1 max bandwidth is 10Mbps and ether2 max bandwidth is 5Mbps. The first link has more bandwidth so we
set it as a primary link:
```
/interface bonding add mode=balance-tlb slaves=ether1,ether2 primary=ether1
```
No additional configuration is required for the switch. The image above illustrates how balance-tlb mode works. As you can see router can communicate to
all the clients connected to the switch with a total bandwidth of both links (15Mbps). But as you already know, balance-tlb is not balancing incoming traffic.
In our example, clients can communicate to the router with a total bandwidth of primary link which is 10Mbps in our configuration.
balance-alb
```
The ARP monitoring in this mode will not work correctly if both routers are directly connected. In such setups, MII monitoring must be used or a
switch should be put between routers.
```
The mode is basically the same as balance-tlb but incoming IPv4 traffic is also balanced. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The
bonding driver intercepts locally generated ARP messages on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique address of one of
the slaves in the bond such that different peers use different hardware addresses. Only MII link monitoring is supported (ARP link monitoring is ignored
when configured), the additional downside of this mode is that it requires device driver capability to change MAC address. The mode is not compatible with l
ocal-proxy-arp setting.
The image above illustrates how balance-alb mode works. Compared to balance-tlb mode, traffic from clients can also use the secondary link to
communicate with the router.
Bonding monitoring
Since RouterOS 6.48 version, it is possible to monitor the bonding interface and bonding ports. For the 802.3ad bonding mode, more detailed monitoring

For active-backup mode, it controls which running interface is supposed to send and receive the traffic. For balance-tlb mode,
it controls which running interface is supposed to receive all the traffic, but for balance-alb mode, it controls which interface is

```
Selects the transmit hash policy to use for slave selection in balance-xor and 802.3ad modes
```
```
encap-2-and-3 - This policy works like the layer-2-and-3 method for distributing traffic, but uses a process to also analyze
the encapsulated packet headers. If an encapsulation protocol (like tunneling) is used, it may select the inner headers
instead of the outer ones. RouterOS can use this feature when tunnels like 6to4, GRE, GRE6, IPIP, IPIP6, PPPoE, or
PPTP are run over a bonding interface.
encap-3-and-4 - This policy works like the layer-3-and-4 method for distributing traffic, but uses a process to also analyze
the encapsulated packet headers. If an encapsulation protocol (like tunneling) is used, it may select the inner headers
instead of the outer ones. RouterOS can use this feature when tunnels like 6to4, GRE, GRE6, IPIP, IPIP6, PPPoE, or
PPTP are run over a bonding interface.
layer-2 - Uses XOR of hardware MAC addresses to generate the hash. This algorithm will place all traffic to a particular
network peer on the same slave. This algorithm is 802.3ad compliant.
layer-2-and-3 - This policy uses a combination of layer2 and layer3 protocol information to generate the hash. Uses XOR
of hardware MAC addresses and IP addresses to generate the hash. This algorithm will place all traffic to a particular
network peer on the same slave. For non-IP traffic, the formula is the same as for the layer2 transmit hash policy. This
policy is intended to provide a more balanced distribution of traffic than layer2 alone, especially in environments where a
layer3 gateway device is required to reach most destinations. This algorithm is 802.3ad compliant.
layer-3-and-4 - This policy uses upper layer protocol information, when available, to generate the hash. This allows for
traffic to a particular network peer to span multiple slaves, although a single connection will not span multiple slaves. For
fragmented TCP or UDP packets and all other IP protocol traffic, the source and destination port information is omitted.
For non-IP traffic, the formula is the same as for the layer2 transmit hash policy. This algorithm is not fully 802.3ad
compliant.

Link Monitoring
```

## Bonding EoIP tunnels over two wireless links
This is an example of aggregating multiple network interfaces into a single pipe. In particular, it is shown how to aggregate multiple virtual (EoIP) interfaces
to get maximum throughput (MT) with emphasis on availability.

## Network Diagram
Two routers R1 and R2 are interconnected via wireless links. Wireless interfaces on both sides have assigned IP addresses.

## Configuration
Bonding could be used only on OSI layer 2 (Ethernet level) connections. Thus we need to create EoIP interfaces on each of the wireless links. This is done
as follows:
on router R1:
```
/interface eoip add remote-address=10.0.1.1/24 tunnel-id=1
/interface eoip add remote-address=10.2.2.1/24 tunnel-id=2
```
and on router R2:
```
/interface eoip add remote-address=10.0.1.2/24 tunnel-id=1
/interface eoip add remote-address=10.2.2.2/24 tunnel-id=2
```
The second step is to add a bonding interface and specify EoIP interfaces as slaves:
R1:
```
/interface bonding add slaves=eoip-tunnel1,eoip-tunnel2 mode=balance-rr
```

### R2:
```
/interface bonding add slaves=eoip-tunnel1,eoip-tunnel2 mode=balance-rr
```
The last step is to add IP addresses to the bonding interfaces:
R1:
```
/ip address add address 192.168.0.1/24 interface=bonding1
```

### R2:
```
/ip address add address 192.168.0.2/24 interface=bonding1
```
Test the configuration
Now two routers are able to reach each other using addresses from the 192.168.0.0/24 network. To verify bonding interface functionality, do the following:
R1:
```
/interface monitor-traffic eoip-tunnel1,eoip-tunnel2
```

### R2:
```
/tool bandwidth-test 192.168.0.1 direction=transmit
```
You should see that traffic is distributed equally across both EoIP interfaces:
```
/int monitor-traffic eoip-tunnel1,eoip-tunnel2
received-packets-per-second: 685 685
received-bits-per-second: 8.0Mbps 8.0Mbps
sent-packets-per-second: 21 20
sent-bits-per-second: 11.9kbps 11.0kbps
received-packets-per-second: 898 899
received-bits-per-second: 10.6Mbps 10.6Mbps
sent-packets-per-second: 20 21
sent-bits-per-second: 11.0kbps 11.9kbps
received-packets-per-second: 975 975
received-bits-per-second: 11.5Mbps 11.5Mbps
sent-packets-per-second: 22 22
sent-bits-per-second: 12.4kbps 12.3kbps
received-packets-per-second: 980 980
received-bits-per-second: 11.6Mbps 11.6Mbps
sent-packets-per-second: 21 21
sent-bits-per-second: 11.9kbps 11.8kbps
received-packets-per-second: 977 977
received-bits-per-second: 11.6Mbps 11.5Mbps
sent-packets-per-second: 21 21
sent-bits-per-second: 11.9kbps 11.8kbps
-- [Q quit|D dump|C-z pause]
```
Link Monitoring
It is easy to notice that with the configuration above as soon as any individual link fails, the bonding interface throughput collapses. That's because no link
monitoring is performed, consequently, the bonding driver is unaware of problems with the underlying links. Enabling link monitoring is a must in most
bonding configurations. To enable ARP link monitoring, do the following:
R1:
```
/interface bonding set bonding1 link-monitoring=arp arp-ip-targets=192.168.0.2
```

### R2:
```
/interface bonding set bonding1 link-monitoring=arp arp-ip-targets=192.168.0.1
```


# HA Case Studies


# Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group
```
Introduction
Quick setup
MLAG settings and monitoring
```

## Introduction
MLAG (Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group) implementation in RouterOS allows configuring LACP bonds on two separate devices, while the client
device believes to be connected to the same machine. This provides a physical redundancy in case of switch failure. All CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches,
and CCR2116, CCR2216 devices can be configured with MLAG using RouterOS version 7.
Both peers establish the MLAG interfaces and update the bridge host table over peer-port using ICCP (Inter Chassis Control Protocol). RouterOS ICCP
does not require an IP configuration, but it should be isolated from the rest of the network using a dedicated untagged VLAN. This untagged VLAN can be
configured with vlan-filtering and pvid. Peer ports can also be configured as LACP bonding interfaces.
When peer-port is running and ICCP is established, the primary device election happens and system-id will be selected. The peer with the lowest pri
ority will act as the primary device. If the priorities are the same, the peer with the lowest bridge MAC address will become the primary. This system-id
is used for STP BPDU bridge identifier and LACP system ID. The MLAG requires enabled STP, RSTP or MSTP protocol. Use the same STP priority and
the same STP configuration on dual-connected bridge ports on both nodes. When MLAG bridges are elected as STP root, then both devices will show as
root bridges under the bridge monitor.
```
The MLAG is not compatible with L3 hardware offloading. When using MLAG, the L3 hardware offloading must be disabled.
```
Quick setup
in this example, CRS317 and CRS309 devices are used as MLAG peers and any device with two SFP+ interfaces can be used as an LACP client. The
SFP+1 interface is used on both peer nodes to create peer-port, and it is used for ICCP,  see a network scheme below.
Below are configuration commands to create a regular LACP bonding in RouterOS for the Client device:
```
/interface bonding
add mode=802.3ad name=bond1 slaves=sfp-sfpplus1,sfp-sfpplus2
```
Next, configure bonding interfaces for MLAG on Peer1 and Peer2 devices, use a matching mlag-id setting on both peer devices:
```
# Peer1
/interface bonding
add mlag-id=10 mode=802.3ad name=client-bond slaves=sfp-sfpplus2
```
```
# Peer2
/interface bonding
add mlag-id=10 mode=802.3ad name=client-bond slaves=sfp-sfpplus2
```
Configure bridge with enabled vlan-filtering, and add needed interfaces as bridge ports. A dedicated untagged VLAN should be applied for the inter-
chassis communication on a peer port, thus a different pvid setting is used. Below are configuration commands for Peer1 and Peer2 devices:
```
# Peer1
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=99
add bridge=bridge1 interface=client-bond
```
```
# Peer2
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 pvid=99
add bridge=bridge1 interface=client-bond
```
In this example, client-bond interfaces are using the default untagged VLAN 1 (the default pvid=1 is set). In order to send these packets over peer ports,
we need to add them as tagged VLAN 1 members. Notice that the default pvid value for the peer ports was changed in the previous step, it is important to
include the peer ports in all the VLANs that are used on other bridge ports, this includes the untagged and tagged VLANs. Below are configuration
commands for both peer devices:
```
# Peer1
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=1
```
```
# Peer2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=1
```
Last, specify bridge and peer-port to enable MLAG. Below are configuration commands for both peer devices:
```
# Peer1
/interface bridge mlag
set bridge=bridge1 peer-port=sfp-sfpplus1
```
```
# Peer2
/interface bridge mlag
set bridge=bridge1 peer-port=sfp-sfpplus1
```
Additionally, check MLAG status on peer devices and make sure that Client LACP has both interfaces active.
```
The MLAG requires enabled STP, RSTP or MSTP protocol. Use the same STP priority and the same STP configuration on dual-connected
bridge ports on both nodes.
```
```
All VLANs used for bridge slave ports must be also configured as tagged VLANs for peer-port, so that peer-port is a member of those VLANs
and can forward data.
```

port can be configured as a bonding interface.
```
```
priority (integer: 0..
128; Default:  128 )
```
```
This setting changes the priority for selecting the primary MLAG node. A lower number means higher priority. If both MLAG nodes
have the same priority, the one with the lowest bridge MAC address will become the primary device.

## Summary
This chapter describes the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) support in RouterOS.
Mostly on larger LANs dynamic routing protocols (OSPF or RIP) are used, however, there are a number of factors that may make it undesirable to use
dynamic routing protocols. One alternative is to use static routing, but if the statically configured first hop fails, then the host will not be able to
communicate with other hosts.
In IPv6 networks, hosts learn about routers by receiving Router Advertisements used by the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. ND already has a built-in
mechanism to determine unreachable routers. However, it can take up to 38 seconds to detect an unreachable router. It is possible to change parameters
and make detection faster, but it will increase the overhead of ND traffic especially if there are a lot of hosts. VRRP allows the detection of unreachable
routers within 3 seconds without additional traffic overhead.
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) provides a solution by combining a number of routers into a logical group called Virtual Router (VR). VRRP
implementation in RouterOS is based on VRRPv2 RFC 3768 and VRRPv3 RFC 5798.
It is recommended to use the same version of RouterOS for all devices with the same VRID used to implement VRRP.

## Protocol Overview
```
According to RFC authentication is deprecated for VRRP v3
```
The purpose of the VRRP is to communicate to all VRRP routers associated with the Virtual Router ID and support router redundancy through a prioritized
election process among them.
All messaging is done by IPv4 or IPv6 multicast packets using protocol 112 (VRRP). The destination address of an IPv4 packet is 224.0.0.18 and for IPv6
it is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12. The source address of the packet is always the primary IP address of an interface from which the packet is being sent. In IPv6
networks, the source address is the link-local address of an interface.
These packets are always sent with TTL=255 and are not forwarded by the router. If for any reason the router receives a packet with lower TTL, a packet
is discarded.
Each VR node has a single assigned MAC address. This MAC address is used as a source for all periodic messages sent by Master.
Virtual Router is defined by VRID and mapped set of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The master router is said to be the owner of mapped IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
There are no limits to using the same VRID for IPv4 and IPv6, however, these will be two different Virtual Routers.
Only the Master router is sending periodic Advertisement messages to minimize the traffic. A backup will try to preempt the Master only if it has the higher
priority and preemption is not prohibited.
Virtual Router (VR)
A Virtual Router (VR) consists of one Owner router and one or more backup routers belonging to the same network.
VR includes:
```
VRID configured on each VRRP router
the same virtual IP on each router
Owner and Backup configured on each router. On a given VR there can be only one Owner.
```
Virtual MAC address
VRRP automatically assigns MAC address to VRRP interface based on standard MAC prefix for VRRP packets and VRID number. The first five octets are
00:00:5E:00:01 and the last octet is configured VRID. For example, if Virtual Routers VRID is 49, then the virtual MAC address will be 00:00:5E:00:01:31.
Owner
An Owner router for a VR is the default Master router and operates as the Owner for all subnets included in the VR. Priority on an owner router must be
the highest value (255) and virtual IP is the same as real IP (owns the virtual IP address).
Master
A master router in a VR operates as the physical gateway for the network for which it is configured. The selection of the Master is controlled by priority
value. The Master state describes the behavior of the Master router. For example network, R1 is the Master router. When R1 is no longer available R2
becomes master.
Backup
VR must contain at least one Backup router. A backup router must be configured with the same virtual IP as the Master for that VR. The default priority for
Backup routers is 100. When the current master router is no longer available, a backup router with the highest priority will become a current master. Every
time when a router with higher priority becomes available it is switched to master. Sometimes this behavior is not necessary. To override it preemption
mode should be disabled.
Virtual Address
```
All VRRP routers belonging to the same VR must be configured with the same advertisement interval. If the interval does not match router will
discard the received advertisement packet.
```
```
Virtual mac addresses can not be manually set or edited.
```
```
RouterOS can not be configured as Owner. The Pure virtual IP configuration is the only valid configuration unless a non-RouterOS device is set
as the owner.
```
Virtual IP associated with VR must be identical and set on all VR nodes. All virtual and real addresses should be from the same network.
If the Master of VR is associated with multiple IP addresses, then Backup routers belonging to the same VR must also be associated with the same set of
virtual IP addresses. If the virtual address on the Master is not also on Backup a misconfiguration exists and VRRP advertisement packets will be
discarded.
All Virtual Router members can be configured so that virtual IP is not the same as physical IP. Such a virtual address can be called a floating or pure virtual
IP address. The advantage of this setup is the flexibility given to the administrator. Since the virtual IP address is not the real address of any one of the
participant routers, the administrator can change these physical routers or their addresses without any need to reconfigure the virtual router itself.
In IPv6 networks, the first address is always a link-local address associated with VR. If multiple IPv6 addresses are configured, then they are added to the
advertisement packet after the link-local address.
IPv4 ARP
The Master for a given VR responds to ARP requests with the VR's assigned MAC address. The virtual MAC address is also used as the source MAC
address for advertisement packets sent by the Master. To ARP requests for non-virtual IP, addresses router responds with the system MAC address.
Backup routers are not responding to ARP requests for Virtual IPs.
IPv6 ND
As you may know, in IPv6 networks, the Neighbor Discovery protocol is used instead of ARP. When a router becomes the Master, an unsolicited ND
Neighbor Advertisement with the Router Flag is sent for each IPv6 address associated with the virtual router.
VRRP state machine
```
RouterOS can not be configured as Owner. VRRP address and real IP address should not be the same.
```
As you can see from the diagram, each VRRP node can be in one of three states:
```
Init state
Backup state
Master state
```
Init state
The purpose of this state is to wait for a Startup event. When this event is received, the following actions are taken:
```
if priority is 255,
* for IPv4 send advertisement packet and broadcast ARP requests
* for IPv6 send an unsolicited ND Neighbor Advertisement for each IPv6 address associated with the virtual router and set target address to link-
local address associated with VR.
* transit to MASTER state;
else transit to BACKUP state.
```
Backup state
When in the backup state,
```
in IPv4 networks, a node is not responding to ARP requests and is not forwarding traffic for the IP associated with the VR.
in IPv6 networks, a node is not responding to ND Neighbor Solicitation messages and is not sending ND Router Advertisement messages for VR-
associated IPv6 addresses.
```
Routers' main task is to receive advertisement packets and check if the master node is available.
The backup router will transmit itself to the master state in two cases:
```
If priority in advertisement packet is 0;
When Preemption_Mode is set to yes and Priority in the ADVERTISEMENT is lower than the local Priority
```
After the transition to Master state node is:
```
in IPv4 broadcasts gratuitous ARP request;
in IPv6 sends an unsolicited ND Neighbor Advertisement for every associated IPv6 address.
```
In other cases, advertisement packets will be discarded. When the shutdown event is received, transit to Init state.
Master state
When the MASTER state is set, the node functions as a forwarding router for IPv4/IPv6 addresses associated with the VR.
In IPv4 networks, the Master node responds to ARP requests for the IPv4 address associated with the VR. In IPv6 networks Master node:
```
responds to ND Neighbor Solicitation message for the associated IPv6 address;
```
```
Preemption mode is ignored if the Owner router becomes available.
```
```
sends ND Router Advertisements for the associated IPv6 addresses.
```
If the advertisement packet is received by master node:
```
If priority is 0, send advertisement immediately;
If priority in advertisement packet is greater than nodes priority then transit to the backup state
If priority in advertisement packet is equal to nodes priority and primary IP Address of the sender is greater than the local primary IP Address,
then transit to the backup state
Ignore advertisement in other cases
```
When the shutdown event is received, send the advertisement packet with priority=0 and transit to Init state.
Connection tracking synchronization
Similar to different High availability features, RouterOS v7 supports VRRP connection tracking synchronization.
The VRRP connection tracking synchronization requires that RouterOS connection tracking is running. By default, connection tracking is working in auto
mode. If VRRP devices do not contain any firewall rules, you need to manually enable connection tracking:
```
/ip/firewall/connection/tracking/set enabled=yes
```
To sync connection tracking entries configure the device as follows:
```
/interface/vrrp/set vrrp1 sync-connection-tracking=yes
```
Verify configuration in the logging section:
```
16:14:06 vrrp,info vrrp1 now MASTER, master down timer
16:14:06 vrrp,info vrrp1 stop CONNTRACK
16:14:06 vrrp,info vrrp1 starting CONNTRACK MASTER
```
Connection tracking entries are synchronized only from the Master to the Backup device.
When both sync-connection-tracking and preemption-mode are enabled, and a router with higher VRRP priority becomes online, the
connections get synchronized first, and only then the router with higher priority becomes the VRRP master.
Configuring VRRP
IPv4
Setting up Virtual Router is quite easy, only two actions are required - create VRRP interface and set Virtual Routers IP address.
For example, add VRRP to ether1 and set VRs address to 192.168.1.1
```
/interface vrrp add name=vrrp1 interface=ether1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.2/24 interface=ether1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/32 interface=vrrp1
```
Notice that only the 'interface' parameter was specified when adding VRRP. It is the only parameter required to be set manually, other parameters if not
specified will be set to their defaults: vrid=1, priority=100 and authentication=none.
```
If multiple VRRP interfaces are configured between two units, then it is enough to enable sync-connection-tracking=yes on one (preferably
master) VRRP interface.
```
Before VRRP can operate correctly correct IP address is required on ether1. In this example, it is 192.168.1.2/24
IPV6
To make VRRP work in IPv6 networks, several additional options must be enabled - v3 support is required and the protocol type should be set to IPv6:
```
/interface vrrp add name=vrrp1 interface=ether1 version=3 v3-protocol=ipv6
```
Now when the VRRP interface is set, we can add a global address and enable ND advertisement:
```
/ipv6 address add address=FEC0:0:0:FFFF::1/64 advertise=yes interface=vrrp1
```
No additional address configuration is required as it is in the IPv4 case. IPv6 uses link-local addresses to communicate between nodes.
Parameters
```
Property Description
```
```
arp (disabled |
enabled | proxy-
arp | reply-only;
Default: enabled)
```
```
ARP resolution protocol mode
```
```
arp-timeout (integ
er; Default: auto)
```
```
authentication (ah
| none | simple;
Default: none)
```
```
Authentication method to use for VRRP advertisement packets.
```
```
none - should be used only in low-security networks (e.g., two VRRP nodes on LAN).
ah - IP Authentication Header. This algorithm provides strong protection against configuration errors, replay attacks, and
packet corruption/modification. Recommended when there is limited control over the administration of nodes on a LAN.
HMAC-MD5 is used.
simple - uses a clear-text password. Protects against accidental misconfiguration of routers on a local network.
```
```
group-authority (in
terface; Default: n
one)
```
```
Allows combining multiple VRRP interfaces to maintain the same VRRP status within the group. For example, VRRP
instances run on LAN and WAN networks with NAT in-between. If one VRRP instance is Master and the other is Backup on
the same device, the entire network malfunctions due to NAT failure. Grouping LAN and WAN VRRP interfaces ensures that
both are either VRRP Master or Backup.
```
```
In a VRRP group, VRRP control traffic gets sent only by the group authority. That's why in a typical WAN+LAN setup, it is
recommended to use the LAN network as the group master to keep VRRP control traffic in the internal network.
```
```
/interface vrrp
add name=vrrp-wan interface=sfp-sfpplus1 vrid=1 priority=100
add name=vrrp-lan interface=bridge1 vrid=2 priority=100
set [find] group-authority=vrrp-lan
```
```
Group-authority was previously called "group-master", "group-master" is kept for compatibility with scripts, but if both are set
only "group-authority" will be taken into account.
```
```
interface (string;
Default: )
```
```
Interface name on which VRRP instance will be running
```
```
Address on the VRRP interface must have /32 netmask if the address configured on VRRP is from the same subnet as on the router's any other
interface.
```
interval (time
[10ms..4m15s];
Default: 1s)
```
VRRP update interval in seconds. Defines how often the master sends advertisement packets.
```
mtu (integer;
Default:  1500 )
```
Layer3 MTU size. Since RouterOS v7.7, the VRRP interface always uses slave interface MTU
```
name (string;
Default: )
```
VRRP interface name
```
on-backup (string;
Default: )
```
Script to execute when the node is switched to the backup state
```
on-master (string;
Default: )
```
Script to execute when the node is switched to master state
```
on-fail (string;
Default: )
```
Script to execute when the node fails
```
password (string;
Default: )
```
Password required for authentication. Can be ignored if authentication is not used.
```
preemption-mode (
yes | no; Default: y
es)
```
Whether the master node always has the priority. When set to 'no' the backup node will not be elected to be a master until the
current master fails, even if the backup node has higher priority than the current master. This setting is ignored if the owner
router becomes available
```
priority (integer:
1..254; Default:  100
)
```
Priority of VRRP node used in Master election algorithm. A higher number means higher priority. '255' is reserved for the
router that owns VR IP and '0' is reserved for the Master router to indicate that it is releasing responsibility.
```
remote-address (I
Pv4; Default: )
```
Specifies the remote address of the other VRRP router for syncing connection tracking. If not set, the system autodetects the
remote address via VRRP. The remote address is used only if sync-connection-tracking=yes. Explicitly setting a remote
address has the following benefits:
```
```
Connection syncing starts faster since there is no need to wait for VRRP's initial message exchange to detect the remote
address.
Faster VRRP Master election.
Allows sending connection tracking data via a different network interface (e.g., a dedicated secure line between two
routers).
```
```
Sync connection tracking uses UDP port 8275.
```
v3-protocol (ipv4 |
ipv6; Default: ipv4)
```
A protocol that will be used by VRRPv3. Valid only if the version is 3.
```
version (integer
[2, 3]; Default:  3 )
```
Which VRRP version to use.
```
vrid (integer: 1..
255 ; Default:  1 )
```
Virtual Router identifier. Each Virtual router must have a unique id number
```
sync-connection-
tracking (string;
Default: no)
```
Synchronize connection tracking entries from Master to Backup device. The VRRP connection tracking synchronization
requires that RouterOS connection tracking is running.
```


# VRRP Configuration Examples

Basic Setup

Configuration
VRRP without Preemption

Testing
```

## Basic Setup
This is the basic VRRP configuration example.
```
Note
```
```
It is recommended to use the same version of RouterOS for all devices with the same VRID used to implement VRRP.
```
According to this configuration, as long as the master, R1, is functional, all traffic destined to the external network gets directed to R1. But as soon as R1
fails, R2 takes over as the master and starts handling packets forwarded to the interface associated with IP(R1). In this setup router "R2" is completely idle
during the Backup period.
Configuration
R1 configuration:
```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.10/24 interface=ether1
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=49 priority=254
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/32 interface=vrrp1
```
R2 configuration:
```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.20/24 interface=ether1
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=49
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/32 interface=vrrp1
```
Testing
First of all, check if both routers have correct flags at VRRP interfaces. On router R1 it should look like this
```
/interface vrrp print detail
0 RM name="vrrp1" mtu=1500 mac-address=00:00:5E:00:01:31 arp=enabled interface=ether1 vrid=49
priority=254 interval=1 preemption-mode=yes authentication=none password="" on-backup=""
on-master="" version=3 v3-protocol=ipv4
```
and on router R2:
```
/interface vrrp print detail
0 B name="vrrp1" mtu=1500 mac-address=00:00:5E:00:01:31 arp=enabled interface=ether1 vrid=49
priority=100 interval=1 preemption-mode=yes authentication=none password=""
on-backup="" on-master=" version=3 v3-protocol=ipv4
```
As you can see VRRP interface MAC addresses are identical on both routers. Now to check if VRRP is working correctly, try to ping the virtual address
from a client and check ARP entries:
```
[admin@client] > /ping 192.168.1.1
192.168.1.254 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=10 ms
192.168.1.254 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=8 ms
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 8/9.0/10 ms
[admin@client] /ip arp> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, H - DHCP, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS INTERFACE
...
1 D 192.168.1.1 00:00:5E:00:01:31 bridge1
```
Now unplug the ether1 cable on router R1. R2 will become VRRP master, and the ARP table on a client will not change but traffic will start to flow over the
R2 router.
Load sharing
In the basic configuration example, R2 is completely idle during the Backup state. This behavior may be considered a waste of valuable resources. In such
circumstances, the R2 router can be set as the gateway for some clients.
The obvious advantage of this configuration is the establishment of a load-sharing scheme. But by doing so R2 router is not protected by the current VRRP
setup.
To make this setup work we need two virtual routers.
```
In case VRRP is used with Reverse Path Filtering, then it is recommended that rp-filter is set to loose, otherwise, the VRRP interface
might not be reachable.
```
Configuration for V1 virtual router will be identical to a configuration in basic example - R1 is the Master and R2 is the Backup router. In V2 Master is R2
and Backup is R1.
With this configuration, we establish load-sharing between R1 and R2; moreover, we create a protection setup by having two routers acting as backups for
each other.
Configuration
R1 configuration:
```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=ether1
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=49 priority=254
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=77
/ip address add address=192.168.1.253/32 interface=vrrp1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.254/32 interface=vrrp2
```
R2 configuration:
```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.2/24 interface=ether1
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=49
/interface vrrp add interface=ether1 vrid=77 priority=254
/ip address add address=192.168.1.253/32 interface=vrrp1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.254/32 interface=vrrp2
```
VRRP without Preemption
Each time when the router with a higher priority becomes available it becomes the Master router. Sometimes this is not the desired behavior and can be
turned off by setting preemption-mode=no in VRRP configuration.
Configuration
We will be using the same setup as in the basic example. The only difference is during configuration set preemption-mode=no. It can be done easily by
modifying the existing configuration:
```
/interface vrrp set [find] preemption-mode=no
```
Testing
Try turning off the R1 router, R2 will become the Master router because it has the highest priority among available routers.
Now turn the R1 router on and you will see that the R2 router continues to be the Master even if R1 has the higher priority.

Basic examples
Check port usage, as only one instance can use the serial port simultaneously:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /port print
Flags: I - inactive
# DEVICE NAME CHANNELS USED-BY BAUD-RATE
0 serial0 1 Serial Console auto
```
In case there is one port and it is used by the console, release it from the console menu:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system console print
Flags: X - disabled, U - used, F - free
# PORT
TERM
0 U serial0 vt102
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system console disable 0
```
Adjust port settings specifically for your device (leave "auto" for LtAP mini):
```
[admin@MikroTik] /port> set 0 baud-rate=4800 parity=odd
[admin@MikroTik] /port> print detail
Flags: I - inactive
0 name="usb1" used-by="" channels=1 baud-rate=4800 data-bits=8 parity=odd stop-bits=1 flow-control=none
```
Enable GPS:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /system gps> set enable=yes port=usb1
[admin@MikroTik] /system gps> print
enabled: yes
port: usb1
channel: 0
init-channel: 0
init-string:
set-system-time: no
```
Monitor status:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /system gps> monitor
date-and-time: sep/07/2021 08:26:26
latitude: 56.969689
longitude: 24.162471
altitude: 25.799999m

```
Port and GPS settings for LtAP
```
/port set serial1 baud-rate=115200
```
```
/system gps set port=serial1 channel=0 enabled=yes
```
We have also created an in-depth article about live GPS tracking, using scripting and a web server: GPS-tracking.
Troubleshooting
Note that sometimes to make the GPS module recognized in RouterOS you need to change the baud-rate setting in the '/port' menu.
LtAP mini has a low-gain GPS antenna built-in and for a better experience, we suggest using an additional external antenna.
Switch between internal and external antennas under the GPS menu:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system gps set gps-antenna-select=external
```
On some modems with GPS support, you need to send multiple init commands for continuous GPS monitoring, for example, for Huawei cards you need to
send "AT^WPDST=1,AT^WPDGP" init string to get continuous monitoring.


# GPS-tracking using HTTP POST
The following article explains how to create a simple vehicle tracking system using the RouterOS GPS function and scripting.

## Method
This approach uses HTTP POST capability of RouterOS Fetch tool. It allows you to POST any kind of data to a webserver, right from the RouterOS
command line. Of course, you can use scripting, to fill the POST data with variables. The posted data will be written to an SQLITE3 database (file is
created, if it doesn't exist) and then, read from the database and fed into a Leaflet.js PolyLine array. This is a proof of concept example, there is no
authentication, security, or error handling.

## Requirements
```
Web server of your choice
PHP
SQLite3 module for PHP
RouterOS device with a working GPS module
RouterOS
Set GPS format in RouterOS to dd
```

## RouterOS script
You can run this script in the Scheduler tool, with an interval of 1s, to have your coordinates sent every 1 second.

### {
```
:global lat
:global lon
/system gps monitor once do={
:set $lat $("latitude")
:set $lon $("longitude")
}
tool fetch mode=http url="http://YOURSERVER.com/index.php" port=80 http-method=post http-data=("{\"lat\":\"".
$lat. "\",\"lon\":\"". $lon. "\"}") http-header-field="Content-Type: application/json"
:put ("{\"lat\":\"". $lat. "\",\"lon\":\"". $lon. "\"}")
}
```

## index.php file
Create an empty directory called sqlite_db next to the index.php file. Make sure that directory and files are writable by the group with chmod -R a+w
sqlite_db/
```
<?php
$loc = dirname(__FILE__).'/sqlite_db/coord.db';

## Introduction
Many RouterOS devices have GPS support. It allows RouterOS to determine the precise location of its GPS receiver. GPS coordinates will indicate the
latitude and the longitude values (among other parameters) of the current position.
Let's say, you have LTAP (or any other RouterOS device with GPS support) and you wish to track its location. You want the router to send this data to a
server, where the data will be stored and integrated into a map, as it is more convenient to monitor. In this guide, we will showcase how you can do that.
This scenario will utilize MQTT protocol communication with a platform called ThingsBoard.
ThingsBoard has a cloud solution and different local installation options (on different OS).
Since we've added a container feature, it became possible to also run the platform within the RouterOS. Meaning, you can build this scenario, solely on
RouterOS units → devices with GPS support that you wish to track (for example, cars equipped with LTAPs → RouterOS devices that act as MQTT
publishers), and a ThingsBoard server run within a more powerful RouterOS device (like a CHR machine → RouterOS device that acts as an MQTT broker).
If you want to choose this route (container route), make sure to pick the devices that you plan on using as a "server" carefully, because this implementation
can be heavy on RAM usage (it is suggested to have a device that has at least 2 GB RAM or 1 GB RAM with minimal load and is either ARM64 or AMD64
architecture).

## Configuration
In this guide, we will demonstrate how to configure a GPS receiver (MQTT publisher) and how to set up ThingsBoard.
In case you want to use the container feature to run the ThingsBoard instance (MQTT broker), check the guide over here. General guidelines on
ThingsBoard and MQTT configuration can be found in the guide over here. Make sure to explore both guides as they will have additional useful information.
Before proceeding, make sure that the ThingsBoard is up and running and that you can access its WEB management portal. Confirm that the MQTT port is
open and/or port-forwarded properly.

## ThingsBoard preparation
Navigate to the "Devices" menu and add a new device via the "Add new device" button → name it and create it (for example, LTAP):
```
Package requirement: gps, iot
```
```
This example will showcase access-token and one-way SSL communication via access-token scenarios for simplicity reasons, but you can use
other available options as well.
```
Click on the device you've just added, go to the "Details" section, and generate an access token under the "Manage credentials/Device Credentials" setting:
MQTT broker configuration
In case it is a local test or the broker is available through the VPN, you can use non-SSL MQTT:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=1883 username=access_token
```
Where:
```
name is the name that you wish to give to the broker and this name will be used later in the script;
address is the IP address of the broker;
port is the TCP port that the broker is listening for → for non-SSL it is typically TCP 1883;
username is dictated by the MQTT broker and, in our case, it is an "access token" that was generated in the ThingsBoard management portal.
```
In case it is public access (when you want to access the broker via its public IP address), we advise you to use SSL MQTT:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=8883 username=access_token ssl=yes
```
Where:
```
name is the name that you wish to give to the broker and this name will be used later in the script;
address is the IP address of the broker;
port is the TCP port that the broker is listening for → for SSL it is typically TCP 8883;
username is dictated by the MQTT broker, and, in our case, it is an "access token" that was generated in the ThingsBoard management portal;
ssl enables SSL MQTT communication.
```
MQTT publish
You can test MQTT publish with a static message by using the command:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="tb" topic="v1/devices/me/telemetry" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
To post GPS coordinates, import the script shown below:
```
/system/script/add dont-require-permissions=no name=mqttgps owner=admin policy="ftp,re\
boot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon" \
source=" ###Configuration###\r\
\n #Enter pre-configured broker's name within \"\":\r\
\n :local broker \"tb\"\r\
\n #Enter the topic name within \"\", per the broker's config\
uration:\r\
\n :local topic \"v1/devices/me/telemetry\"\r\
\n\r\
\n ###Variables####\r\
\n :global lat\r\
\n :global lon\r\
\n :global alt1\r\
\n :global alt2\r\
\n\r\
\n ###GPS####\r\
\n :put (\"[*] Capturing GPS coordinates...\")\r\
\n /system gps monitor once do={\r\
\n :set \$lat \$(\"latitude\");\r\
\n :set \$lon \$(\"longitude\");\r\
\n :set \$alt1 \$(\"altitude\")}\r\
\n ###remove \"meters\" from the value because JSON format wi\
ll not understand it###\r\
\n :set \$alt2 [:pick \$alt1 0 [find \$alt1 \" m\"]]\r\
\n\r\
\n :local message \\\r\
\n \"{\\\"latitude\\\":\$lat,\\\r\
\n \\\"longitude\\\":\$lon,\\\r\
\n \\\"altitude\\\":\$alt2}\"\r\
\n\r\
\n ###MQTT###\r\
\n :if (\$lat != \"none\") do={\\\r\
\n :put (\"[*] Sending message to MQTT broker...\");\r\
\n /iot mqtt publish broker=\$broker topic=\$topic message=\$\
message} else={:put (\"[*] Lattitude=none, not posting anything!\
\");:log info \"Latitude=none, not posting anything!\"}"
```
In short, the script captures GPS information, specifically the latitude, longitude, and altitude values. Then it structures a JSON message out of them. In
case, at the moment when the script is initiated, the latitude value equals anything other than "none" (equals any actual value-number) → it sends the
JSON message via MQTT to the broker named "tb". In case, the GPS data can not be captured →  "latitude" is recognized as "none" →  the script just logs
that nothing could be captured and does nothing else.
This is a very basic example. Feel free to alter the script and add your own "if" (maybe an email notification if there is no GPS signal) and additional
parameters (any other RouterOS captured value, like, maybe, its firmware version) per your requirements.
Run the script with the command:
```
/system/script/run mqttgps
[*] Capturing GPS coordinates...
date-and-time: feb/01/2023 10:39:37
latitude: 56.969862
longitude: 24.162425
altitude: 31.799999 m
speed: 1.000080 km/h
destination-bearing: none
true-bearing: 153.089996 deg. True
magnetic-bearing: 0.000000 deg. Mag
valid: yes
satellites: 6
fix-quality: 1
horizontal-dilution: 1.42
data-age: 0s
[*] Sending message to MQTT broker...
```
To automate the process, add a scheduler (to run the script, for example, every 30 seconds):
```
/system/scheduler/add name=mqttgpsscheduler interval=30s on-event="/system/script/run mqttgps"
```
Result verification
Go the the "Latest telemetry" section under your created device and confirm that the data was posted:
Data visualization using maps
ThingsBoard allows you to use Widgets to create visually appealing dashboards. In our case, we want to track our LTAP GPS coordinates, so we will need
a map widget.
Select the latitude and longitude values and click on the "Show on widget" button:
Find the "Maps" bundle and click on the "Add to dashboard":
Select an existing dashboard or create a new one and name it however you like:
Run the script via the scheduler or manually and check the result:
Now, we can install it on a moving target and track its location:

```
Quick setup example
Start with network settings - Add new connection parameters under LTE apn profile (provided by network provider):
```
/interface lte apn add name=profile1 apn=phoneprovider.net authentication=chap password=web user=web
```
Select the newly created profile for an LTE connection:
```
/interface lte set [find] apn-profiles=profile1
```
LTE interface should appear with the running (R) flag:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
0 R name="lte1" mtu=1500 mac-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA
```
If required, add NAT Masquerade for LTE Interface to get internet to the local network:
```
/ip firewall nat add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=lte1
```
After the interface is added, you can use the "info" command to see what parameters the client acquired (parameters returned depends on the LTE
hardware device):

Passthrough Example
Some LTE interfaces support the LTE Passthrough feature where the IP configuration is applied directly to the client device. In this case, modem firmware
is responsible for the IP configuration, and the router is used only to configure modem settings - APN, Network Technologies, and IP-Type. In this
configuration, the router will not get IP configuration from the modem. The LTE Passthrough modem can pass both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses if that is
supported by the modem. Some modems support multiple APNs where you can pass the traffic from each APN to a specific router interface.
Passthrough will only work for one host. The router will automatically detect the MAC address of the first received packet and use it for the Passthrough. If
there are multiple hosts on the network it is possible to lock the Passthrough to a specific MAC. On the host on the network where the Passthrough is
providing the IP a DHCP-Client should be enabled on that interface too. Note, that it will not be possible to connect to the LTE router via a public lte IP
address or from the host which is used by the passthrough. It is suggested to create an additional connection from the LTE router to the host for
configuration purposes. For example vlan interface between the LTE router and host.
To enable the Passthrough a new entry is required or the default entry should be changed in the '/interface lte apn' menu
Examples.
To configure the Passthrough on ether1:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add apn=apn1 passthrough-interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte set lte1 apn-profiles=apn1
```
To configure the Passthrough on ether1 host 00:0C:42:03:06:AB:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add apn=apn1 passthrough-interface=ether1 passthrough-mac=00:0C:42:03:06:
AB
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte set lte1 apn-profiles=apn1
```
To configure multiple APNs on ether1 and ether2:
```
Passthrough is not supported by all chipsets.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add apn=apn1 passthrough-interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add apn=apn2 passthrough-interface=ether2
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte set lte1 apn-profiles=apn1,apn2
```
To configure multiple APNs with the same APN for different interfaces:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add name=interface1 apn=apn1
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte apn add name=interface2 apn=apn1 passthrough-interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte set lte1 apn-profiles=interface1
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte set lte2 apn-profiles=interface2

```
```
phy-cellid (integer; Default: ) Physical Cell Identification (PCI) of currently used cell tower.
```
```
earfcn (integer; Default: ) Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number
```
Exact tower location as well as available bands and other information can be acquired from mobile carrier or by using online services:
CellMapper
By using those acquired variables it's possible to send the AT command to modem for locking to tower in the current format:
for R11e-LTE and R11e-LTE6
AT*Cell=<mode>,<NetworkMode>,<band>,<EARFCN>,<PCI>
where
<mode> :
0 – Cell/Frequency disabled
1 – Frequency lock enabled
2 – Cell lock enabled
<NetworkMode>
0 – GSM
1 – UMTS_TD
2 – UMTS_WB
3 – LTE
<band>
Not in use, leave this blank
<EARFCN>
earfcn from lte info
<PCI>
phy-cellid from lte info
To lock modem at previously used tower at-chat can be used:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT*Cell=2,3,,1300,384"
```
For R11e-LTE all set on locks are lost after reboot or modem reset. Cell data can be also gathered from "cell-monitor".
For R11e-LTE6 cell lock works only for the primary band, this can be useful if you have multiple channels on the same band and you want to lock it to a
specific earfcn. Note, that cell lock is not band-specific and for ca-band it can also use other frequency bands, unless you use band lock.
Use cell lock to set the primary band to the 1300 earfcn and use the second channel for the ca-band:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT*Cell=2,3,,1300,138"
```
Now it uses the earfcn: 1300 for the primary channel:
primary-band: B3@20Mhz earfcn: 1300 phy-cellid: 138
ca-band: B3@5Mhz earfcn: 1417 phy-cellid: 138
You can also set it the other way around:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT*Cell=2,3,,1417,138"
```
Now it uses the earfcn: 1417 for the primary channel:
primary-band: B3@5Mhz earfcn: 1417 phy-cellid: 138
ca-band: B3@20Mhz earfcn: 1300 phy-cellid: 138
For R11e-LTE6 modem cell lock information will not be lost after reboot or modem reset. To remove cell lock use at-chat command:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT*Cell=0"
```
for R11e-4G
AT%CLCMD=<mode>,<mode2>,<EARFCN>,<PCI>,<PLMN>
AT%CLCMD=1,1,3250,244,\"24705\"
where
<mode> :
0 – Cell/Frequency disabled
1 – Cell lock enabled
<mode2> :
0 - Save lock for first scan
1 - Always use lock
(after each reset modem will clear out previous settings no matter what is used here)
<EARFCN>
earfcn from lte info
<PCI>
phy-cellid from lte info
<PLMN>
Mobile operator code
All PLMN codes available here this variable can be also left blank
To lock the modem to the cell - modem needs to be in non operating state, the easiest way for R11e-4G modem is to add CellLock line to "modem-init"
string:
```
/interface lte set lte1 modem-init="AT%CLCMD=1,1,3250,244,\"24705\""
```
Multiple cells can also be added by providing a list instead of one tower information in the following format:
AT%CLCMD=<mode>,<mode2>,<EARFCN_1>,<PCI_1>,<PLMN_1>,<EARFCN_2>,<PCI_2>,<PLMN_2>
For example to lock to two different PCIs within the same band and operator:
```
/interface lte set lte1 modem-init="AT%CLCMD=1,1,6300,384,\"24701\",6300,385,\"24701\""
```
for Chateau LTE12, Chateau LTE18, Chateau 5G, LHG LTE18 and ATL LTE18
AT+QNWLOCK="common/4g",<num of cells>,[[<freq>,<pci>],...]
AT+QNWLOCK=\"common/4g\",1,6300,384
where
<num of cells>
number of cells to cell lock
<freq>
earfcn from lte info
<pci>
phy-cellid from lte info
Single-cell lock example:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+QNWLOCK=\"common/4g\",1,3050,448"
```
Query current configuration:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+QNWLOCK=\"common/4g\""
```
Multiple cells can also be added to the cell lock. For example to lock to two different cells:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+QNWLOCK=\"common/4g\",2,3050,448,1574,474"
```
To remove the cell lock use this at-chat command:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="at+qnwlock=\"common/4g\",0"
```
for FG621-EA
AT+GTCELLLOCK=<mode>[,<rat>,<type>,<earfcn>[,<PCI>]]
where
< mode >: integer type; 0 Disable this function 1 Enable this function 2 Add new cell to be locked
<rat>: integer type; 0 LTE 1 WCDMA
<type>: integer type; 0 Lock PCI 1 Lock frequency
<earfcn>: integer type; the range is 0-65535.
<PCI>: integer type; If second parameter value is 0, the range is 0-503 for LTE If second parameter value is 1,
the rang is 0-512 for WCDMA
Example:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+GTCELLLOCK=1,0,0,6175,176"
```
Cell Monitor
Cell monitor allows to scan available nearby mobile network cells:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface lte cell-monitor lte1
PHY-CELLID BAND PSC EARFCN RSRP RSRQ RSSI SINR
49 B20 6300 -110dBm -19.5dB
272 B20 6300 -116dBm -19.5dB
374 B20 6300 -108dBm -16dB
384 B1 150 -105dBm -13.5dB
384 B3 1300 -106dBm -12dB
384 B7 2850 -107dBm -11.5dB
432 B7 2850 -119dBm -19.5dB
```
Gathered data can be used for more precise location detection or for Cell lock.
1. Cell lock information will not be saved after a reboot or modem reset. 2. AT+QNWLOCK command can lock the cell and frequency.
Therefore, the module can be given priority to register to the locked cell, however, according to the 3gpp protocol, the module will be redirected
or handover to a cell with better signal instructions, even if it is not within the lock of the command. This phenomenon is normal.
Troubleshooting
Enable LTE logging:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system logging add topics=lte
```
Check for errors in log:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /log print
```
```
11:08:59 lte,async lte1: sent AT+CPIN?
11:08:59 lte,async lte1: rcvd +CME ERROR: 10
```
search for CME error description online,
in this case: CME error 10 - SIM not inserted
Locking band on Huawei and other modems
To lock band for Huawei modems /interface lte set lte1 band="" option can't be used.
It is possible to use AT commands to lock to the desired band manually.
To check all supported bands run the at-chat command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT^SYSCFGEX=\?"
```
```
output: ^SYSCFGEX: ("00","03","02","01","99"),((2000004e80380,"GSM850/GSM900/GSM1800/GSM1900/WCDMA BCI/WCDMA
BCII/WCDMA BCV/WCDMA BCVIII"),
(3fffffff,"All Bands")),(0-2),(0-4),((800d7,"LTE BC1/LTE BC2/LTE
BC3/LTE BC5/LTE BC7/LTE BC8/LTE BC20"),(7fffffffffffffff,"All Bands"))
OK
```
Example to lock to LTE band 7:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface lte set lte1 modem-init="AT^SYSCFGEX=\"03\",3FFFFFFF,2,4,40,,"
```
Change last part 40 to desired band specified hexadecimal value where:
4 LTE BC3
40 LTE BC7
80000 LTE BC20
7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF All bands
etc
All band HEX values and AT commands can be found in Huawei AT Command Interface Specification guide
Check if the band is locked:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT^SYSCFGEX\?"
```
```
output: ^SYSCFGEX: "03",3FFFFFFF,0,2,40
OK
```
For more information check modem manufacturers AT command reference manuals.
```
Not all modems support this feature
```
mPCIe modems with RB9xx series devices
In case your modem is not being recognized after a soft reboot, then you might need to add a delay before the USB port is initialized. This can be done
using the following command:
```
/system routerboard settings set init-delay=5s
```
Boards with USB-A port and mPCIe
Some devices such as specific RB9xx's and the RBLtAP-2HnD share the same USB lines between a single mPCIe slot and a USB-A port. If auto switch is
not taking place and a modem is not getting detected, you might need to switch manually to either use the USB-A or mini-PCIe:
```
/system routerboard usb set type=mini-PCIe
```
Avoiding tethering speed throttling
Some operators (TMobile, YOTA etc.) allow unlimited data only for the device the SIM card is used on, all other data coming from mobile hotspots or
tethering is highly limited by volume or by throughput speed. Some sources have found out that this limitation is done by monitoring TTL (Time To Live)
values from packets to determine if limitations need to be applied (TTL is decreased by 1 for each "hop" made). RouterOS allows changing the TTL
parameter for packets going from the router to allow hiding sub networks. Keep in mind that this may conflict with fair use policy.
```
IPv4 mangle rule:
/ip firewall mangle
add action=change-ttl chain=postrouting new-ttl=set:65 out-interface=lte1 passthrough=yes
IPv6 mangle rule:
/ipv6 firewall mangle
add action=change-hop-limit chain=postrouting new-hop-limit=set:65 passthrough=yes
```
More information: YOTA, TMobile
Unlocking SIM card after multiple wrong PIN code attempts
After locking the SIM card, unlock can be done through "at-chat"
Check current PIN code status:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="at+cpin\?"
```
If card is locked - unlock it by providing:
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+CPIN=\"PUK_code\",\"NEW_PIN\""
```
Replace PUK_code and NEW_PIN with matching values.
```
The command for sim slot selection changes in v6.45.1 and again in v7. Some device models like SXT, have SIM slots named "a" and "b"
instead of "up" and down"

# PPP
```
Overview
Introduction
PPP Client
PPP Client example
PPP Server
```

## Overview
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP in RouterOS is
based on RFC 1661 standard.

## Introduction
The basic purpose of PPP at this point is to transport Layer-3 packets across a Data Link layer point-to-point link.  Packets between both peers are
assumed to deliver in order.
PPP is comprised of three main components:
```
A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.
 A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection.
A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.
```
Detailed PPP packet processing in RouterOS you can see in the Packet Flow Diagram.

## PPP Client
```
/interface ppp-client
```

## PPP Client example
This is an example of how to add a client using an exposed serial port from an LTE modem.
```
/interface ppp-client add apn=yourapn dial-on-demand=no disabled=no port=usb2
```
The dial-on-demand should to be set to 'no' for a continuous connection.

## PPP Server
```
/interface ppp-server
```

Implementation details
```

## Summary
It is possible to connect the GSM modem to the RouterOS device and use it to send and receive SMS messages. RouterOS lists such modem as a serial
port that appears in the '/port print' listing. GSM standard defines AT commands for sending SMS messages and defines how messages should be
encoded in these commands. '/tool sms send' uses standard GSM AT commands to send SMS.

## Sending
```
/tool sms send
```

## Example
Sending command for ppp interface:
```
/tool sms send usb3 "20000000" \ message="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#\$%^&*(){}[]
\"'~"
```
For LTE interface use LTE interface name in the port field:
```
/tool sms send lte1 "20000000" \ message="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#\$%^&*(){}[]
\"'~"
```
```
Parameter Description
```
```
port (string) Name of port from /port that GSM modem is attached to.
```
```
phone-number (string) Recipient phone number. Allowed characters are "0123456789*#abc". If the first character is "+" then the phone
number type is set to international, otherwise, it is set to unknown.
```
```
channel (integer) Which modem channel to use for sending.
```
```
message (string) Message contents. It is encoded using GSM 7 encoding (UCS2 currently is not supported), so the message length is
limited to 160 characters (characters ^{}\[]~
```
```
smsc (string)
```
```
type (string) If set to class-0, then send class 0 SMS message. It is displayed immediately and not stored in the phone.
```
```
sms-storage (string) Select storage where to save received SMS (modem/sim)
```
```
status-report-request (yes |
no; Default: yes)
```
```
Set "no" to not request a confirmation message indicating whether a text message was successfully sent to the
recipient.
```
USSD messages
USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) messages can be used to communicate with mobile network provider to receive additional information,
enabling additional services or adding funds to prepaid cards. USSD messages can be processed by using AT commands (commands can differ or even
may be blocked on some modems).
3G or GSM network modes must be activated to use this functionality, as it's not supported under LTE only mode (R11e-LTE modem auto switches to 3G
mode to send out USSD message).
PDU (Protocol Data Unit) message and its decrypted version are printed under LTE debug logging.
Example
Check if LTE debug logging is active:
```
/system logging print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, * - default
# TOPICS ACTION PREFIX
0 * info memory
1 * error memory
2 * warning memory
3 * critical echo
```
If there is no logging entry add it by running this command:
```
/system logging add topics=lte,!raw
```
```
/system logging print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, * - default
# TOPICS ACTION PREFIX
0 * info memory
1 * error memory
2 * warning memory
3 * critical echo
4 lte,!raw memory
```
To receive account status from *245#
```
/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+CUSD=1,\"*245#\",15"
output: OK
/log print
11:51:20 lte,async lte1: sent AT+CUSD=1,"*245#",15
11:51:20 lte,async lte1: rcvd OK
11:51:23 lte,async,event +CUSD: 0,"EBB79B1E0685E9ECF4BADE9E03", 0
11:51:23 gsm,info USSD: konta atlikums
```
Receiving
RouterOS also supports receiving of SMS messages, can execute scripts, and even respond to the sender.
Before the router can receive SMS, the relevant configuration is required in the /tool sms menu. The following parameters are configurable:
```
Parameter Description
```
```
allowed-number (st
ring; Default: "")
```
```
The sender number that will be allowed to run commands, must specify the country code ie. +371XXXXXXX
```

Default: 0 )
```
```
Which modem channel to use for receiving.
```
```
keep-max-sms (int
eger; Default: 0 )
```
```
Maximum number of messages that will be saved. If you set this bigger than SIM supports, new messages will not be received.
Replaced with auto-erase parameter starting from RouterOS v6.44.6
```
```
auto-erase (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
SIM storage size is read automatically. When auto-erase=no new SMS will not be received if storage is full. Set auto-
erase=yes to delete the oldest received SMS to free space for new ones automatically. Available starting from v6.44.6
```
```
port (string;
Default: (unknown))
```
```

```
```
checking the modem for new SMS every 10s, instead of updating the inbox only after receiving the command from the modem.
Available starting from v7.16
```
Basic Example configuration to be able to view received messages:
```
/tool sms set receive-enabled=yes port=lte1
```
```

```
Other things to remember:
```
*Parameters can be put into quotes "VAR"="VAL" if necessary.
```
```
*Escaping of values is not supported (VAR="\"").
*Combined SMS are not supported, every SMS will be treated separately
* 16Bit unicode messages are not supported
* SMS are decoded with the standard GSM7 alphabet, so you can't send in other encodings, otherwise it will be decoded incorrectly
```
Examples
Wrong:
```
:cmd script mans_skripts
:cmd slepens script mans skripts
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var=
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var= a
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var=a a
```
Right:
```
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts
:cmd slepens script "mans skripts"
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var=a
:cmd slepens script mans_skripts var="a a"
```
Debugging
/tool sms send command is logging data that is written and read. It is logged with tags gsm,debug,write and gsm,debug,read For more information see
system logging.
Implementation details
AT+CMGS and AT+CMGF commands are used. Port is acquired for the duration of the command and cannot be used concurrently by another RouterOS
component. Message sending process can take a long time, it times out after a minute and after two seconds during the initial AT command exchange.


# Dual SIM Application
```
Summary
Initial settings
Roaming script example
Failover script example
Setting up scheduler
```

## Summary
The first script example shows how to switch between SIM slots in case mobile roaming is detected for LtAP mini devices. This could be useful for mobile
vehicle applications, where cars, buses or trains could drive abroad and should use two SIM cards (one for a home network, other for a roaming network).
Since RouterOS has a roaming status in the LTE monitor (displayed only when roaming) we can use this in RouterOS scripts to change SIM cards
accordingly.
The second script example shows how to switch between the SIM cards in case a mobile connection is lost on the currently selected one.
Note: Keep in mind that these are just examples of how to utilize dual SIM slots. For real-life production environments, proper testing should be carried out,
so try to optimize them and add new features according to your needs.

## Initial settings
First, make sure you have correctly set up LTE network parameters (provided by the mobile network operator) for each SIM card. You can use the default
APN profile or create two separate ones, follow this link -  LTE#Quicksetupexample. This example uses the default APN profile.
After that, enable data roaming for connecting to other countries data-providers with the following command. This allows us to keep track of roaming status.
/interface lte set [find name=lte1] allow-roaming=yes
Then, choose which SIM slots will be used for home and roaming networks. In this example, we use slot "down" for home and slot "up" for roaming
network. Use the following command to switch between active slots.
Note: command for sim slot selection changes in v6.45.1. And some device models like SXT, have SIM slots named "a" and "b" instead of "up" and down"
Command for pre 6.45.1:
/system routerboard sim set sim-slot=down
Command after 6.45.1:
/system routerboard modem set sim-slot=down
Command in RouterOS v7 version:
/interface lte settings set sim-slot=down
After changing SIM slots, LTE modem will be restarted. It can take some time (depending on the modem and board around 30 seconds) to fully initialize it,
so make sure you test your modem.

## Roaming script example
Now create a script that will run with a scheduler. This script will go through a few key points:
```
Check if the LTE interface is initialized (shown in /interface lte ), otherwise, try a power reset
Check if an LTE connection is established (the interface is in a "running" state), otherwise create a log entry and simply wait for the next scheduler
Read the currently used LTE slot and decide whether to change SIM slots based on roaming status
```
Let's call this script "roamingScript", and see below the source:

### {


# Setup and read current values, "up" SIM slot will be used for roaming, "down" for home network
:global simSlot [/system routerboard sim get sim-slot]
:global timeoutLTE 60
:global timeoutConnect 60


# Wait for LTE to initialize for maximum "timeoutLTE" seconds
:local i 0
:local isLTEinit false
:while ($i<$timeoutLTE) do={
:foreach n in=[/interface lte find] do={:set $isLTEinit true}
:if ($isLTEinit=true) do={
:set $i $timeoutLTE
}
:set $i ($i+1)
:delay 1s
}


# Check if LTE is initialized, or try power-reset the modem
:if ($isLTEinit=true) do={


# Wait for LTE interface to connect to mobile network for maximum "timeoutConnet" seconds
:local isConnected false
:set $i 0
:while ($i<$timeoutConnect) do={
:if ([/interface lte get [find name="lte1"] running]=true) do={
:set $isConnected true
:set $i $timeoutConnect
}
:set $i ($i+1)
:delay 1s
}


# Check if LTE is connected
if ($isConnected=true) do={
:local Info [/interface lte monitor lte1 once as-value]
:local isRoaming ($Info->"roaming")


# Check which SIM slot is used
:if ($simSlot="down") do={


# If "down" (home) slot, check roaming status
:if ($isRoaming=true) do={
:log info message="Roaming detected, switching to SIM UP (Roaming)"
/system routerboard sim set sim-slot=up
}
} else={


# Else "up" (roaming) slot, check roaming status
:if (!$isRoaming=true) do={
:log info message="Not roaming, switching to SIM DOWN (Home)"
/interface lte settings set sim-slot=down
}
}
} else={
:log info message="LTE interface did not connect to network, wait for next scheduler"
}
} else={
:log info message="LTE modem did not appear, trying power-reset"
/system routerboard usb power-reset duration=5s
}
}
Failover script example
Now create a script that will run with a scheduler. This script will go through a few key points:
```
Check if the LTE interface is initialized (shown in /interface lte), otherwise, try a power reset
Check if an LTE connection is established (the interface is in a "running" state), otherwise, create a log entry and simply wait for the next scheduler
Read the currently used LTE slot and make a decision whether to change SIM slots based on interface status
```
Note: Keep in mind that the SIM slot will only be changed if the current one is not able to connect to the network if you need to switch back to the main SIM
card you need to schedule another action that does it at a certain time. It is not possible to know if the other SIM card is in service without switching back to
it.
Let's call this script "failoverScript", and see below the source:

### {


# Setup and read current values
:global simSlot [/system routerboard modem get sim-slot]
:global timeoutLTE 60
:global timeoutConnect 60


# Wait for LTE to initialize for maximum "timeoutLTE" seconds
:local i 0
:local isLTEinit false
:while ($i<$timeoutLTE) do={
:foreach n in=[/interface lte find] do={:set $isLTEinit true}
:if ($isLTEinit=true) do={
:set $i $timeoutLTE
}
:set $i ($i+1)
:delay 1s
}


# Check if LTE is initialized, or try power-reset the modem
:if ($isLTEinit=true) do={


# Wait for LTE interface to connect to mobile network for maximum "timeoutConnet" seconds
:local isConnected false
:set $i 0
:while ($i<$timeoutConnect) do={
:if ([/interface lte get [find name="lte1"] running]=true) do={
:set $isConnected true
:set $i $timeoutConnect
}
:set $i ($i+1)
:delay 1s
}


# Check if LTE is connected
if ($isConnected=false) do={


# Check which SIM slot is used
:if ($simSlot="down") do={


# If "down" slot, switch to up
:log info message="LTE down, switching slot to UP"
/interface lte settings set sim-slot=up
}
:if ($simSlot="up") do={


# If "up" slot, switch to down
:log info message="LTE down, switching slot to DOWN"
/interface lte settings set sim-slot=down
}
} else={


# Else "running"
:if ($isConnected=true) do={
:log info message="LTE UP"
} else={
:log info message="LTE interface did not connect to network, wait for next scheduler"
}
}
} else={
:log info message="LTE modem did not appear, trying power-reset"
/system routerboard usb power-reset duration=5s
}
}
Setting up scheduler
Last, create your scheduler that will run the previously created script. Choose a proper scheduler interval, so two or more events do not overlap with each
other. For this example above, 3 minutes will be enough.
/system scheduler add interval=3m on-event=roamingScript name=Roaming
/system scheduler add interval=3m on-event=failoverScript name=Failover
Keep in mind that a "home" SIM card will consume some roaming data because changing SIM slots does not happen instantly.


# Multi Protocol Label Switching - MPLS
```
In This Section:
```


# MPLS Overview
```
Overview
Supported Features
```

## Overview
MPLS stands for MultiProtocol Label Switching. It kind of replaces IP routing - packet forwarding decision (outgoing interface and next-hop router) is no
longer based on fields in IP header (usually destination address) and routing table, but on labels that are attached to packet. This approach speeds up the
forwarding process because next-hop lookup becomes very simple compared to routing lookup (finding the longest matching prefix).
The efficiency of the forwarding process is the main benefit of MPLS, but it must be taken into account that MPLS forwarding disables the processing of
network layer (e.g. IP) headers, therefore no network layer-based actions like NAT and filtering can be applied to MPLS forwarded packets. Any network-
layer-based actions should be taken on ingress or egress of MPLS cloud, with the preferred way being ingress - this way, e.g. traffic that is going to be
dropped anyway does not travel through the MPLS backbone.
In the simplest form, MPLS can be thought of as improved routing - labels are distributed by means of LDP protocol for routes that are active and a labeled
packet takes the same path it would take if it was not labeled. A router that routes unlabeled packets using some route for which it has received a label
from the next hop, imposes a label on the packet, and sends it to the next hop - gets MPLS switched further along its path. A router that receives a packet
with a label it has assigned to some route changes the packet label with one received from the next hop of a particular route and sends a packet to the
next hop. Label switched path ensures delivery of data to the MPLS cloud egress point. Applications of MPLS are based on this basic MPLS concept of
label switched paths.
Another way of establishing label switching paths is traffic engineering tunnels (TE tunnels) by means of the RSVP-TE protocol. Traffic engineering tunnels
allow explicitly routed LSPs and constraint-based path selection (where constraints are interface properties and available bandwidth).
Taking into account the complexity, new protocols, and applications that MPLS introduces and the differences of concepts that MPLS adds to routed
/bridged networks, it is recommended to have an in-depth understanding of MPLS concepts before implementing MPLS in a production network. Some

# MPLS MTU, Forwarding and Label Bindings

## Label Range and TTL
From the /mpls settings menu it is possible to assign specific dynamic label range and TTL propagation. If for some reason static label mapping is
used then the dynamic range can be adjusted to exclude statically assigned label numbers from being dynamically assigned by any of the label distribution
protocols.
```
Property Description
```
```
dynamic-label-range (range of
integer[16..1048575]; Default:
16-1048575)
```
```
Range of Label numbers used for dynamic allocation. The first 16 labels are reserved for special purposes (as defined
in RFC). If you intend to configure labels statically then adjust the dynamic default range not to include numbers that
will be used in a static configuration.
```
```
propagate-ttl (yes | no; Default:
yes)
```
```
Whether to copy TTL values from IP header to MPLS header. If this option is set to no then hops inside the MPLS
cloud will be invisible from traceroutes.
```
```
allow-fast-path(yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Enable/disable MPLS fast-path support.
```

## MPLS MTU
Configuration of MPLS MTU (path MTU + MPLS tag size) is useful in cases when there is a large variety of possible MTUs along the path. Configuring
MPLS MTU to a minimum value that can pass all the hops will ensure that the MPLS packet will not be silently dropped on the devices that do not support
big enough MTU.
MPLS MTUs are configured from the /mpls interface menu.
```
[admin@rack1_b35_CCR1036] /mpls/interface> print
Flags: X - disabled; * - builtin
0 ;;; router-test
interface=ether1 mpls-mtu=1580 input=yes
```
```
1 ;;; router-test
interface=ether2 mpls-mtu=1580 input=yes
```
```
2 interface=all mpls-mtu=1500
```
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the interface
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) If set to yes then this configuration is ignored.
```
```
interface (name; Default:) Name of the interface or interface-list to match.
```
```
input (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether to allow MPLS input on the interface
```
```
mpls-mtu (integer [512..65535]; Default:  1508 ) The option represents how big packets can be carried over the interface with added MPLS labels.
```
The order of the entries is important due to the possibility that different interface lists can contain the same interface and in addition, that interface can be
referenced directly.
```
Listed entries are ordered, and the first entry (iterating from the top to the bottom) that matches the interface will be used.
```
Selection of the MPLS MTU happens in the following manner:
```
If the interface matched the entry from this table, then try to use configured MPLS MTU value
If the interface does not match any entry then consider MPLS MTU equal to L2MTU
If the interface does not support L2MTU, then consider MPLS MTU equal to L3 MTU
```
On the MPLS ingress path, MTU is chosen by min(MPLS MTU - tagsize, l3mtu). This means that on interfaces that do not support L2MTU and default L3
MTU is set to 1500, max path MTU will be 1500 - tag size (the interface will not be able to pass full IP frame without fragmentation). In such scenarios,
L3MTU must be increased by max observed tag size.
Read more on MTUs in the MTU in RouterOS article.
Forwarding Table
Entries in the /mpls forwarding-table menu show label bindings for specific routes that will be used in MPLS label switching. Properties in this menu
are read-only.

# EXP bit and MPLS Queuing

## Overview
When the MPLS label is attached to the packet, it increases packet length by 32 bits (4 bytes). These 32 bits are broken down as follows:
```
label value itself (20 bits)
EXP ("experimental") field (3 bits)
time to live field (8 bits)
bottom of stack field (1 bit)
```
The use of "experimental" bits is not specified by MPLS standards, but the most common use is to carry QoS information, similar to 802.1q priority in the
VLAN tag. Note that the EXP field is 3 bits only therefore it can carry values from 0 to 7 only, which allows having 8 traffic classes.

## EXP field treatment in RouterOS
When RouterOS receives an MPLS packet, it sets the "ingress priority" value for the packet to that carried inside the top label. Note that "ingress priority" is
not a field inside packet headers - it can be thought of as an additional mark assigned to a packet while being processed by the router. When RouterOS
labels an MPLS packet, it sets EXP bits to "priority" (not "ingress priority"!) assigned to the packet. When RouterOS switches MPLS packet, "ingress
priority" is automatically copied to "priority", this way regular MPLS switching communicates priority info over the whole label switched path.
Additional info on "ingress priority" and "priority" handling is also in WMM and VLAN priority.
Therefore what happens to the EXP field depends based on what action is taken on the packet:
```
if the packet is MPLS switched (by popping the label off the packet and pushing on the new one), the EXP field in the new label will be the same
as in the received label, because:
RouterOS sets "ingress priority" to EXP bits in the received label
Switching automatically sets "priority" to "ingress priority"
RouterOS labels the packet with a new label and sets its EXP bits to value in "priority".
if the packet is MPLS switched by using penultimate-hop-popping (the received label is popped off and no new one is pushed on), the EXP field of
received priority stays in the "priority" field of the packet and may be used by some other MAC protocol, e.g. WMM or 802.1q VLAN, for example:
RouterOS sets "ingress priority" to EXP bits in the received label
Switching automatically sets "priority" to "ingress priority"
RouterOS switches the packet to the next hop (without pushing on the label) and that happens over the VLAN interface
VLAN interface sets 802.1q priority in the VLAN header to the "priority" value of the packet.
```
Note that penultimate-hop-popping can therefore lose QoS information carried over label switched path at the last hop. In cases where this is not desirable,
penultimate-hop-popping behavior should be disabled by using the Explicit NULL label instead of the Implicit NULL label for the last hop in the label
switched path. Using an Explicit NULL label for the last hop is the default behavior for MPLS TE tunnels.
```
if a packet is supposed to be sent over label switched path (the first label will get pushed on the packet), EXP bits will be set to value in "priority",
which in turn can be set up properly using firewall rules or other means (e.g. from DSCP field in IP header)
if a packet is received for local processing, "ingress priority" is set to the EXP field of the received packet and can therefore be used to update the
DSCP field of the packet or set "priority" from "ingress priority" using firewall rules
```

## MPLS Mangle and Queuing
RouterOS firewall works only with IP traffic, which means that it is not possible to mark MPLS packets directly in mangle and limit by queues. Queuing had
to be done on ingress edge router before MPLS header is added or on egress edge router after MPLS label is removed.
Starting from ROS v7.17 MPLS Mangle is added. This allows to add packet mark based on exp bit, or change the assigned exp bit on label switching (P)
routers or on PE output after MPLS encapsulation.
This configuration is accessible from /mpls/mangle menu.

## Basic Example
Lets look at very basic example where on the label switching router (P) along the LSP we want to mark packets with exp bit 0, limit the bandwidth and
change exp bit to 3:
```
/mpls mangle
add chain=forward exp=0 set-exp=3 set-mark=m0
```
```
/queue tree
add limit-at=10M max-limit=10M name=mpls_queue packet-mark=m0 parent=sfp-sfpplus2
```
Keep in mind that MPLS packets cannot be queued with queues that are using IMQ interfaces (simple queue, queue tree global), so we need to use queue
tree with "real" interface as a parent.
MPLS Mangle table also shows matched packet count that is useful for setup debugging:
```
[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /mpls/mangle> print
Flags: X - DISABLED
Columns: CHAIN, EXP, SET-EXP, SET-MARK, PACKETS
# CHAIN EXP SET-EXP SET-MARK PACKETS
0 forward 0 3 m0 221 654
```
Another important thing is that MPLS mangle rules are not executed line by line like regular firewall mangle rules, MPLS Mangle is a set of actions that are
applied in one go.
For example, lets look at the set of rules
```
/mpls mangle
add chain=forward exp=0 set-mark=m0
add chain=forward exp=0 set-exp=3
add chain=forward exp=3 set-mark=m3
```
In this example, if incoming packet has exp bit 0, third rule will have no effect.
And once the action is set for specific exp bit it cannot be modified by another rules:
```
[admin@CCR2004_2XS_111] /mpls/mangle> add chain=forward exp=0 set-mark=m4
failure: conflicting forward set-mark rule
```

## Overview
MikroTik RouterOS implements Label Distribution Protocol (RFC 3036, RFC 5036, and RFC 7552) for IPv4 and IPv6 address families. LDP is a protocol
that performs the set of procedures and exchange messages by which Label Switched Routers (LSRs) establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) through a
network by mapping network-layer routing information directly to data-link layer switched paths.

## Prerequisites for MPLS

## "Loopback" IP address
Although not a strict requirement, it is advisable to configure routers participating in the MPLS network with "loopback" IP addresses (not attached to any
real network interface) to be used by LDP to establish sessions.
This serves 2 purposes:
```
as there is only one LDP session between any 2 routers, no matter how many links connect them, the loopback IP address ensures that the LDP
session is not affected by interface state or address changes
use of loopback address as LDP transport address ensures proper penultimate hop popping behavior when multiple labels are attached to the
packet as in the case of VPLS
```
In RouterOS "loopback" IP address can be configured by creating a dummy bridge interface without any ports and adding the address to it. For example:
```
/interface bridge add name=lo
/ip address add address=255.255.255.1/32 interface=lo
```

## IP connectivity
As LDP distributes labels for active routes, the essential requirement is properly configured IP routing. LDP by default distributes labels for active IGP
routes (that is - connected, static, and routing protocol learned routes, except BGP).
For instructions on how to set up properly IGP refer to appropriate documentation sections:
```
OSPF
Static Routing
etc
```
LDP supports ECMP routes.
You should be able to reach any loopback address from any location of your network before continuing with the LDP configuration. Connectivity can be
verified with the ping tool running from loopback address to loopback address.
Example Setup
Let's consider that we have already existing four routers setup, with working IP connectivity.
```
(lo:111.111.111.1) (lo:111.111.111.2) (lo:111.111.111.3) (lo:111.111.111.4)
|---------R1-----(111.11.0.0/24)-----R2-----(111.12.0.0/24)-----R3-----(111.13.0.0/24)-----R4---------|
```

LDP Setup
In order to start distributing labels, LDP is enabled on interfaces that connect other LDP routers and not enabled on interfaces that connect customer
networks.
On R1 it will look like this:
```
/mpls ldp
add afi=ip lsr-id=111.111.111.1 transport-addresses=111.111.111.1
/mpls ldp interface
add interface=ether2
```
Other routers are set up similarly.
R2:
```
/mpls ldp
add afi=ip lsr-id=111.111.111.2 transport-addresses=111.111.111.2
/mpls ldp interface
add interface=ether2
add interface=ether3
```
On R3:
```
/mpls ldp
add afi=ip lsr-id=111.111.111.3 transport-addresses=111.111.111.3
/mpls ldp interface
add interface=ether2
add interface=ether3
```
On R4:
```
/mpls ldp
add afi=ip lsr-id=111.111.111.4 transport-addresses=111.111.111.4
/mpls ldp interface
add interface=ether2
```
```
Note that the transport address gets set to 111.111.111.1. This makes the router originate LDP session connections with this address and also
advertise this address as a transport address to LDP neighbors.
```
After LDP sessions are established, R2 should have two LDP neighbors:
```
[admin@R2] /mpls/ldp/neighbor> print

```

```
We can observe that router has received label bindings for all routes from both its neighbors - R1 and R3.
The remote mapping table will have active mappings only for the destinations that have direct next-hop, for example, let's take a closer look at
111.111.111.4 mappings. The routing table indicates that the network 111.111.111.4 is reachable via 111.12.0.2 (R3):
```
[admin@R2] /ip/route> print where dst-address=111.111.111.4
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; A - ACTIVE; o, y - COPY
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY DISTANCE
DAo 111.111.111.4/32 111.12.0.2%ether3 110
```
And if we look again at the remote mapping table, the only active mapping is the one received from R3 with assigned label 19. This implies that when R2
when routing traffic to this network, will impose label 19.
```
17 D main 111.111.111.4 111.12.0.2 19 111.111.111.3:0
```
Label switching rules can be seen in the forwarding table:
```
[admin@R2] /mpls/forwarding-table> print
Flags: L, V - VPLS
Columns: LABEL, VRF, PREFIX, NEXTHOPS
# LABEL VRF PREFIX NEXTHOPS
0 L 16 main 10.0.0.0/8 { nh=10.155.130.1; interface=ether1 }
1 L 18 main 111.111.111.3 { label=impl-null; nh=111.12.0.2; interface=ether3 }
2 L 19 main 111.111.111.4 { label=19; nh=111.12.0.2; interface=ether3 }
3 L 20 main 111.13.0.0/24 { label=impl-null; nh=111.12.0.2; interface=ether3 }
4 L 17 main 111.111.111.1 { label=impl-null; nh=111.11.0.1; interface=ether2 }
```
If we take a look at rule number 2, the rule says that when R2 received the packet with label 19, it will change the label to new label 19 (assigned by the
R3).
As you can see from this example it is not mandatory that labels along the path should be unique.
Now if we look at the forwarding table of R3:
```
[admin@R3] /mpls/forwarding-table> print
Flags: L, V - VPLS
Columns: LABEL, VRF, PREFIX, NEXTHOPS
# LA VRF PREFIX NEXTHOPS
0 L 19 main 111.111.111.4 { label=impl-null; nh=111.13.0.2; interface=ether3 }
1 L 17 main 111.11.0.0/24 { label=impl-null; nh=111.12.0.1; interface=ether2 }
2 L 16 main 111.111.111.2 { label=impl-null; nh=111.12.0.1; interface=ether2 }
3 L 18 main 111.111.111.1 { label=17; nh=111.12.0.1; interface=ether2 }
```
Rule number 0, shows that the out label is "impl-null". The reason for this is that R3 is the last hop before 111.111.111.4 will be reachable and there is no
need to swap to any real label. It is known that R4 is the egress point for the 111.111.111.4 network (router is the egress point for directly connected
networks because the next hop for traffic is not MPLS router), therefore it advertises the "implicit null" label for this route. This tells R3 to forward traffic for
the destination 111.111.111.4/32 to R4 unlabelled, which is exactly what R3 forwarding table entry tells.
Using traceroute in MPLS networks
RFC4950 introduces extensions to the ICMP protocol for MPLS. The basic idea is that some ICMP messages may carry an MPLS "label stack object" (a
list of labels that were on the packet when it caused a particular ICMP message). ICMP messages of interest for MPLS are Time Exceeded and Need
Fragment.
MPLS label carries not only label value, but also TTL field. When imposing a label on an IP packet, MPLS TTL is set to value in the IP header, when the
last label is removed from the IP packet, IP TTL is set to value in MPLS TTL. Therefore MPLS switching network can be diagnosed by means of a
traceroute tool that supports MPLS extension.
For example, the traceroute from R4 to R1 looks like this:
```
[admin@R1] /mpls/ldp/neighbor> /tool traceroute 111.111.111.4 src-address=111.111.111.1
Columns: ADDRESS, LOSS, SENT, LAST, AVG, BEST, WORST, STD-DEV, STATUS
# ADDRESS LOSS SENT LAST AVG BEST WORST STD-DEV STATUS
1 111.11.0.2 0% 2 0.7ms 0.7 0.7 0.7 0 <MPLS:L=19,E=0>
2 111.12.0.2 0% 2 0.4ms 0.4 0.4 0.4 0 <MPLS:L=19,E=0>
3 111.111.111.4 0% 2 0.5ms 0.5 0.5 0.5 0
```
Traceroute results show MPLS labels on the packet when it produced ICMP Time Exceeded. The above means: that when R3 received a packet with
MPLS TTL 1, it had label 18 on it. This match advertised label by R3 for 111.111.111.4. In the same way, R2 observed label 17 on the packet on the next
traceroute iteration - R3 switched label 17 to label 17, as explained above. R1 received packet without labels - R2 did penultimate hop popping as
explained above.
Drawbacks of using traceroute in MPLS network
Label switching ICMP errors
One of the drawbacks of using traceroute in MPLS networks is the way MPLS handles produced ICMP errors. In IP networks ICMP errors are simply
routed back to the source of the packet that caused the error. In an MPLS network, it is possible that a router that produces an error message does not
even have a route to the source of the IP packet (for example in the case of asymmetric label switching paths or some kind of MPLS tunneling, e.g. to
transport MPLS VPN traffic).
Due to this produced ICMP errors are not routed to the source of the packet that caused the error but switched further along the label switching path,
assuming that when the label switching path endpoint will receive an ICMP error, it will know how to properly route it back to the source.
```
Action, when the label is not swapped to any real label, is called Penultimate hop popping, it ensures that routers do not have to do
unnecessary label lookup when it is known in advance that the router will have to route the packet.
```
This causes the situation, that traceroute in MPLS network can not be used the same way as in IP network - to determine failure point in the network. If the
label switched path is broken anywhere in the middle, no ICMP replies will come back, because they will not make it to the far endpoint of the label
switching path.
Penultimate hop popping and traceroute source address
A thorough understanding of penultimate hop behavior and routing is necessary to understand and avoid problems that penultimate hop popping causes to
traceroute.
In the example setup, a regular traceroute from R5 to R1 would yield the following results:
```
[admin@R5] > /tool traceroute 9.9.9.1
ADDRESS STATUS
1 0.0.0.0 timeout timeout timeout
2 2.2.2.2 37ms 4ms 4ms
mpls-label=17
3 9.9.9.1 4ms 2ms 11ms
```
compared to:
```
[admin@R5] > /tool traceroute 9.9.9.1 src-address=9.9.9.5
ADDRESS STATUS
1 4.4.4.3 15ms 5ms 5ms
mpls-label=17
2 2.2.2.2 5ms 3ms 6ms
mpls-label=17
3 9.9.9.1 6ms 3ms 3ms
```
The reason why the first traceroute does not get a response from R3 is that by default traceroute on R5 uses source address 4.4.4.5 for its probes
because it is the preferred source for a route over which next-hop to 9.9.9.1/32 is reachable:
```
[admin@R5] > /ip route print
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic,
C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,
B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit
# DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC G GATEWAY DISTANCE INTERFACE
...
3 ADC 4.4.4.0/24 4.4.4.5 0 ether1
...
5 ADo 9.9.9.1/32 r 4.4.4.3 110 ether1
...
```
When the first traceroute probe is transmitted (source: 4.4.4.5, destination 9.9.9.1), R3 drops it and produces an ICMP error message (source 4.4.4.3
destination 4.4.4.5) that is switched all the way to R1. R1 then sends ICMP error back - it gets switched along the label switching path to 4.4.4.5.
R2 is the penultimate hop popping router for network 4.4.4.0/24 because 4.4.4.0/24 is directly connected to R3. Therefore R2 removes the last label and
sends ICMP error to R3 unlabelled:
```
[admin@R2] > /mpls forwarding-table print
# IN-LABEL OUT-LABELS DESTINATION INTERFACE NEXTHOP
...
3 19 4.4.4.0/24 ether2 2.2.2.3
...
```
R3 drops the received IP packet because it receives a packet with its own address as a source address. ICMP errors produced by following probes come
back correctly because R3 receives unlabelled packets with source addresses 2.2.2.2 and 9.9.9.1, which are acceptable to a route.
Command:
```
[admin@R5] > /tool traceroute 9.9.9.1 src-address=9.9.9.5
...
```
produces expected results, because the source address of traceroute probes is 9.9.9.5. When ICMP errors are traveling back from R1 to R5, the
penultimate hop popping for the 9.9.9.5/32 network happens at R3, therefore it never gets to route packet with its own address as a source address.
Optimizing label distribution
Label binding filtering
During the implementation of the given example setup, it has become clear that not all label bindings are necessary. For example, there is no need to
exchange IP route label bindings between R1 and R3 or R2 and R4, as there is no chance they will ever be used. Also, if the given network core is
providing connectivity only for mentioned customer ethernet segments, there is no real use to distribute labels for networks that connect routers between
themselves, the only routes that matter are /32 routes to endpoints or attached customer networks.
Label binding filtering can be used to distribute only specified sets of labels to reduce resource usage and network load.
There are 2 types of label binding filters:
```
which label bindings should be advertised to LDP neighbors, configured in the /mpls ldp advertise-filter menu
which label bindings should be accepted from LDP neighbors, configured in /mpls ldp accept-filter menu
```
Filters are organized in the ordered list, specifying prefixes that must include the prefix that is tested against the filter and neighbor (or wildcard).
In the given example setup all routers can be configured so that they advertise labels only for routes that allow reaching the endpoints of tunnels. For this 2
advertise filters need to be configured on all routers:
```
/mpls ldp advertise-filter add prefix=111.111.111.0/24 advertise=yes
/mpls ldp advertise-filter add prefix=0.0.0.0/0 advertise=no
```
This filter causes routers to advertise only bindings for routes that are included by the 111.111.111.0/24 prefix which covers loopbacks (111.111.111.1/32,
111.111.111.2/32, etc). The second rule is necessary because the default filter results when no rule matches are to allow the action in question.
In the given setup there is no need to set up accept filter because by convention introduced by 2 abovementioned rules no LDP router will distribute
unnecessary bindings.
Note that filter changes do not affect existing mappings, so to take the filter into effect, connections between neighbors need to be reset. either by
removing neighbors from the LDP neighbor table or by restarting the LDP instance.
So on R2, for example, we get:
```
[admin@R2] /mpls/ldp/remote-mapping> print
Flags: I - INACTIVE; D - DYNAMIC
Columns: VRF, DST-ADDRESS, NEXTHOP, LABEL, PEER

LDP on Ipv6 and Dual-Stack links
RouterOS implements RFC 7552 to support LDP on dual-stack links.
Supported AFIs can be selected by LDP instance, as well as explicitly configured per LDP interface.
```
/mpls ldp
add afi=ip,ipv6 lsr-id=111.111.111.1 preferred-afi=ipv6
/mpls ldp interface
add interface=ether2 afi=ip
add interface=ether3 afi=ipv6
```

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.

### 5.

### 6.
The example above enables LDP instance to use IPv4 and IPv6 address families and sets the preference to IPv6 with preferred-afi parameter. LDP
interface configuration on the other hand explicitly sets that ether2 supports only IPv4 and ether3 supports only IPv6.
The main question occurs how AFI is selected when there are a mix of different AFIs and what if one of the supported AFIs flaps.
The logic behind sending hellos is as follows:
```
if an interface has only one AFI:
dual-stack element is not sent
sends hello only if there is an IP address on the interface from the corresponding AFI.
If an interface has both AFIs:
dual-stack element is always sent and contains the value from preferred-afi
sends hellos on each AFI if a corresponding address is present on the interface.
```
From all received hellos peer determines which AFI to use for connection and for which AFIs to bind and send labels. For LDP to be able to use a specific
AFI, receiving hello for that specific AFI is mandatory. Hello packet contains the transport address necessary for proper LDP operation. By comparing
received AFI addresses, is determined active/passive role.
The logic behind receiving and processing hellos is as follows:
```
if the LDP instance has only one AFI (it means that all interfaces can have only that specific AFI operational):
drop hellos from not supported AFI
ignore/forget the dual-stack element for the hello packet
the role is determined only for this one specific AFI
labels are sent only for this one specific AFI
if the LDP instance has both AFIs (interfaces can have different combinations of supported AFIs):
drop hellos from AFI that are not configured as supported on the interface.
ignore/forget the dual-stack element (preference is not taken into account) for hello packets, if an interface has only one supported AFI.
drop hello if received preference in dual-stack element does not match configured preferred-afi.
```
If there are changes in hello packets, the existing session is terminated only in case if address family used by labels is changed, otherwise, the session is
preserved.
Dual-stack element in hello packets is set only if an interface is determined to be dual-stack compatible:
```
Normally such an interface should be able to receive hellos from both AFIs,
Before proceeding LDP should wait for hello from the preferred AFI.
if hello is received only from one AFI:
if hello from preferred AFI is not received then it is considered an error.
otherwise, wait for missing hello for x seconds (x = 3 * hello-interval)
if missing hello appears within a time interval consider peer to be dual-stack
if missing hello did not appear, then consider peer to be single-stack
if missing hello appeared after the time interval then restart the session.
the dual-stack element indicates that LDP wants to distribute labels for both AFIs.
```
In summary, the following combinations of AFIs and dual-stack element (ds6) are possible assuming that preferred-afi=ipv6:
```
ipv4 - wait X seconds, if no changes, then use the IPv4 LDP session and distribute IPv4 labels
ipv4+ds6 - wait for IPv6 hello, dual-stack element indicates that there should be IPv6
ipv6 - wait X seconds, if no changes, then use the IPv6 LDP session and distribute IPv6 labels
ipv6+ds6 - use IPv6 LDP session and distribute IPv6 labels
ipv4,ipv6 - use IPv6 LDP session and distribute IPv4 and IPv6 labels
ipv4,ipv6+ds6 - use IPv6 LDP session and distribute IPv4 and IPv6 labels

# VPLS

## Summary
The virtual Private Lan Service (VPLS) interface can be considered a tunnel interface just like the EoIP interface. To achieve transparent ethernet segment
forwarding between customer sites.
Negotiation of VPLS tunnels can be done by LDP protocol or MP-BGP - both endpoints of tunnel exchange labels they are going to use for the tunnel.
Data forwarding in the tunnel happens by imposing 2 labels on packets: tunnel label and transport label - a label that ensures traffic delivery to the other
endpoint of the tunnel.
MikroTik RouterOS implements the following VPLS features:
```
VPLS LDP signaling (RFC 4762)
Cisco style static VPLS pseudowires (RFC 4447 FEC type 0x80)
VPLS pseudowire fragmentation and reassembly (RFC 4623)
VPLS MP-BGP based autodiscovery and signaling (RFC 4761)
Cisco VPLS BGP-based auto-discovery (draft-ietf-l2vpn-signaling-08)
support for multiple import/export route-target extended communities for BGP based VPLS (both, RFC 4761 and draft-ietf-l2vpn-signaling-08)
```

## VPLS Prerequisities
For VPLS to be able to transport MPLS packets, one of the label distribution protocols should be already running on the backbone, it can be LDP, RSVP-
TE, or static bindings.
Before moving forward, familiarize yourself with the prerequisites required for LDP and prerequisites for RSVP-TE.
In case, if BGP should be used as a VPLS discovery and signaling protocol, the backbone should be running iBGP preferably with route reflector/s.

## Example Setup
Let's consider that we already have a working LDP setup from the LDP configuration example.
Routers R1, R3, and R4 have connected Customer A sites, and routers R1 and R3 have connected Customer B sites. Customers require transparent L2
connectivity between the sites.

# VPLS Control Word

## Summary
VPLS allows remote sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudo-wires(PW) tunnels over a packet switching network
(PSN). Since VPLS encapsulation adds additional overhead, each interface in LSP should be able to transmit a large enough packet.
Each ethernet chipset has hardware limitations on the maximum packet size that it can transmit. Even now there are Ethernets that support only one Vlan
tag, meaning that the maximum packet size without Ethernet header and checksum (L2MTU) is 1504 bytes. Obviously, it is not enough to forward VPLS
encapsulated Ethernet frame without fragmentation (at least 1524 L2MTU support is required). See MTU in RouterOS for maximum supported L2MTUs on
RouterBOADs.
Since not even all RouterBOARDs support enough L2MTU to transmit VPLS encapsulated packet without fragmentation, RouterOS has added Pseudowire
Fragmentation and Reassembly (PWE3) support according to RFC 4623 using 4-byte Control Word (CW).

## Control Word Usage
In RouterOS, Control Word is used for packet fragmentation and reassembly inside the VPLS tunnel and is done by utilizing optional Control Word (CW).
CW is added between PW label (demultiplexor) and packet payload and adds an additional 4-byte overhead.
CW usage is controlled by the of use-control-word parameter in VPLS configuration.
As you can see Control Word is divided into 5 fields:
```
0000 - 4-bits identifies that the packet is PW (not IP)
Flags - 4bits
Frag - 2bits value that indicates payload fragmentation.
Len - 6bits
Seq - 16bits sequence number used to detect packet loss / misordering.
```
```
Reordering OOO packets are not implemented, out of order fragments will be dropped
```
According to RFC generation and processing of sequence numbers is optional.

```
Reoptimization
Path can be re-optimized manually by entering the command /interface traffic-eng reoptimize [id] (where [id] is an item number or interface
name). It allows network administrators to reoptimize the LSPs that have been established based on changes in bandwidth, traffic, management policy, or
other factors.
Let's say TE tunnel chose another path after a link failure on best path. You can verify optimization by looking at explicit-route or recorded-route v
alues if record-route parameter is enabled.
```
/interface traffic-eng monitor 0
tunnel-id: 12
primary-path-state: established
primary-path: dyn
secondary-path-state: not-necessary
active-path: dyn active-lspid: 1
active-label: 67
explicit-route: "S:192.168.55.10/32,S:192.168.55.13/32,S:192.168.55.14/32,
S:192.168.55.17/32,S:192.168.55.18/32"
recorded-route: "192.168.55.13[67],192.168.55.17[60],192.168.55.18[3]"
reserved-bandwidth: 5.0Mbps
```
Whenever the link comes back, TE tunnel will use the same path even it is not the best path (unless reoptimize-interval is configured). To fix it we can
manually reoptimize the tunnel path.
```
/interface traffic-eng reoptimize 0
```
```
/interface traffic-eng monitor 0
tunnel-id: 12
primary-path-state: established
primary-path: dyn
secondary-path-state: not-necessary
active-path: dyn
active-lspid: 2 active-label: 81
explicit-route: "S:192.168.55.5/32,S:192.168.55.2/32,S:192.168.55.1/32"
recorded-route: "192.168.55.2[81],192.168.55.1[3]"
reserved-bandwidth: 5.0Mbps
```
Notice how explicit-route and recorded-route changed to a shorter path.

## Summary
Sub-menu: /ip arp
Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses, hardware addresses must be used to transport data from one host to another. Address
Resolution Protocol is used to map OSI level 3 IP addresses to OSI level 2 MAC addresses. A router has a table of currently used ARP entries. Normally
the table is built dynamically, but to increase network security, it can be partially or completely built statically by adding static entries.

## Properties
This section describes the ARP table configuration options.
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IP;
Default: )
```
```
IP address to be mapped
```
```
interface (string
; Default: )
```
```
Interface name the IP address is assigned to
```
```
mac-address (
MAC; Default:  0
0:00:00:00:00:
00 )
```
```
MAC address to be mapped to
```
```
published (yes
| no; Default: no)
```
```
Static proxy-arp entry for individual IP addresses. When an ARP query is received for the specific IP address, the device will
respond with its own MAC address. No need to set proxy-arp on the interface itself for all the MAC addresses to be proxied. The
interface will respond to an ARP request only when the device has an active route towards the destination
```
Read-only properties:
```
Property Description
```
```
complete (yes | no) Complete flag is included in ARP entries when the ARP status is permanent, reachable, stale, probe,
or delay
```
```
dhcp (yes | no) Whether the ARP entry is added by DHCP server
```
```
disabled (yes | no) Whether the ARP entry is disabled
```
```
dynamic (yes | no) Whether the entry is dynamically created
```
```
invalid (yes | no) Whether the entry is not valid
```
```
status (delay | failed | incomplete |
permanent | probe | reachable | stale )
```
```
Shows the ARP entry state:
```
```
delay - neighbor entry validation is currently delayed
failed - ARP resolution has failed, the system was not able to obtain the MAC address for the
given IP address
incomplete - system does not have the MAC address information for the IP address, it has not
yet been resolved
permanent - ARP entry is considered permanent and will not be removed from the table, even if it
is not actively being used. This is set for manually configured ARP entries
probe - neighbor is being probed
reachable - ARP resolution is successful, and the MAC address associated with the IP address
is know, the entry is valid until the reachability timeout expires
stale - entry is still valid, but it is aged. This means that the system has not recently
communicated with the device associated with the IP address.
```
ARP Modes
It is possible to set several ARP modes on the interface configuration.
```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interface
proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originated from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which are entered as
static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore for communications to be
successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
```
Disabled
If the ARP feature is turned off on the interface, i.e., arp=disabled is used, ARP requests from clients are not answered by the router. Therefore, a static
ARP entry should be added to the clients as well. For example, the router's IP and MAC addresses should be added to the Windows workstations using
the arp command:
```
C:\> arp -s 10.5.8.254 00-aa-00-62-c6-09
```
Enabled
This mode is enabled by default on all interfaces. ARPs will be discovered automatically and new dynamic entries will be added to the ARP table.
Proxy ARP
A router with a properly configured proxy ARP feature acts as a transparent ARP proxy between different networks.
This behavior can be useful, for example, if you want to assign dial-in (ppp, pppoe, pptp) clients' IP addresses from the same address space as used on
the connected LAN.
Proxy ARP can be enabled on each interface individually with the command arp=proxy-arp:
Setup proxy ARP:
```
The default maximum number of ARP entries depends on the installed amount of RAM. It can be adjusted with the command "/ip settings
set max-neighbor-entries=x", see more details on IPv4 Settings.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface ethernet> set 1 arp=proxy-arp
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface ethernet> print
```
```
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
# NAME MTU MAC-ADDRESS ARP
0 R ether1 1500 00:30:4F:0B:7B:C1 enabled
1 R ether2 1500 00:30:4F:06:62:12 proxy-arp
```
Reply Only
If ARP property is set to reply-only on the interface, then the router only replies to ARP requests. Neighbor MAC addresses will be resolved only using
statically configured entries from the "/ip arp" menu, but there will be no need to add the router's MAC address to other hosts' ARP tables like in case if
ARP is disabled.
Local Proxy Arp
If the ARP property is set to local-proxy-arp on an interface, then the router performs proxy ARP to/from this interface only. i.e. for traffic that comes in
and goes out of the same interface. In a normal LAN, the default behavior is for two network hosts to communicate directly with each other, without
involving the router.
With local-proxy-arp enabled, the router will respond to all client hosts with the router's own interface MAC address instead of the other host's MAC
address.
E.g. If Host A (192.168.88.2/24) queries for the MAC address of Host B (192.168.88.3/24), the router would respond with its own MAC address. In other
words, if local-proxy-arp is enabled, the router would assume responsibility for forwarding traffic between Host A 192.168.88.2 and Host B
192.168.88.3. All the ARP cache entries on Hosts A and B will reference the router's MAC address. In this case, the router is performing local-proxy-
arp for the entire subnet 192.168.88.0/24.
An example for RouterOS local-proxy-arp could be a bridge setup with a DHCP server and isolated bridge ports where hosts from the same subnet
can reach each other only at Layer3 through bridge IP.
```
/interface bridge
add arp=local-proxy-arp name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 horizon=1 interface=ether4
```
Gratuitous ARP
It is possible to create Gratuitous ARP requests in RouterOS. To do so you must use the Traffic-Generator tool, below is an example of how to generate a
Gratuitous ARP request to update the ARP table on a remote device:
```
/tool traffic-generator inject interface=ether2 \
data="
ffffffffffff4c5e0c14ef78080600010800060400014c5e0c14ef780a057a01ffffffffffff0a057a010000000000000000000000000000
00000000"
```
You must change the MAC address (4c5e0c14ef78) and the IP address (0a057a01) to your router's address. The IP address and the MAC address must
be from the device that requests an ARP table update. You also need to specify through which interface (ether2) you want to send the Gratuitous ARP
request. Make sure that the receiving device supports Gratuitous ARP requests.

## Summary
MikroTik offers multiple services for your RouterBOARD devices that are connected to the Internet. These services are meant to ease the inconveniences
when configuring, setting up, controlling, maintaining, or monitoring your device. A more detailed list of available services that IP/Cloud can provide can be
found below.

## Services

## DDNS
DDNS or Dynamic DNS is a service that updates the IPv4 address for A records and the IPv6 address for AAAA records periodically. Such a service is
very useful when your ISP has provided a dynamic IP address that changes periodically, but you always need an address that you can use to connect to
your device remotely. Below you can find operation details that are relevant to the IP/Cloud's DDNS service:
```
Checks for outgoing IP address change: every 60 seconds
Waits for the MikroTik's Cloud server's response: 15 seconds
DDNS record TTL: 60 seconds
Sends encrypted packets to cloud2.mikrotik.com using UDP/15252 port
```
Since RouterOS v6.43 if your device is able to reach cloud2.mikrotik.com using IPv6, then a DNS AAAA record is going to be created for your public IPv6
address. If your device is only able to reach cloud2.mikrotik.com using IPv4, then only a DNS A record is going to be created for your public IPv4 address.
cloud.mikrotik.com is used for older RouterOS versions prior 6.44
To enable the DDNS service:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip cloud set ddns-enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] /ip cloud print
ddns-enabled: yes
ddns-update-interval: none
update-time: yes
public-address: 159.148.147.196
public-address-ipv6: 2a02:610:7501:1000::2
dns-name: 529c0491d41c.sn.mynetname.net
status: updated
```
```
Be aware that if the router has multiple public IP addresses and/or multiple internet gateways, the exact IP used for communicating with
MikroTik's Cloud server may not be as expected!
```
```
IP/Cloud requires a paid perpetual license for Cloud Hosted Router (CHR).
```
```
Cloud services are not supported on x86 systems.
```
To disable the DDNS service:
```
/ip cloud set ddns-enabled=auto
```
To manually trigger a DNS update:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip cloud force-update
```
Update time
Correct time on a device is important, it causes issues with the system's logs, breaks HTTPS connectivity to the device, tunnel connectivity, and other
issues. To have your system's clock updated, you can use NTP or SNTP, though it requires you to specify an IP address for the NTP Server. In most
cases, NTP/SNTP is not required in order to simply have a correct time set on the device, for simplicity you can use the IP Cloud's update time service.
Below you can find operation details that are relevant to the IP/Cloud's update time service:
```
Approximate time (accuracy of several seconds, depends on UDP packet latency)
Updates time after a reboot and during every DDNS update (when router's WAN IP address changes or after the force-update command is used)
Sends encrypted packets to cloud2.mikrotik.com using UDP/15252 port
Detects time-zone depending on the router's public IP address and our commercial database
```
To enable the time update service:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip cloud set update-time=yes
```
To enable automatic time zone detection:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system clock set time-zone-autodetect=yes
```
Backup
It is possible to store your device's backup on MikroTik's Cloud server. The backup service allows you to upload an encrypted backup file, download it and
apply the backup file to your device as long as your device is able to reach MikroTik's Cloud server. Below you can find operation details that are relevant
to the IP/Cloud's backup service:
```
1 free backup slot for each device
Allowed backup size: 15MB
Sends encrypted packets to cloud2.mikrotik.com using UDP/15252 and TCP/15252 port
```
```
When the service is enabled, a DNS name will be stored on MikroTik's Cloud server permanently and this DNS name will resolve to the last IP
that your RouterOS instance has sent to MikroTik's Cloud server.
```
```
Before 7.17, the default value for ddns-enabled was "no". In versions after 7.17 and including, if you want to disable DDNS, make sure to
disable the Back To Home feature first, if it was enabled, then set "ddns-enabled=auto"
```
```
As soon as you disable the service, your device sends a command to MikroTik's Cloud server to remove the stored DNS name.
```
```
To actually connect to the device using the DNS name provided by the cloud server, a user must configure the router's firewall to permit such
access from the WAN port. (Default MikroTik configuration does not permit access to services such as WebFig, WinBox, etc. from the WAN
port).
```
```
If /ip cloud update-time is set to auto, then the device's clock will be updated with MikroTik's Cloud server time (if no NTP or SNTP clien
t is enabled).
```
To create a new backup and upload it the MikroTik's Cloud server:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud upload-file action=create-and-upload password=test123!!!
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud print
0 name="cloud-20180921-162649" size=13.2KiB ros-version="6.44beta9" date=sep/21/2018 16:26:49 status="ok"
secret-download-key="AbCdEfGhIjKlM1234567890"
```
To download the uploaded backup file and save it to the device's memory:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud download-file action=download number=0
### OR
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud download-file action=download secret-download-
key=AbCdEfGhIjKlM1234567890
```
To remove the uploaded backup:
```
/system backup cloud remove-file number=0
```
To replace an existing file with a new backup file, use the following command:
```
/system/backup/cloud/upload-file action=create-and-upload replace=_your_previously_created_backup_file_
password=test123!!!
```
To upload an existing backup file (created previously):
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup save encryption=aes-sha256 name=old_backup password=test123!!!
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud upload-file action=upload src-file=old_backup.backup
[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup cloud print
0 name="cloud-20180921-164044" size=13.2KiB ros-version="6.44beta9" date=sep/21/2018 16:40:44 status="ok"
secret-download-key="AbCdEfGhIjKlM1234567890"
```
Properties
Sub-menu: /ip cloud
```
Property Description
```
```
The create-and-upload action command will create a new system's backup file, encrypt the backup file with AES using the provided
password and upload it. For upload action command the password property has no effect since the upload action command uploads only
already created system's backup files.
```
```
Warning: The secret-download-key is a unique identifier that can be used to download your encrypted backup to your other devices. Since you
can download your encrypted backup from any location and any device by using the secret-download-key, then you should try to keep this
identifier a secret. The downloaded backup is still encrypted using AES, nevertheless, make sure you are using a strong password!
```
```
Make sure that the backup was encrypted using AES, otherwise, the IP/Cloud will reject the backup upload. Since there is only 1 free backup
slot per device, then you need to remove the existing backup before uploading a new one.
```
```
Warning: When importing a backup all MAC addresses are set to the MAC addresses that the device was using. This is useful when you are
replacing a device that has failed, but this might not be desired when applying the same backup on multiple devices since it will set the same
MAC addresses on multiple devices, which can cause connectivity issues. You can always use the reset-mac-address command on each
interface to set the original MAC address back.
```
```
ddns-enabled (
yes | auto;
Default: auto)
```
```
If set to yes, then the device will send an encrypted message to MikroTik's Cloud server. The server will then decrypt the message
and verify that the sender is an authentic MikroTik device. If all is OK, then MikroTik's Cloud server will create a DDNS record for this
device and send a response to the device. Every minute the IP/Cloud service on the router will check if the WAN IP address matches
the one sent to MikroTik's Cloud server and will send an encrypted update to the cloud server if the IP address changes.
```
```
If set to auto, ddns will only be enabled if Back To Home is enabled.
```
```
ddns-update-
interval (time,
minimum 60
seconds;
Default: none)
```
```
If set DDNS will attempt to connect IP Cloud servers at the set interval. If set to none it will continue to internally check IP address
update and connect to IP Cloud servers as needed. Useful if the IP address used is not on the router itself and thus, cannot be
checked as a value internal to the router.
```
```
update-time (y
es | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
If set to yes then router clock will be set to time, provided by the cloud server IF there is no NTP or SNTP client enabled. If set to no,
then IP/Cloud service will never update the device's clock. If update-time is set to yes, Clock will be updated even when ddns-enabled

## DHCP Client

## Summary
```
/ip dhcp-client
```
The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used for the easy distribution of IP addresses in a network. The MikroTik RouterOS implementation
includes both server and client parts and is compliant with RFC 2131.
The MikroTik RouterOS DHCP client may be enabled on any Ethernet-like interface at a time. The client will accept an address, netmask, default gateway,
and two DNS server addresses. The received IP address will be added to the interface with the respective netmask. The default gateway will be added to
the routing table as a dynamic entry. Should the DHCP client be disabled or not renew an address, the dynamic default route will be removed. If there is
already a default route installed prior to the DHCP client obtaining one, the route obtained by the DHCP client would be shown as invalid.
RouterOS DHCP client asks for the following options:
```
option 1 - Subnet Mask,
option 3 - Gateway Addresses,
option 6 - DNS Server Addresses,
option 33 - Static Routes,
option 42 - NTP Server Addresses,
option 43 - Vendor Specific Information,
option 121 - Classless Static Routes,
option 138 - CAPWAP Access Controller Addresses.
```
DHCP Options
DHCP client has the possibility to set up options that are sent to the DHCP server. For example, hostname and MAC address. The syntax is the same as
for DHCP server options.
Currently, there are three variables that can be used in options:
```
HOSTNAME;
CLIENT_MAC - client interface MAC address;
CLIENT_DUID - client DIUD of the router, same as used for the DHCPv6 client. In conformance with RFC4361
```
DHCP client default options include these default Options:
```
Name code value
```
```
clientid_duid 61 0xff$(CLIENT_DUID)
```
```
clientid 61 0x01$(CLIENT_MAC)
```
```
hostname 12 $(HOSTNAME)
```
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
add-default-route (yes |
no | special-classless;
Default: yes)
```
```
Whether to install default route in routing table received from DHCP server. By default, the RouterOS client complies with
RFC and ignores option 3 if classless option 121 is received. To force the client not to ignore option 3 set special-classless.
This parameter is available in v6rc12+
```
```
yes - adds classless route if received, if not then add default route (old behavior)
special-classless - adds both classless routes if received and a default route (MS style)
```

```
```
interface (string;
Default: )
```
```
The interface on which the DHCP client will be running.
```
```
script (script; Default: ) Execute script when DHCP client obtains a new lease or loses an existing one, received gateway address or DNS server list
is changed.
Variables that are accessible for the event script:
```
```
bound - 1 - lease is added/changed; 0 - lease is removed
server-address - server address
lease-address - lease address provided by a server
interface - name of the interface on which the client is configured
gateway-address - gateway address provided by a server
vendor-specific - stores value of option 43 received from DHCP server
lease-options - an array of received options
```
```
Example >>

```
```
renew (num
bers)
```

procedure (rebind) as if it had not received an IP address yet)
```
Configuration Examples
Simple DHCP client
Add a DHCP client on the ether1 interface:
```
/ip dhcp-client add interface=ether1 disabled=no
```
After the interface is added, you can use the "print" or "print detail" command to see what parameters the DHCP client acquired:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip dhcp-client> print detail
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
0 interface=ether1 add-default-route=yes use-peer-dns=yes use-peer-ntp=yes
status=bound address=192.168.0.65/24 gateway=192.168.0.1
dhcp-server=192.168.0.1 primary-dns=192.168.0.1 primary-ntp=192.168.0.1
expires-after=9m44s
[admin@MikroTik] ip dhcp-client>
```
DHCP client status can be checked with:
```
/ip dhcp-client print detail
```
Lease script example
It is possible to execute a script when a DHCP client obtains a new lease or loses an existing one. This is an example script that automatically adds a
default route with routing-table=WAN1 and removes it when the lease expires or is removed.
```
/ip dhcp-client
add add-default-route=no dhcp-options=hostname,clientid disabled=no interface=ether2 script="{\r\
\n :local rmark \"WAN1\"\r\
\n :local count [/ip route print count-only where comment=\"WAN1\"]\r\
\n :if (\$bound=1) do={\r\
\n :if (\$count = 0) do={\r\
\n /ip route add gateway=\$\"gateway-address\" comment=\"WAN1\" routing-table=\$rmark\r\
\n } else={\r\
\n :if (\$count = 1) do={\r\
\n :local test [/ip route find where comment=\"WAN1\"]\r\
\n :if ([/ip route get \$test gateway] != \$\"gateway-address\") do={\r\
\n /ip route set \$test gateway=\$\"gateway-address\"\r\
\n }\r\
\n } else={\r\
\n :error \"Multiple routes found\"\r\
\n }\r\
\n }\r\
\n } else={\r\
\n /ip route remove [find comment=\"WAN1\"]\r\
\n }\r\
\n}\r\
\n"
```
Resolve default gateway when 'router' (option3) is from a different subnet
In some cases, administrators tend to set the 'router' option which cannot be resolved with offered IP's subnet. For example, the DHCP server offers
192.168.88.100/24 to the client, and option 3 is set to 172.16.1.1. This will result in an unresolved default route:

### # DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC GATEWAY DISTANCE

### 0 DS 0.0.0.0/0 172.16.1.1 1
```
1 ADC 192.168.88.0/24 192.168.88.100 ether1
```
```
If the interface used by the DHCP client is part of the VRF configuration, then the default route and other received routes from the DHCP server
will be added to the VRF routing table.
```
To fix this we need to add /32 route to resolve the gateway over ether1, which can be done by the running script below each time the DHCP client gets an
address
```
/system script add name="dhcpL" source={ /ip address add address=($"lease-address". "/32") network=$"gateway-
address" interface=$interface }
```
Now we can further extend the script, to check if the address already exists, and remove the old one if changes are needed
```
/system script add name="dhcpL" source={
/ip address {
:local ipId [find where comment="dhcpL address"]
:if ($ipId != "") do={
:if (!([get $ipId address] = ($"lease-address". "/32") && [get $ipId network]=$"gateway-address" )) do={
remove $ipId;
add address=($"lease-address". "/32") network=$"gateway-address" \
interface=$interface comment="dhcpL address"
}
} else={
add address=($"lease-address". "/32") network=$"gateway-address" \
interface=$interface comment="dhcpL address"
}
}
}
```
DHCPv6 Client

request procedure (rebind) as if it had not received an IP address yet)
```
Script
It is possible to add a script that will be executed when a prefix or an address is acquired and applied or expires and is removed using the DHCP client.
There are separated sets of variables that will have the value set by the client depending on prefix or address status change as the client can acquire both
and each of them can have a different effect on the router configuration.
Available variables for dhcp-client
```
pd-valid - value - 1 or 0 - if prefix is acquired and it is applied or not
pd-prefix - value ipv6/num (ipv6 prefix with mask) - the prefix inself
na-valid - value - 1 or 0 - if address is acquired and it is applied or not
na-address - value - ipv6 address - the address
```
IAID
To determine what IAID will be used, convert the internal ID of an interface on which the DHCP client is running from hex to decimal.
For example, the DHCP client is running on interface PPPoE-out1. To get internal ID use the following command:
```
[admin@t36] /interface> :put [find name="pppoe-out1"]
*15
```
Now convert hex value 15 to decimal and you get IAID=21
Configuration Examples
Simple DHCPv6 client
This simple example demonstrates how to enable dhcp client to receive IPv6 prefix and add it to the pool.
```
/ipv6 dhcp-client add request=prefix pool-name=test-ipv6 pool-prefix-length=64 interface=ether13
```
Detailed print should show status of the client and we can verify if prefix is received
```
[admin@x86-test] /ipv6 dhcp-client> print detail
Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, I - invalid
0 interface=bypass pool-name="test-ipv6" pool-prefix-length=64 status=bound
prefix=2001:db8:7501:ff04::/62 expires-after=2d23h11m53s request=prefix
```
Notice that server gave us prefix 2a02:610:7501:ff04::/62. And it should be also added to ipv6 pools
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ipv6 pool> print
Flags: D - dynamic
# NAME PREFIX REQUEST PREFIX-LENGTH
0 D test-ipv6 2001:db8:7501:ff04::/62 prefix 64
```
It works! Now you can use this pool, for example, for pppoe clients.
Use received prefix for local RA
Consider following setup:
```
ISP is routing prefix 2001:DB8::/62 to the router R1
Router R1 runs DHCPv6 server to delegate /64 prefixes to the customer routers CE1 CE2
DHCP client on routers CE1 and CE2 receives delegated /64 prefix from the DHCP server (R1).
Client routers uses received prefix to set up RA on the local interface
```
Configuration

### R1
```
/ipv6 route
add gateway=fe80::1:1%to-ISP
```
```
/ipv6 pool
add name=myPool prefix=2001:db8::/62 prefix-length=64
```
```
/ipv6 dhcp-server
add prefix-pool=myPool disabled=no interface=to-CE-routers lease-time=3m name=server1
```

### CE1
```
/ipv6 dhcp-client
add interface=to-R1 request=prefix pool-name=my-ipv6
```
```
/ipv6 address
add address=::1/64 from-pool=my-ipv6 interface=to-clients advertise=yes
```

### CE2
```
/ipv6 dhcp-client
add interface=to-R1 request=prefix pool-name=my-ipv6
/ipv6 address add address=::1/64 from-pool=my-ipv6 interface=to-clients advertise=yes
```
Check the status
After configuration is complete we can verify that each CE router received its own prefix
On server:
```
[admin@R1] /ipv6 dhcp-server binding> print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS DUID IAID SERVER STATUS
1 D 2001:db8:1::/64 0019d1393536 566 server1 bound
2 D 2001:db8:2::/64 0019d1393535 565 server1 bound
```
On client:
```
[admin@CE1] /ipv6 dhcp-client> print
Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, I - invalid
# INTERFACE STATUS REQUEST PREFIX
0 to-R1 bound prefix 2001:db8:1::/64
```
```
[admin@CE1] /ipv6 dhcp-client> /ipv6 pool print
Flags: D - dynamic
# NAME PREFIX PREFIX-LENGTH
0 D my-ipv6 2001:db8:1::/64 64
```
We can also see that IPv6 address was automatically added from the prefix pool:
```
[admin@CE1] /ipv6 address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, G - global, L - link-local
# ADDRESS FROM-POOL INTERFACE ADVERTISE 0 G 2001:db8:1::1/64 to-clients yes
..
```
And pool usage shows that 'Address' is allocating the pool
```
[admin@CE1] /ipv6 pool used> print
POOL PREFIX OWNER INFO
my-ipv6 2001:db8:1::/64 Address to-clients
```


# DHCP Server


# Summary
The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used for the easy distribution of IP addresses in a network. The MikroTik RouterOS implementation
includes both server and client parts and is compliant with RFC 2131.
The router supports an individual server for each Ethernet-like interface. The MikroTik RouterOS DHCP server supports the basic functions of giving each
requesting client an IP address/netmask lease, default gateway, domain name, DNS-server(s) and WINS-server(s) (for Windows clients) information (set
up in the DHCP networks submenu)
In order for the DHCP server to work, IP pools must also be configured (do not include the DHCP server's own IP address into the pool range) and the
DHCP networks.
It is also possible to hand out leases for DHCP clients using the RADIUS server; the supported parameters for a RADIUS server are as follows:
Access-Request:
```
NAS-Identifier - router identity
NAS-IP-Address - IP address of the router itself
NAS-Port - the ID of the interface where the DHCP server is configured. This value is the same as the IF-MIB::ifIndex
NAS-Port-Id - the name of the interface where the DHCP server is configured
NAS-Port-Type - Ethernet
Calling-Station-Id - client identifier (active-client-id)
Framed-IP-Address - IP address of the client (active-address)
Called-Station-Id - the name of DHCP server
User-Name - MAC address of the client (active-mac-address)
Password - " "
```
Access-Accept:
```
Framed-IP-Address - IP address that will be assigned to a client
Framed-Pool - IP pool from which to assign an IP address to a client
Rate-Limit - Datarate limitation for DHCP clients. Format is: rx-rate[/tx-rate] [rx-burst-rate[/tx-burst-rate] [rx-burst-threshold[/tx-burst-threshold] [rx-
burst-time[/tx-burst-time][priority] [rx-rate-min[/tx-rate-min]]]]. All rates should be numbers with optional 'k' (1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If tx-rate is
not specified, rx-rate is as tx-rate too. Same goes for tx-burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-
threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate are used as burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are
not specified, 1s is used as default. Priority takes values 1..8, where 1 implies the highest priority, but 8 - the lowest. If rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min
are not specified rx-rate and tx-rate values are used. The rx-rate-min and tx-rate-min values can not exceed rx-rate and tx-rate values.
Ascend-Data-Rate - TX/RX data rate limitation if multiple attributes are provided, first limits tx data rate, second - RX data rate. If used together
with Ascend-Xmit-Rate, specifies RX rate. 0 if unlimited
Ascend-Xmit-Rate - tx data rate limitation. It may be used to specify the TX limit only instead of sending two sequential Ascend-Data-Rate
attributes (in that case Ascend-Data-Rate will specify the receive rate). 0 if unlimited
Session-Timeout - max lease time (lease-time)
```
DHCP Server Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
add-arp (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to add dynamic ARP entry. If set to no either ARP mode should be enabled on that interface or static ARP entri
es should be administratively defined in /ip arp submenu.
```
```
address-pool (string | static-
only; Default: static-only)
```
```
IP pool, from which to take IP addresses for the clients. If set to static-only, then only the clients that have a static lease
(added in the lease submenu) will be allowed.
```
```
allow-dual-stack-queue (yes
| no; Default: yes)
```
```
Creates a single simple queue entry for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and uses the MAC address and DUID for
identification. Requires IPv6 DHCP Server to have this option enabled as well to work properly.
```
```
DHCP server requires a real interface to receive raw ethernet packets. If the interface is a Bridge interface, then the Bridge must have a real
interface attached as a port to that bridge which will receive the raw ethernet packets. It cannot function correctly on a dummy (empty bridge)
interface.
```
always-broadcast (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
Changes whether to force broadcast DHCP replies:
```
```
no - replies are sent based on the client's broadcast flag. If the server sends three consecutive offers, the third and
forth offer will be sent as a broadcast;
yes - replies are always broadcasted even when the client has not specified the broadcast flag.
```
authoritative (after-10sec-
delay | after-2sec-delay | yes
| no; Default: yes)
```
Option changes the way how a server responds to DHCP requests:
```
```
yes - replies to clients' requests for an address that is not available from this server, DHCP server will send a
negative acknowledgment (DHCPNAK);
no - DHCP server ignores clients' requests for addresses that are not available from this server;

Leases
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-server lease
DHCP server lease submenu is used to monitor and manage server leases. The issued leases are shown here as dynamic entries. You can also add static
leases to issue a specific IP address to a particular client (identified by MAC address).
Generally, the DHCP lease is allocated as follows:
```
an unused lease is in the "waiting" state
if a client asks for an IP address, the server chooses one
if the client receives a statically assigned address, the lease becomes offered, and then bound with the respective lease time
if the client receives a dynamic address (taken from an IP address pool), the router sends a ping packet and waits for an answer for 0.5 seconds.
During this time, the lease is marked testing
in the case where the address does not respond, the lease becomes offered and then bound with the respective lease time
in other cases, the lease becomes busy for the lease time (there is a command to retest all busy addresses), and the client's request remains
unanswered (the client will try again shortly)
```
A client may free the leased address. The dynamic lease is removed, and the allocated address is returned to the address pool. But the static lease
becomes busy until the client reacquires the address.
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IP; Default: 0.0.0.0) Specify IP address (or ip pool) for static lease. If set to 0.0.0.0 - a pool from the DHCP server will be used
```
```
address-list (string; Default: none) Address list to which address will be added if the lease is bound.
```
```
allow-dual-stack-queue (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Creates a single simple queue entry for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and uses the MAC address and DUID
for identification. Requires IPv6 DHCP Server to have this option enabled as well to work properly.
```
```
always-broadcast (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Changes whether to force broadcast DHCP replies:
```
```
no - replies are sent based on the client's broadcast flag. If the server sends three consecutive offers, the
third and forth offer will be sent as a broadcast;
yes - replies are always broadcasted even when the client has not specified the broadcast flag.
```
```
IP addresses assigned statically are not probed!
```
```
block-access (yes | no; Default: no
)
```
```
Block access for this client
```
```

```
```
queue-type (default, ethernet-
default, multi-queue-ethernet-
default, pcq-download-default,
synchronous-default, default-
small, hotspot-default, only-
hardware-queue, pcq-upload-
default, wireless-default)
```
```
Queue type that can be assigned to the specific lease
```
```
rate-limit (integer[/integer] [integer
[/integer] [integer[/integer] [integer
[/integer]]]];; Default: )
```
```
Adds a dynamic simple queue to limit IP's bandwidth to a specified rate. Requires the lease to be static. Format
is: rx-rate[/tx-rate] [rx-burst-rate[/tx-burst-rate] [rx-burst-threshold[/tx-burst-threshold] [rx-burst-time[/tx-burst-
time]]]]. All rates should be numbers with optional 'k' (1,000s) or 'M' (1,000,000s). If tx-rate is not specified, rx-
rate is as tx-rate too. Same goes for tx-burst-rate and tx-burst-threshold and tx-burst-time. If both rx-burst-
threshold and tx-burst-threshold are not specified (but burst-rate is specified), rx-rate and tx-rate is used as
burst thresholds. If both rx-burst-time and tx-burst-time are not specified, 1s is used as default.
```
```
routes ([dst-address/mask]
[gateway] [distance]; Default: none
)
```
```
Routes that appear on the server when the client is connected. It is possible to specify multiple routes
separated by commas. This setting will be ignored for OpenVPN.
```
```
server (string) Server name which serves this client
```
```
use-src-mac (yes | no; Default: no) When this option is set server uses the source MAC address instead of the received CHADDR to assign the
address.
```
Menu specific commands
```
check-status (id) Check the status of a given busy (status is conflict or declined) dynamic lease, and free it in case of no response
```
```
make-static (id) Convert a dynamic lease to a static one
```
Store Configuration
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-server config
Store Leases On Disk: The configuration of how often the DHCP leases will be stored on disk. If they would be saved on a disk on every lease change, a
lot of disk writes would happen which is very bad for Compact Flash (especially, if lease times are very short). To minimize writes on disk, all changes are
saved on disk every store-leases-disk seconds. Additionally, leases are always stored on disk on graceful shutdown and reboot.
Manual changes to leases - addition/removal of a static lease, removal of a dynamic lease will cause changes to be pushed for this lease to storage.
Accounting: The accounting parameter in the DHCP server configuration enables or disables accounting for DHCP leases. When accounting is enabled,
the DHCP server logs information about IP address assignments and lease renewals. This information can be useful for tracking and monitoring network
usage, analyzing traffic patterns, or generating reports on IP address allocations.
Interim-update: The interim-update parameter determines whether the DHCP server sends periodic updates to the accounting server during a lease.
These updates provide information about the lease duration, usage, and other relevant details. Enabling interim updates allows for more accurate tracking
of lease activity.
Radius-password: The radius-password parameter is used to set the password for the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server.
RADIUS is a networking protocol commonly used for providing centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for network access. When
configuring the DHCP server to communicate with a RADIUS server for authentication or accounting purposes, you need to specify the correct password
to establish a secure connection. This parameter ensures that the DHCP server can authenticate with the RADIUS server using the specified password.
Rate limiting
It is possible to set the bandwidth to a specific IPv4 address by using DHCPv4 leases. This can be done by setting a rate limit on the DHCPv4 lease itself,
by doing this a dynamic simple queue rule will be added for the IPv4 address that corresponds to the DHCPv4 lease. By using the rate-limit parameter you
can conveniently limit a user's bandwidth.
First, make the DHCPv4 lease static, otherwise, it will not be possible to set a rate limit to a DHCPv4 lease:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip dhcp-server lease print
Flags: X - disabled, R - radius, D - dynamic, B - blocked
# ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS HOST-NAME SERVER RATE-
LIMIT STATUS
0 D 192.168.88.254 6C:3B:6B:7C:41:3E MikroTik
DHCPv4_Server bound
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip dhcp-server lease make-static 0
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip dhcp-server lease print
Flags: X - disabled, R - radius, D - dynamic, B - blocked
# ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS HOST-NAME SERVER RATE-
LIMIT STATUS
0 192.168.88.254 6C:3B:6B:7C:41:3E MikroTik
DHCPv4_Server bound
```
Then you can set a rate to a DHCPv4 lease that will create a new dynamic simple queue entry:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip dhcp-server lease set 0 rate-limit=10M/10M
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /queue simple print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D name="dhcp-ds<6C:3B:6B:7C:41:3E>" target=192.168.88.254/32 parent=none packet-marks="" priority=8/8
queue=default-small/default-small limit-at=10M/10M max-limit=10M/10M burst-limit=0/0 burst-threshold=0/0 burst-
time=0s/0s
bucket-size=0.1/0.1
```
If allow-dual-stack-queue is enabled, then a single dynamic simple queue entry will be created containing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
```
For any queues to work properly, the traffic must not be FastTracked, make sure your Firewall does not FastTrack traffic that you want to limit.
```
```
By default allow-dual-stack-queue is enabled, this will add a single dynamic simple queue entry for both DCHPv6 binding and DHCPv4 lease,
without this option enabled separate dynamic simple queue entries will be added for IPv6 and IPv4.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /queue simple print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D name="dhcp-ds<6C:3B:6B:7C:41:3E>" target=192.168.88.254/32,fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66 parent=none packet-

```
RADIUS Support
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to use RADIUS to assign a rate limit per lease, to do so you need to pass the Mikrotik-Rate-Limit attribute from your
RADIUS Server for your lease. To achieve this you first need to set your DHCPv4 Server to use RADIUS for assigning leases. Below is an example of how
to set it up:
```
/radius
add address=10.0.0.1 secret=VERYsecret123 service=dhcp
/ip dhcp-server
set dhcp1 use-radius=yes
```
After that, you need to tell your RADIUS Server to pass the Mikrotik-Rate-Limit attribute. In case you are using FreeRADIUS with MySQL, then you need to
add appropriate entries into radcheck and radreply tables for a MAC address, that is being used for your DHCPv4 Client. Below is an example for table
entries:
```
INSERT INTO `radcheck` (`username`, `attribute`, `op`, `value`) VALUES
('00:0C:42:00:D4:64', 'Auth-Type', ':=', 'Accept'),
```
```
INSERT INTO `radreply` (`username`, `attribute`, `op`, `value`) VALUES
('00:0C:42:00:D4:64', 'Framed-IP-Address', '=', '192.168.88.254'),
('00:0C:42:00:D4:64', 'Mikrotik-Rate-Limit', '=', '10M'),
```
Alerts
To find any rogue DHCP servers as soon as they appear in your network, the DHCP Alert tool can be used. It will monitor the interface for all DHCP replies
and check if this reply comes from a valid DHCP server. If a reply from an unknown DHCP server is detected, an alert gets triggered:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip dhcp-server alert>/log print
00:34:23 dhcp,critical,error,warning,info,debug dhcp alert on Public:
discovered unknown dhcp server, mac 00:02:29:60:36:E7, ip 10.5.8.236
[admin@MikroTik] ip dhcp-server alert>
```
When the system alerts about a rogue DHCP server, it can execute a custom script.
As DHCP replies can be unicast, the rogue DHCP detector may not receive any offer to other DHCP clients at all. To deal with this, the rogue DHCP
detector acts as a DHCP client as well - it sends out DHCP discover requests once a minute.
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-server alert
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
alert-timeout (none | time;
Default: 1h)
```
```
Time after which the alert will be forgotten. If after that time the same server is detected, a new alert will be generated.
If set to none timeout will never expire.
```
```
interface (string; Default: ) Interface, on which to run rogue DHCP server finder.
```
```
on-alert (string; Default: ) Script to run, when an unknown DHCP server is detected.
```
```
valid-server (string; Default:
)
```
```
List of MAC addresses of valid DHCP servers.
```
Read-only properties
```
Property Description
```
```
unknown-server (string) List of MAC addresses of detected unknown DHCP servers. The server is removed from this list after alert-timeout
```
Menu specific commands
```
Property Description
```
```
The DHCP alert is not recommended on devices that are configured as DHCP clients. Since the alert itself generates DHCP discovery packets,
it can affect the operation of the DHCP client itself. Use this feature only on devices that are DHCP servers or using a static IP address.
```
```
reset-alert (id) Clear all alerts on an interface
```
DHCP Options
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-server option
With the help of the DHCP Option list, it is possible to define additional custom options for DHCP Server to advertise. Option precedence is as follows:
```
radius,
lease,
server,
network.
```
This is the order in which the client option request will be filled in.
According to the DHCP protocol, a parameter is returned to the DHCP client only if it requests this parameter, specifying the respective code in the DHCP
request Parameter-List (code 55) attribute. If the code is not included in the Parameter-List attribute, the DHCP server will not send it to the DHCP client,
but since RouterOS v7.1rc5 it is possible to force the DHCP option from the server-side even if the DHCP-client does not request such parameter:
```
ip/dhcp-server/option/set force=yes
```
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
code (integer:1..254;
Default: )
```
```
dhcp option code. All codes are available at http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of the option
```
```
value (string; Default: ) Parameter's value. Available data types for options are:
```
```
'test' -> ASCII to Hex 0x74657374
'10.10.10.10' -> Unicode IP to Hex 0x0a0a0a0a
s'10.10.10.10' -> ASCII to hex 0x31302e31302e31302e3130
s'160' -> ASCII to hex 0x313630
'10' -> Decimal to Hex 0x0a
0x0a0a -> No conversion
$(VARIABLE) -> hardcoded values
```
```
RouterOS has predefined variables that can be used:
```
```
HOSTNAME - client hostname
RADIUS_MT_STR1 - from radius MT attr nr. 24
RADIUS_MT_STR2 - from radius MT attr nr. 25
REMOTE_ID - agent remote-id
NETWORK_GATEWAY - the first gateway from '/ip dhcp-server network', note that this option won't work if
used from lease
```
```
Now it is also possible to combine data types into one, for example: "0x01'vards'$(HOSTNAME)"
```
```
For example if HOSTNAME is 'kvm', then raw value will be 0x0176617264736b766d.
```
```
raw-value (HEX string ) Read-only field which shows raw DHCP option value (the format actually sent out)
```
DHCP Option Sets
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-server option sets
This menu allows combining multiple options in option sets, which later can be used to override the default DHCP server option set.
Example
Classless Route
A classless route adds a specified route in the clients routing table. In our example, it will add
```
dst-address=160.0.0.0/24 gateway=10.1.101.1
dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.1.101.1
```
According to RFC 3442: The first part is the netmask ("18" = netmask /24). Second part is significant part of destination network ("A00000" = 160.0.0).
Third part is IP address of gateway ("0A016501" = 10.1.101.1). Then There are parts of the default route, destination netmask (0x00 = 0.0.0.0/0) followed
by default route (0x0A016501 = 10.1.101.1)
```
/ip dhcp-server option
add code=121 name=classless value=0x18A000000A016501000A016501
/ip dhcp-server network
set 0 dhcp-option=classless
```
Result:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip route> print
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic, C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf,
m - mme, B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit
# DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC GATEWAY DISTANCE
0 ADS 0.0.0.0/0 10.1.101.1 0
1 ADS 160.0.0.0/24 10.1.101.1 0
```
A much more robust way would be to use built-in variables, the previous example can be rewritten as:
```
/ip dhcp-server option
add name=classless code=121 value="0x18A00000\$(NETWORK_GATEWAY)0x00\$(NETWORK_GATEWAY)"
```
Auto proxy config
```
/ip dhcp-server option
add code=252 name=auto-proxy-config value="'https://autoconfig.something.lv/wpad.dat'"
```
Vendor Classes
RouterOS support vendor class, ID matcher. The vendor class is used by DHCP clients to optionally identify the vendor and configuration.
Example
In the following configuration example, we will give an IP address from a particular pool for an Android-based mobile phone. We will use the RouterBOARD
with a default configuration
```
/ip pool
add name=default-dhcp ranges=192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254
add name=pool-for-VID ranges=172.16.16.10-172.16.16.120
```
Configure vendor-class-id matcher. DHCP server configuration remains default in this example
```
Vendor-class-id matcher changes to generic matcher since RouterOS v7.4beta4.
```
```
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=default-dhcp disabled=no interface=bridge name=defconf
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.88.0/24 comment=defconf gateway=192.168.88.1
/ip dhcp-server vendor-class-id
add address-pool=pool-for-VID name=samsung server=defconf vid=android-dhcp-9
```
Connect your mobile phone to the device to receive an IP address from the 172.16.16.0 network
```
[admin@mikrotik] > /ip dhcp-server lease print detail
Flags: X - disabled, R - radius, D - dynamic, B - blocked

If you do not know your devices Vendor Class ID, you can turn on DHCP debug logs with /system logging add topics=dhcp. Then in the logging
entries, you will see Class-ID

```
Generic matcher
Since RouterOS 7.4beta4 (2022-Jun-15 14:04) the vendor-id matcher is converted to a generic matcher. The generic matcher allows matching any of the
DHCP options.
And an example to match DHCP option 60 similar to vendor-id-class matcher:
```
/ip dhcp-server matcher
add address-pool=pool1 code=60 name=test value=android-dhcp-11
```
Match the client-id with option 61 configured as hex value:
```
/ip dhcp-server matcher
add address-pool=pool1 code=61 name=test value=0x016c3b6bed8364
```
Match the code 12 using the string:
```
/ip dhcp-server matcher
add address-pool=testpool code=12 name=test server=dhcp1 value="MikroTik"
```
Since 7.16beta3 there is matching-type option available, matching-type=exact will match the exact value that is defined, while substring will
match the defined value in the whole option string, substring match can match values at the start, middle, or end of the string. The default behavior is ma
tching-type=exact before 7.16beta3 there was no option for substring matching.
Substring matching is useful in cases where value can change depending on the end device, for example, if the class-identifier sent by the device contains
not only vendor information, but also exact MAC or other additional information.
Configuration Examples
Setup
To simply configure DHCP server you can use a setup command.
First, you configure an IP address on the interface:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=ether3 disabled=no
```
Then you use setup a command which will automatically ask necessary parameters:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip dhcp-server setup
Select interface to run DHCP server on
```
```
dhcp server interface: ether3
Select network for DHCP addresses
```
```
dhcp address space: 192.168.88.0/24
Select gateway for given network
```
```
gateway for dhcp network: 192.168.88.1
Select pool of ip addresses given out by DHCP server
```
```
addresses to give out: 192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254
Select DNS servers
```
```
dns servers: 10.155.126.1,10.155.0.1,
Select lease time
```
```
lease time: 10m
```
That is all. You have configured an active DHCP server.
Manual configuration
```
It's possible to define two substring matches for the same option, for example, one that matches "ABC" and another one that matches "ABCDE",
if there is a DHCP option with the value of "ABCDEF", both entries would match it, but the matcher that will get applied will be selected
randomly.
```
To configure the DHCP server manually to respond to local requests you have to configure the following:
```
An IP pool for addresses to be given out, make sure that your gateway/DHCP server address is not part of the pool.
```
```
/ip pool add name=dhcp_pool0 ranges=192.168.88.2-192.168.88.254
```
```
A network indicating subnets that DHCP-server will lease addresses from, among other information, like a gateway, DNS-server, NTP-server,
DHCP options, etc.
```
```
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 dns-server=192.168.88.1 gateway=192.168.88.1
```
```
In our case, the device itself is serving as the gateway, so we'll add the address to the bridge interface:
```
```
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge1 network=192.168.88.0
```
```
And finally, add DHCP Server, here we will add the previously created address pool, and specify on which interface the DHCP server should work
on
```
```
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool0 disabled=no interface=bridge1 name=dhcp1
```


# DHCPv6 Server

## Summary
Standards: RFC 3315, RFC 3633
Single DUID is used for client and server identification, only IAID will vary between clients corresponding to their assigned interface.
Client binding creates a dynamic pool with a timeout set to binding's expiration time (note that now dynamic pools can have a timeout), which will be
updated every time binding gets renewed.
When a client is bound to a prefix, the DHCP server adds routing information to know how to reach the assigned prefix.
Client bindings in the server do not show MAC address anymore (as it was in v5.8), DUID (hex) and IAID are used instead. After upgrade, MAC addresses
will be converted to DUIDs automatically, but due to unknown DUID type and unknown IAID, they should be further updated by the user;

waiting - Shown for static bindings if it is not used. For dynamic bindings this status is shown if it was used previously, the server
will wait 10 minutes to allow an old client to get this binding, otherwise binding will be cleared and prefix will be offered to other
clients.
offered - if solicit message was received, and the server responded with advertise a message, but the request was not received.
During this state client have 2 minutes to get this binding, otherwise, it is freed or changed status to waiting for static bindings.
bound - currently bound.
```
For example, dynamically assigned /62 prefix
```
[admin@RB493G] /ipv6 dhcp-server binding> print detail

```
Menu specific commands
```
Property Description
```
```
make-static () Set dynamic binding as static.
```
Rate limiting
It is possible to set the bandwidth to a specific IPv6 address by using DHCPv6 bindings. This can be done by setting a rate limit on the DHCPv6 binding
itself, by doing this a dynamic simple queue rule will be added for the IPv6 address that corresponds to the DHCPv6 binding. By using the rate-limit
the parameter you can conveniently limit a user's bandwidth.
First, make the DHCPv6 binding static, otherwise, it will not be possible to set a rate limit to a DHCPv6 binding:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ipv6 dhcp-server binding print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS DUID SERVER STATUS
0 D fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66 0x6c3b6b7c413e DHCPv6_Server bound
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ipv6 dhcp-server binding make-static 0
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ipv6 dhcp-server binding print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS DUID SERVER STATUS
0 fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66 0x6c3b6b7c413e DHCPv6_Server bound
```
Then you need can set a rate to a DHCPv6 binding that will create a new dynamic simple queue entry:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ipv6 dhcp-server binding set 0 rate-limit=10M/10
[admin@MikroTik] > /queue simple print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D name="dhcp<6c3b6b7c413e fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66>" target=fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66 parent=none packet-
marks="" priority=8/8 queue=default
-small/default-small limit-at=10M/10M max-limit=10M/10M burst-limit=0/0
burst-threshold=0/0 burst-time=0s/0s bucket-size=0.1/0.1
```
If allow-dual-stack-queue is enabled, then a single dynamic simple queue entry will be created containing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /queue simple print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D name="dhcp-ds<6C:3B:6B:7C:41:3E>" target=192.168.1.200/32,fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66 parent=none packet-
marks="" priority=8/8 queue=default
-small/default-small limit-at=10M/10M max-limit=10M/10M
burst-limit=0/0 burst-threshold=0/0 burst-time=0s/0s bucket-size=0.1/0.1
```
RADIUS Support
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to use RADIUS to assign a rate-limit per DHCPv6 binding, to do so you need to pass the Mikrotik-Rate-Limit attribute
from your RADIUS Server for your DHCPv6 binding. To achieve this you first need to set your DHCPv6 Server to use RADIUS for assigning bindings.
Below is an example of how to set it up:
```
/radius
add address=10.0.0.1 secret=VERYsecret123 service=dhcp
/ipv6 dhcp-server
set dhcp1 use-radius=yes
```
After that, you need to tell your RADIUS Server to pass the Mikrotik-Rate-Limit attribute. In case you are using FreeRADIUS with MySQL, then you need to
add appropriate entries into radcheck and radreply tables for a MAC address, that is being used for your DHCPv6 Client. Below is an example for table
entries:
```
For any queues to work properly, the traffic must not be FastTracked, make sure your Firewall does not FastTrack traffic that you want to limit.
```
```
By default allow-dual-stack-queue is enabled, this will add a single dynamic simple queue entry for both DCHPv6 binding and DHCPv4
lease, without this option enabled separate dynamic simple queue entries will be added for IPv6 and IPv4.
```
```
INSERT INTO `radcheck` (`username`, `attribute`, `op`, `value`) VALUES
('000c4200d464', 'Auth-Type', ':=', 'Accept'),
INSERT INTO `radreply` (`username`, `attribute`, `op`, `value`) VALUES
('000c4200d464', 'Delegated-IPv6-Prefix', '=', 'fdb4:4de7:a3f8:418c::/66'),
('000c4200d464', 'Mikrotik-Rate-Limit', '=', '10M');
```
Configuration Example
Enabling IPv6 Prefix delegation
Let's consider that we already have a running DHCP server.
To enable IPv6 prefix delegation, first, we need to create an address pool:
```
/ipv6 pool add name=myPool prefix=2001:db8:7501::/60 prefix-length=62
```
Notice that prefix-length is 62 bits, which means that clients will receive /62 prefixes from the /60 pool.
The next step is to enable DHCP-PD:
```
/ipv6 dhcp-server add name=myServer prefix-pool=myPool interface=local
```
To test our server we will set up wide-dhcpv6 on an ubuntu machine:
```
install wide-dhcpv6-client
edit "/etc/wide-dhcpv6/dhcp6c.conf" as above
```
```
interface eth2{
send ia-pd 0;
};
```
```
id-assoc pd {
prefix-interface eth3{
sla-id 1;
sla-len 2;
};
};
```
```
Run DHCP-PD client:
```
```
sudo dhcp6c -d -D -f eth2
```
```
Verify that prefix was added to the:
```
```
By default allow-dual-stack-queue is enabled and will add a single dynamic queue entry if the MAC address from the IPv4 lease (or DUID, if the
DHCPv4 Client supports Node-specific Client Identifiers from RFC4361), but DUID from DHCPv6 Client is not always based on the
MAC address from the interface on which the DHCPv6 client is running on, DUID is generated on a per-device basis. For this reason, a single
dynamic queue entry might not be created, separate dynamic queue entries might be created instead.
```
```
You can use also RouterOS as a DHCP-PD client.
```
```
mrz@bumba:/media/aaa$ ip -6 addr
..
2: eth3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
inet6 2001:db8:7501:1:200:ff:fe00:0/64 scope global
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet6 fe80::224:1dff:fe17:81f7/64 scope link
valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
```
You can make binding to specific client static so that it always receives the same prefix:
```
```
[admin@RB493G] /ipv6 dhcp-server binding> print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS DU IAID SER.. STATUS 0 D 2001:db8:7501:1::/62 16 0 loc.. bound
[admin@RB493G] /ipv6 dhcp-server binding> make-static 0
```
```
DHCP-PD also installs a route to assigned prefix into IPv6 routing table:
```
```
[admin@RB493G] /ipv6 route> print
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic, C - connect, S - static, r - rip, o - ospf, b - bgp, U -
unreachable
# DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY DISTANCE
...
2 ADS 2001:db8:7501:1::/62 fe80::224:1dff:fe17:8... 1
```
Enabling IPv6 Address delegation
Address delegation on DHCPv6 server side works almost in the exact same way as when you configure prefix server. Only difference is that you must
specify in configuration address-pool instead of prefix-pool and the pool used for this server must be defined to use /128 prefix-length. Of course, you can
create server which only assigns static addresses and skip using the pool.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6/pool/print detail
Flags: D - dynamic
0 name="myAddressPool" prefix=2001:db8:7501::/120 prefix-length=128
[admin@MikroTik] > /ipv6/dhcp-server/print detail
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - invalid
0 name="myDHCP" interface=ether2 prefix-pool=static-only
address-pool=myAddressPool lease-time=3d rapid-commit=yes use-radius=no
preference=255 dhcp-option="" route-distance=1 use-reconfigure=no
address-lists="" duid="0x00030001b813f4840556"
```
This configuration is already enough to work with DHCPv6 clients such as, for example, RouterOS client.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6/dhcp-client/print detail
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - invalid
0 interface=ether2 status=bound duid="0x00030001b123f48407f0"
dhcp-server-v6=fe80::ba69:f4af:fe14:558 request=address
add-default-route=no use-peer-dns=yes allow-reconfigure=no
dhcp-options="" pool-name="" pool-prefix-length=64 prefix-hint=::/0
prefix-address-lists="" dhcp-options=""
address=2001:db8:7501::, 2d23h59m51s
```
However, usually end-devices as computers do not know if their network is managed by DHCP server or not. That is why DHCPv6 server configuration is
combined with SLAAC functionality. You can even avoid using SLAAC in order to advertise prefix for local network device, all you need to do is advertise
"managed-address-configuration" option to your network devices.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6/nd/print detail
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; * - default
0 interface=ether2 ra-interval=3m20s-10m ra-delay=3s mtu=unspecified
reachable-time=unspecified retransmit-interval=unspecified
ra-lifetime=30m ra-preference=medium hop-limit=unspecified
advertise-mac-address=yes advertise-dns=yes
managed-address-configuration=yes other-configuration=no
[admin@MikroTik] > ipv6/nd/prefix/print detail
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid; D - dynamic
0 prefix=::/64 6to4-interface=none interface=ether2 on-link=yes
autonomous=yes valid-lifetime=4w2d preferred-lifetime=1w
```
Now, for example, your computer which will be connected to router ether2 interface will receive advertisement message from RouterOS ND configuration
stating that this network is using "managed-address-configuration" which normally on end user devices will enable DHCPv6 client requesting IPv6 address.
Full configuration backup from the server with several comments is provided here.
```
#Address pool to be used for 'bridge', must have prefix-length 128
/ipv6 pool

```


# DHCP Relay

## Summary
Sub-menu: /ip dhcp-relay
The purpose of the DHCP relay is to act as a proxy between DHCP clients and the DHCP server. It is useful in networks where the DHCP server is not on
the same broadcast domain as the DHCP client.
DHCP relay does not choose the particular DHCP server in the DHCP-server list, it just sends the incoming request to all the listed servers.

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
add-relay-info (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
Adds DHCP relay agent information if enabled according to RFC 3046. Agent Circuit ID Sub-option contains mac address of
an interface, Agent Remote ID Sub-option contains MAC address of the client from which request was received.
```
```
delay-threshold (time |
none; Default: none)
```
```
If secs field in DHCP packet is smaller than delay-threshold, then this packet is ignored
```
```
dhcp-server (string;
Default: )
```
```
List of DHCP servers' IP addresses which should the DHCP requests be forwarded to
```
```
interface (string;
Default: )
```
```
Interface name the DHCP relay will be working on.
```
```
local-address (IP;
Default: 0.0.0.0)
```
```
The unique IP address of this DHCP relay needed for DHCP server to distinguish relays. If set to 0.0.0.0 - the IP address will
be chosen automatically
```
```
relay-info-remote-id (st
ring; Default: )
```
```
specified string will be used to construct Option 82 instead of client's MAC address. Option 82 consist of: interface from which
packets was received + client mac address or relay-info-remote-id
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name for the relay
```
```
local-address-as-src-ip
(yes | no; Default: no)
```
```
Use local address as source address for Discover/Request packets sent to the DHCP server
```
Configuration Example
Let us consider that you have several IP networks 'behind' other routers, but you want to keep all DHCP servers on a single router. To do this, you need a
DHCP relay on your network which will relay DHCP requests from clients to the DHCP server.
This example will show you how to configure a DHCP server and a DHCP relay that serves 2 IP networks - 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 that are
behind a router DHCP-Relay.
IP Address Configuration
IP addresses of DHCP-Server:
```
[admin@DHCP-Server] ip address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS NETWORK BROADCAST INTERFACE
0 192.168.0.1/24 192.168.0.0 192.168.0.255 To-DHCP-Relay
1 10.1.0.2/24 10.1.0.0 10.1.0.255 Public
[admin@DHCP-Server] ip address>
```
IP addresses of DHCP-Relay:
```
[admin@DHCP-Relay] ip address> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
# ADDRESS NETWORK BROADCAST INTERFACE
0 192.168.0.2/24 192.168.0.0 192.168.0.255 To-DHCP-Server
1 192.168.1.1/24 192.168.1.0 192.168.1.255 Local1
2 192.168.2.1/24 192.168.2.0 192.168.2.255 Local2
[admin@DHCP-Relay] ip address>
```
DHCP Server Setup
To setup 2 DHCP Servers on the DHCP-Server router add 2 pools. For networks 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0:
```
/ip pool add name=Local1-Pool ranges=192.168.1.11-192.168.1.100
/ip pool add name=Local2-Pool ranges=192.168.2.11-192.168.2.100
[admin@DHCP-Server] ip pool> print
# NAME RANGES

Create DHCP Servers:
```
/ip dhcp-server add interface=To-DHCP-Relay relay=192.168.1.1 \
address-pool=Local1-Pool name=DHCP-1 disabled=no
/ip dhcp-server add interface=To-DHCP-Relay relay=192.168.2.1 \

Configure respective networks:
```
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=192.168.1.1 \
dns-server=159.148.60.20
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.2.0/24 gateway=192.168.2.1 \

[admin@DHCP-Server] ip dhcp-server network>
```
DHCP Relay Config
Configuration of DHCP-Server is done. Now let's configure DHCP-Relay:
```
/ip dhcp-relay add name=Local1-Relay interface=Local1 \
dhcp-server=192.168.0.1 local-address=192.168.1.1 disabled=no
/ip dhcp-relay add name=Local2-Relay interface=Local2 \
dhcp-server=192.168.0.1 local-address=192.168.2.1 disabled=no
[admin@DHCP-Relay] ip dhcp-relay> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
# NAME INTERFACE DHCP-SERVER LOCAL-ADDRESS
0 Local1-Relay Local1 192.168.0.1 192.168.1.1
1 Local2-Relay Local2 192.168.0.1 192.168.2.1
[admin@DHCP-Relay] ip dhcp-relay>
```
DHCP Relay with VRF (introduced in 7.15)
Let's take the previous setup but we'll consider that the interface to the DHCP server and interfaces to DHCP clients are added in VRF:
```
/ip vrf
add interfaces=To-DHCP-Server name=vrf_server
add interfaces=Local2 name=vrf2
add interfaces=Local1 name=vrf1
```
In the DHCP-relay configuration dhcp-server-vrf should be added:
```
/ip dhcp-relay/set dhcp-server-vrf=vrf_server numbers=0,1
```
Due to VRF configuration there are several routing-tables - we should add additional routes:
```
/ip route
add disabled=no distance=1 dst-address=192.168.0.0/24 gateway=To-DHCP-Server@vrf_server pref-src="" routing-
table=vrf1 scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no \
target-scope=10
add disabled=no distance=1 dst-address=192.168.0.0/24 gateway=To-DHCP-Server@vrf_server pref-src="" routing-
table=vrf2 scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no \
target-scope=10
add disabled=no dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=Local1@vrf1 routing-table=vrf_server suppress-hw-offload=no
add disabled=no distance=1 dst-address=192.168.2.0/24 gateway=Local2@vrf2 pref-src="" routing-table=vrf_server
scope=30 suppress-hw-offload=no \
target-scope=10
```
To achieve successful DHCP-server - DHCP-relay communication we should add NAT rules:
/ip firewall nat
add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.2.1 dst-port=67 in-interface=To-DHCP-Server protocol=udp
src-address=192.168.0.1 to-addresses=\
192.168.0.2
add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.1.1 dst-port=67 in-interface=To-DHCP-Server protocol=udp
src-address=192.168.0.1 to-addresses=\
192.168.0.2

## Introduction
Domain Name System (DNS) usually refers to the Phonebook of the Internet. In other words, DNS is a database that links strings (known as hostnames),
such as [http://www.mikrotik.com](http://www.mikrotik.com) to a specific IP address, such as 159.148.147.196.
A MikroTik router with a DNS feature enabled can be set as a DNS cache for any DNS-compliant client. Moreover, the MikroTik router can be specified as
a primary DNS server under its DHCP server settings. When the remote requests are enabled, the MikroTik router responds to TCP and UDP DNS
requests on port 53.
When both static and dynamic servers are set, static server entries are preferred, however, it does not indicate that a static server will always be used (for
example, previously query was received from a dynamic server, but static was added later, then a dynamic entry will be preferred).
There are several options on how you can manage DNS functionality on your LAN - use public DNS, use the router as a cache, or do not interfere with
DNS configuration. Let us take as an example the following setup: Internet service provider (ISP) → Gateway (GW) → Local area network (LAN). The GW is
RouterOS based device with the default configuration:
```
You do not configure any DNS servers on the "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will forward the DNS server IP address
configuration received from `ISP` to `LAN` devices;
You configure DNS servers on the "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will give configured DNS servers to `LAN` devices (also "
/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes" must be enabled);
"dns-none" configured under DNS servers on "GW" DHCP server network configuration - the device will not forward any of the dynamic DNS
servers to `LAN` devices;
```

## DNS configuration
DNS facility is used to provide domain name resolution for the router itself as well as for the clients connected to it.
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-remote-requests (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Specifies whether to allow router usage as a DNS cache for remote clients. Otherwise, only the router itself will
use DNS configuration.
```

Default: 0s)
```
```
Extra time added to TTL when creating address list entry.
```
```
cache-max-ttl (time; Default: 1w) Maximum time-to-live for cache records. In other words, cache records will expire unconditionally after cache-max-
TTL time. Shorter TTLs received from DNS servers are respected.
```
```
cache-size (integer[64..
4294967295]; Default: 2048 )
```
```
Specifies the size of the DNS cache in KiB.
```
```
When DNS server allow-remote-requests are used make sure that you limit access to your server over TCP and UDP protocol port 53 only for
known hosts.
```
```
max-concurrent-queries (integer;
Default: 100 )
```
```
Specifies how many concurrent queries are allowed.

```
```
mdns-repeater-ifaces (list of
interfaces; Default: )
```
```
Once an interface in this list receives an mDNS packet, it will forward it to all other interfaces in this list. Only
supports IPv4.
```
```
query-server-timeout (time;
Default: 2s)
```
```
Specifies how long to wait for a query response from a server.
```
```
query-total-timeout (time; Default: 1
0s)
```
```
Specifies how long to wait for query response in total. Note that this setting must be configured taking into account
"query-server-timeout" and the number of used DNS servers.
```
```
servers (list of IPv4/IPv6 addresses
; Default: )
```
```
List of DNS server IPv4/IPv6 addresses
```
```
cache-used (integer) Shows the currently used cache size in KiB
```
```
dynamic-server (IPv4/IPv6 list) List of dynamically added DNS servers from different services, for example, DHCP.
```
```
doh-max-concurrent-queries (integ

```
```
doh-max-server-connections (integ
er; Default: 5 )
```
```
Specifies how many concurrent connections to the DoH server are allowed.
```
```
doh-timeout (time; Default: 5s) Specifies how long to wait for query response from the DoH server.
```
```
use-doh-server (string; Default: ) Specified which DoH server must be used for DNS queries. DoH functionality overrides "servers" usage if
specified. The server must be specified with an "https://" prefix.
```
```

max-concurrent-queries: 100
max-concurrent-tcp-sessions: 20
cache-size: 2048KiB
cache-max-ttl: 1d
cache-used: 48KiB
```
Dynamic DNS servers are obtained from different facilities available in RouterOS, for example, DHCP client, VPN client, IPv6 Router Advertisements, etc.
Servers are processed in a queue order - static servers as an ordered list, dynamic servers as an ordered list. When DNS cache has to send a request to
the server, it tries servers one by one until one of them responds. After that this server is used for all types of DNS requests. Same server is used for any
types of DNS requests, for example, A and AAAA types. If you use only dynamic servers, then the DNS returned results can change after reboot, because
servers can be loaded into IP/DNS settings in a different order due to a different speeds on how they are received from facilities mentioned above.
If at some point the server which was being used becomes unavailable and can not provide DNS answers, then the DNS cache restarts the DNS server
lookup process and goes through the list of specified servers once more.
DNS Cache
This menu provides two lists with DNS records stored on the server:
```
"/ip dns cache": this menu provides a list with cache DNS entries that RouterOS cache can reply with to client requests ;
"/ip dns cache all": This menu provides a complete list with all cached DNS records stored including also, for example, PTR records.
```
DNS Static
The MikroTik RouterOS DNS cache has an additional embedded DNS server feature that allows you to configure multiple types of DNS entries that can be
used by the DNS clients using the router as their DNS server. This feature can also be used to provide false DNS information to your network clients. For
example, resolving any DNS request for a certain set of domains (or for the whole Internet) to your own page.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip dns static add name=www.mikrotik.com address=10.0.0.1
```
The server is also capable of resolving DNS requests based on basic regular expressions so that multiple requests can be matched with the same entry. In
case an entry does not conform with DNS naming standards, it is considered a regular expression. The list is ordered and checked from top to bottom.
Regular expressions are checked first, then the plain records.
Use regex to match DNS requests:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip dns static add regexp="[*mikrotik*]" address=10.0.0.2
```
If DNS static entries list matches the requested domain name, then the router will assume that this router is responsible for any type of DNS request for the
particular name. For example, if there is only an "A" record in the list, but the router receives an "AAAA" request, then it will reply with an "A" record from
the static list and will query the upstream server for the "AAAA" record. If a record exists, then the reply will be forwarded, if not, then the router will reply
with an "ok" DNS reply without any records in it. If you want to override domain name records from the upstream server with unusable records, then you
can, for example, add a static entry for the particular domain name and specify a dummy IPv6 address for it "::ffff".
List all of the configured DNS entries as an ordered list:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip/dns/static/print
Columns: NAME, REGEXP, ADDRESS, TTL
# NAME REGEXP ADDRESS TTL
0 http://www.mikrotik.com 10.0.0.1 1d
1 [*mikrotik*] 10.0.0.2 1d
```
```
Property Description

```
```
mx-exchange (string) The domain name of the MX server.

```
```
type (A | AAAA | CNAME | FWD | MX | NS | N

```
DNS over HTTPS (DoH)
Starting from RouterOS version v6.47 it is possible to use DNS over HTTPS (DoH). DoH uses HTTPS protocol to send and receive DNS requests for
better data integrity. The main goal is to provide privacy by eliminating "man-in-the-middle" attacks (MITM).
Video: DoH setup
There are various ways to find out what root CA certificate is necessary. The easiest way is by using your WEB browser, navigating to the DoH site, and
checking the security of the website. You can download the certificate straight from the browser or fetch the certificate from a trusted source.
Download the certificate, upload it to your router and import it:
```
/certificate import file-name=CertificateFileName
```
Configure the DoH server:
```
/ip dns set use-doh-server=DoH_Server_Query_URL verify-doh-cert=yes
```
Note that you need at least one regular DNS server configured for the router to resolve the DoH hostname itself. If you do not have any dynamical or static
DNS server configured, add a static DNS entry for the DoH server domain name like this:
```
For each static A and AAAA record, in cache automatically is added a PTR record.
```
```
Regexp is case-sensitive, but DNS requests are not case sensitive, RouterOS converts DNS names to lowercase before matching any static
entries. You should write regex only with lowercase letters. Regular expression matching is significantly slower than plain text entries, so it is
advised to minimize the number of regular expression rules and optimize the expressions themselves.
```
```
Be careful when you configure regex through mixed user interfaces - CLI and GUI. Adding the entry itself might require escape characters when
added from CLI. It is recommended to add an entry and the execute print command in order to verify that regex was not changed during
addition.
```
```
It is strongly recommended to import the root CA certificate of the DoH server you have chosen to use for increased security. We strongly
suggest not using third-party download links for certificate fetching. Use the Certificate Authority's own website.
```
```
/ip dns set servers=1.1.1.1
```
If you do not have any dynamical or static DNS server configured, add a static DNS entry for the DoH server domain name like this:
```
/ip dns static add address=IP_Address name=Domain_Name
```
Known compatible/incompatible DoH services
Compatible DoH services:
```
Cloudflare
Google
NextDNS
OpenDNS
```
Incompatible DoH services:
```
Mullvad
Yandex
UncensoredDNS
```
Adlist
Adlist is an integral component of network-level ad blocking, comprising a curated collection of domain names known for serving advertisements. This
feature operates by utilizing Domain Name System (DNS) resolution to intercept A and AAAA requests to these domains. When a client device queries a
DNS server for a domain listed on the adlist, the DNS resolution process is altered. Instead of returning the actual IP address of the ad-serving domain, the
DNS server responds with the IP address 0.0.0.0. This effectively null-routes the request, as 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to denote an
invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target. By redirecting ad-related requests in this manner, the adlist feature ensures that advertisement content is not
loaded, enhancing network performance and improving the user experience by reducing unwanted ad traffic.
Video: Adlist setup
```
Property Description
```
```
url Used to specify the URL of an adlist.
```
```
ssl-verify Specifies whether to validate the server's SSL certificate when connecting to an online resource. Will use the "/certificate" list to verify
server validity.
```
```
If DoH server is being used (DoH DNS name can be resolved) then it will be the only DNS service working at the time and standard DNS
servers from IP/DNS servers list will not be used.
```
```
If /certificate/settings/set crl-use is set to yes, RouterOS will check CRL for each certificate in a certificate chain, therefore, an entire certificate
chain should be installed into a device - starting from Root CA, intermediate CA (if there are such), and certificate that is used for specific
service.
```
```
For example, Google DoH, Cloudflare, and OpenDNS full chain contain three certificates,  NextDNS has four certificates.
```
```
Before configuring, increase the DNS cache as it's used to store adlist entries. If limit is reached and error in DNS,error topic is printed "adlist
read: max cache size reached"
```
```
Adlist is stored on device's internal memory. Ensure that there is enough free space to save the desired adlist.
```
```
file Used to specify a local file path from which to read adlist data
```
```
pause Temporarily pause the use of all adlist.
```
```
reload Checks for updates for all lists, if updates are found, the list is updated, removing or adding entries as needed, the lists are not
redownloaded in whole when issuing a reload, instead only necessary updates are done.
```
Whitelist for Adlist
To exempt certain domains from Adlist, you need to create a static DNS FWD entry, for example, /ip/dns/static/add name=bar.test type=FWD,
if such entry is present, the query will be forwarded to the next DNS, either dynamic or one configured under "/ip/dns/set servers=" , FWD entries
are supported by DoH as well.
Whitelist support was added in 7.17beta1.
Configuration examples:
URL based adlist:
```
/ip/dns/adlist add url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts ssl-verify=no
```
To see how many domain names are present and matched, you can run:
```
/ip/dns/adlist/print
Flags: X - disabled
0 url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts" ssl-verify=no match-count=122 name-
count=164769
```
Locally hosted adlist:
To create your adlist, you can create a Txt file with the domains. Example:
```
0.0.0.0 example1.com
0.0.0.0 eu1.example.com
0.0.0.0 ex.com
0.0.0.0 com.example.com
```
To add file to adlist :
```
/ip/dns/adlist/add file=host.txt
```
```
It's not mandatory to use reload to update the lists, Adlist checks for new updates once every hour.
```
```
You can create the txt file on your PC, but it is also possible to create it in RouterOS, with following commands
```
```
"/file/add name=host.txt", and then you can run "file/edit host.txt contents" after adding entries, press "ctrl o" to save the entries.
```
```
You can verify that file is formatted correctly with "/ip/dns/adlist/print" ,the results will show how many hostnames you have added, the hostname
format must match the format given in previous example.
```
```
/ip/dns/adlist/print
Flags: X - disabled
0 file=host.txt match-count=0 name-count=4
```
Forwarders (available from RouterOS 7.17)
DNS Forwarders allows a user to configure a named DNS forwarder that can be used for static FWD entries as forward-to value.
For each Forwarder is possible to configure multiple regular upstream and DoH servers. Configured forwarder servers will be used by round-robin
algorithm - for each new query, next configured server will be used to resolve DNS name.
Forwarder configuration
In /ip/dns/forwaders section, forwarders can added, modified or removed.
```
Property Description
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Forwarder name.
```
```
dns-servers (string; Default: ) An IP address or DNS name of a domain name server. Can contain multiple records, for example, dns-servers=1.
1.1.1,8.8.8.8,local.dns
```
```
doh-servers (string; Default: ) A URL of DoH server. Can contain multiple records.
```
```
verify-doh-cert (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Specifies whether to validate the DoH server, when one is being used. Will use the "/certificate" list in order to verify
server validity.
```
Configuration example
Configure/add a forwarder:
```
/ip dns forwarders
add dns-servers=1.1.1.1,local.dns doh-servers=https://dns.google/dns-query name=forwarder1
```
Configure/add a statis DNS FWD entry:
```
/ip dns static
add forward-to=forwarder1 name=mikrotik.com type=FWD
```
Now each time when a router will receive request to resolve mikrotik.com, request using round-robin algorithm will be forwarded to 1.1.1.1, local.dns or Goo
gle DoH server.

Application Examples
```

## Introduction
SOCKS (Socket Secure) is a proxy server that allows TCP-based application data to relay across the firewall, even if the firewall would block the packets.
The SOCKS protocol is independent of application protocols, so it can be used for many services, e.g, WWW, FTP, TELNET, and others.
At first, an application client connects to the SOCKS proxy server, then the proxy server looks in its access list to see whether the client is permitted to
access the remote application resource or not, if it is permitted, the proxy server relies on the packet to the application server and creates a connection
between the application server and client.
Remember to configure your application client to use SOCKS!.
You should secure the SOCKS proxy using its access list and/or firewall to disallow access from outside. Failing to secure the proxy server may introduce
security issues to your network, and may provide a way for spammers to send junk mail through the router.

## Summary
MikroTik RouterOS performs proxying of HTTP and HTTP-proxy (for FTP and HTTP protocols) requests. The proxy server performs the Internet object
cache function by storing requested Internet objects, i.e., data available via HTTP and FTP protocols on a system positioned closer to the recipient in the
form of speeding up customer browsing by delivering them requested file copies from the proxy cache at local network speed. MikroTik RouterOS
implements the following proxy server features:
```
Regular HTTP proxy – customer (itself) specifies what is a proxy server for him;
Transparent proxy – the customer does not know about the proxy being enabled and there isn’t a necessity for any additional configuration for the
web browser of the client;
Access list by source, destination, URL, and requested method (HTTP firewall);
Cache access list to specify which objects to cache, and which not;
Direct Access List – to specify which resources should be accessed directly, and which - through another proxy server;
Logging facility – allows to get and store information about the proxy operation;
Parent proxy support – allows to specify another proxy server, (if they don’t have the requested object ask their parents, or to the original server);
```
A proxy server usually is placed at various points between users and the destination server (also known as the origin server) on the Internet.
A Web proxy (cache) watches requests coming from clients, saving copies of the responses for itself. Then, if there is another request for the same URL, it
can use the response that it has, instead of asking the origin server for it again. If the proxy has not requested a file, it downloads that from the original
server.
There can be many potential purposes of proxy servers:
```
To increase access speed to resources (it takes less time for the client to get the object);
Works as HTTP firewall (deny access to undesirable web pages);
```
Allows filtering web content (by specific parameters, like source address, a destination address, port, URL, HTTP request method) scan outbound content,
e.g., for data leak protection.
Configuration examples
```
/ip/proxy
```
In MikroTik RouterOS, a proxy configuration is performed in the /ip/proxy menu. See below how to enable the proxy on port 8080 and set up
192.168.88.254 as the proxy source address:
```
It may be useful to have a Web proxy running even with no cache when you want to use it only as something like an HTTP and FTP firewall (for
example, denying access to undesired web pages or denying a specific type of files e.g. .mp3 files) or to redirect requests to external proxy
(possibly, to a proxy with caching functions) transparently.
```
```

```
Transparent proxy configuration example
RouterOS can also act as a Transparent Caching server, with no configuration required in the customer’s web browser. A transparent proxy does not
modify the requested URL or response. RouterOS will take all HTTP requests and redirect them to the local proxy service. This process will be entirely
transparent to the user (users may not know anything about a proxy server that is located between them and the original server), and the only difference to
them will be the increased browsing speed.
To enable the transparent mode, the firewall rule in destination NAT has to be added, specifying which connections (to which ports) should be
transparently redirected to the proxy. Check proxy settings above and redirect us users (192.168.1.0/24) to a proxy server:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat> add chain=dstnat protocol=tcp src-address=192.168.1.0/24 dst-port=80
action=redirect to-ports=8080
[admin@MikroTik] ip firewall nat> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 chain=dstnat protocol=tcp dst-port=80 action=redirect to-ports=8080
```
The web proxy can be used as a transparent and normal web proxy at the same time. In transparent mode, it is possible to use it as a standard web
proxy, too. However, in this case, proxy users may have trouble reaching web pages that are accessed transparently.
Proxy-based firewall – Access List
An access list is implemented in the same way as MikroTik firewall rules processed from the top to the bottom. The first matching rule specifies the
decision of what to do with this connection. Connections can be matched by their source address, destination address, destination port, sub-string of the
requested URL (Uniform Resource Locator), or request method. If none of these parameters is specified, every connection will match this rule.
If a connection is matched by a rule, the action property of this rule specifies whether a connection will be allowed or not (deny). If a connection does not
match any rule, it will be allowed.
In this example assume that we have configured a transparent proxy server, it will block the website [http://www.facebook.com,](http://www.facebook.com,) we can always block the
same for different networks by giving src-address:
```
/ip proxy access add src-address=192.168.1.0/24 dst-host=www.facebook.com action=deny
```
Users from network 192.168.1.0/24 will not be able to access the website [http://www.facebook.com.](http://www.facebook.com.)
You can block also websites that contain specific words in the URL:
```
When setting up a regular proxy service, make sure it serves only your clients and prevents unauthorized access to it by creating a firewall that
allows only your clients to use a proxy, otherwise, it may be used as an open proxy.
```
```
/ip proxy access add dst-host=:mail action=deny
```
This statement will block all websites which contain the word “mail” in the URL. Like [http://www.mail.com,](http://www.mail.com,) [http://www.hotmail.com,](http://www.hotmail.com,) mail.yahoo.com, etc.
We can also stop downloading specific types of files like .flv, .avi, .mp4, .mp3, .exe, .dat, ...etc.
```
/ip proxy access
add path=*.flv action=deny
add path=*.avi action=deny
add path=*.mp4 action=deny
add path=*.mp3 action=deny
add path=*.zip action=deny
add path=*.rar action=deny
```
Here are available also different wildcard characters, to create specific conditions and to match them by proxy access list. Wildcard properties (dst-host
and dst-path) match a complete string (i.e., they will not match "example.com" if they are set to "example"). Available wildcards are '*' (match any number
of any characters) and '?' (match any one character).
Regular expressions are also accepted here, but if the property should be treated as a regular expression, it should start with a colon (':').
To show that no symbols are allowed before the given pattern, we use the ^ symbol at the beginning of the pattern.
To specify that no symbols are allowed after the given pattern, we use the $ symbol at the end of the pattern.
Enabling RAM or Store-based caching.
In this example, it will presume that you already have the proxy configured and working and you just want to enable caching. If a command/parameter
detailed description is required check the reference section which is located right below the example section.
```
RAM-based caching:
Good if you have a device with a considerable amount of RAM for caching. Enabling this on a device with RAM 256MB or less will not
give your network any benefit.
Way faster cache writes/read than one that is stored on USB or SATA connected mediums.
```
```
Store-based caching:
Larger proxy caches are available simply due to medium capacity differences.
```

```
Maximal time to store a cached object. The validity period of an object is usually defined by the object itself, but in case it
is set too high, you can override the maximal value
```
```
max-server-
connections (integer:
Dynamic ; Default:  600 )
```
```
Maximal number of connections made to servers (any further connections from clients will be put on hold until some
server connections will terminate)
```
```
parent-proxy (Ip4 | ip6;
Default: 0.0.0.0)
```
```
IP address and port of another HTTP proxy to redirect all requests to. If set to 0.0.0.0 parent proxy is not used.
```
```
parent-proxy-port (integ
er: 0..65535; Default:  0 )
```
```
Port that parent proxy is listening on.
```
```
port (integer: 0..65535;
Default:  8080 )
```
```
TCP port the proxy server will be listening on. This port has to be specified on all clients that want to use the server as an
HTTP proxy. A transparent (with zero configuration for clients) proxy setup can be made by redirecting HTTP requests to
this port in the IP firewall using the destination NAT feature
```
```
serialize-connections (y
es | no; Default: no)
```
```
Do not make multiple connections to the server for multiple client connections, if possible (i.e. server supports persistent
HTTP connections). Clients will be served on the FIFO principle; the next client is processed when the response transfer
to the previous one is completed. If a client is idle for too long (max 5 seconds by default), it will give up waiting and open
another connection to the server
```
```
src-address (Ip4 | Ip6;
Default: 0.0.0.0)
```
```
A proxy will use a specified address when connecting to the parent proxy or website. If set to 0.0.0.0 then the appropriate
IP address will be taken from the routing table.
```
Access List
```
/ip/proxy/access
```
An access list is configured like regular firewall rules. Rules are processed from the top to the bottom. The first matching rule specifies the decision of what
to do with this connection. There is a total of 6 classifiers that specify matching constraints. If none of these classifiers is specified, the particular rule will
match every connection.
If a connection is matched by a rule, the action property of this rule specifies whether a connection will be allowed or not. If the particular connection does
not match any rule, it will be allowed.
```
Property Description
```
```
action (allow | deny; Default: allow) Specifies whether to pass or deny matched packets
```
```
dst-address (Ip4[-Ip4 | /0..32] | Ip6/0..128;
Default: )
```
```
The destination address of the target server.
```
```
dst-host (string; Default: ) IP address or DNS name used to make a connection to the target server (this is the string user
wrote in a browser before specifying the port and path to a particular web page
```
```
dst-port (integer[-integer[,integer[,...]]]: 0..
65535 ; Default: )
```
```
List or range of ports the packet is destined to
```
```
local-port (integer: 0..65535; Default: ) Specifies the port of the web proxy via which the packet was received. This value should match one
of the ports the web proxy is listening on.
```
```
method (any | connect | delete | get | head |
options | post | put | trace; Default: )
```
```
The HTTP method used in the request (see HTTP Methods section at the end of this document)
```
```
path (string; Default: ) Name of the requested page within the target server (i.e. the name of a particular web page or
document without the name of the server it resides on)
```
```
redirect-to (string; Default: ) In case of access is denied by this rule, the user shall be redirected to the URL specified here
```
```
src-address (Ip4[-Ip4 | /0..32] | Ip6/0..128;
Default: )
```
```
The source address of the connection originator.
```
Read-only properties:
```
Property Description
```
```
hits (integer) Count of requests that were matched by this rule
```
Wildcard properties (dst-host and dst-path) match a complete string (i.e., they will not match "example.com" if they are set to "example"). Available
wildcards are '*' (match any number of any characters) and '?' (match any one character). Regular expressions are also accepted here, but if the property
should be treated as a regular expression, it should start with a colon (':').
Small hints in using regular expressions:
```
\\ symbol sequence is used to enter \ character in the console;
\. pattern means. only (in regular expressions single dot in a pattern means any symbol);
to show that no symbols are allowed before the given pattern, we use the ^ symbol at the beginning of the pattern;
to specify that no symbols are allowed after the given pattern, we use the $ symbol at the end of the pattern;
to enter [ or ] symbols, you should escape them with backslash "\.";
```
It is strongly recommended to deny all IP addresses except those behind the router as the proxy still may be used to access your internal-use-only
(intranet) web servers. Also, consult examples in Firewall Manual on how to protect your router.
Direct Access
```
/ip/proxy/direct
```
If a parent-proxy property is specified, it is possible to tell the proxy server whether to try to pass the request to the parent proxy or to resolve it by
connecting to the requested server directly. The direct Access List is managed just like the Proxy Access List described in the previous chapter except for
the action argument. Unlike the access list, the direct proxy access list has a default action equal to deny. It takes place when no rules are specified or a
particular request did not match any rule.
```
Property Description
```
```
action (allow | deny; Default: allow) Specifies the action to perform on matched packets:
```
```
allow - always resolve matched requests directly bypassing the parent router
deny - resolve matched requests through the parent proxy. If no one is specified this has the
same effect as allow.
```
```
dst-address (Ip4[-Ip4 | /0..32] | Ip6/0..128;
Default: )
```
```
The destination address of the target server.
```
```

65535 ; Default: )
```
```
List or range of ports used by connection to the target server.
```
```
local-port (integer: 0..65535; Default: ) Specifies the port of the web proxy via which the packet was received. This value should match
one of the ports the web proxy is listening on.
```
```
method (any | connect | delete | get | head |
options | post | put | trace; Default: )
```
```
The HTTP method used in the request (see HTTP Methods section at the end of this document)
```
```

Cache Management
```
/ip/proxy/cache
```

implemented exactly the same way as the web proxy access list. The default action is to cache an object (if no matching rule is found).
```

```
```

```
```
List or range of ports the packet is destined to.

HTTP Methods
Options
This method is a request for information about the communication options available on the chain between the client and the server identified by the Request
-URI. The method allows the client to determine the options and (or) the requirements associated with a resource without initiating any resource retrieval
GET
This method retrieves whatever information identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data processing process then the response to the
GET method should contain data produced by the process, not the source code of the process procedure(-s), unless the source is the result of the process.
The GET method can become a conditional GET if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-
Range header field. The conditional GET method is used to reduce the network traffic specifying that the transfer of the entity should occur only under
circumstances described by conditional header field(-s).
The GET method can become a partial GET if the request message includes a Range header field. The partial GET method intends to reduce
unnecessary network usage by requesting only parts of entities without transferring data already held by the client.
The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets the requirements for HTTP caching.
HEAD
This method shares all features of GET method except that the server must not return a message-body in the response. This retrieves the metainformation
of the entity implied by the request which leads to its wide usage of it for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
The response to a HEAD request may be cacheable in the way that the information contained in the response may be used to update the previously
cached entity identified by that Request-URI.
POST
This method requests that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI.
The actual action performed by the POST method is determined by the origin server and usually is Request-URI dependent.
Responses to POST method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.
PUT
This method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If another entity exists under specified Request-URI, the
enclosed entity should be considered as an updated (newer) version of that residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI is not pointing to an existing
resource, the origin server should create a resource with that URI.
If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries should be treated as stale.
Responses to this method are not cacheable.
TRACE
This method invokes a remote, application-layer loop-back of the request message. The final recipient of the request should reflect the message received
back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. The final recipient is either the origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-
Forwards value of 0 in the request. A TRACE request must not include an entity.
Responses to this method MUST NOT be cached.

RIP Configuration
```

## Routing Tables
By default, all routes are added to the "main" routing table as it was before. From a configuration point of view, the biggest differences are routing table
limit increase, routing table monitoring differences, and how routes are added to specific routing tables (see next example)
v7 introduces a new menu /routing route, which shows all address family routes as well as all filtered routes with all possible route attributes. /ip route a
nd /ipv6 route menus are used to add static routes and for simplicity show only basic route attributes.
For more in-depth information on routing see this article (IP Routing).
Another new change is that most common route print requests are processed by the routing process which significantly improves the speed compared to
v6.

## Use of Routing Tables and Policy Routing
The main difference from v6 is that the routing table must be added to the /routing table menu before actually referencing it anywhere in the
configuration.  And fib parameter should be specified if the routing table is intended to push routes to the  FIB.
The routing rule configuration is the same except for the menu location (instead of /ip route rule, now it is /routing rule).
Let's consider a basic example where we want to resolve 8.8.8.8 only in the routing table named myTable to the gateway 172.16.1.1:
```
/routing table add name=myTable fib
/routing rule add dst-address=8.8.8.8 action=lookup-only-in-table table=myTable
/ip route add dst-address=8.8.8.8 gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=myTable
```
Instead of routing rules, you could use mangle to mark packets with routing-mark, the same way as it was in ROSv6.

## OSPF Configuration
OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 are now merged into one single menu /routing ospf. At the time of writing this article, there are no default instances and areas.
To start both OSPFv2 and OSPF v3 instances, first, you need to create an instance for each and then add an area to the instance.
```
/routing ospf instance
add name=v2inst version=2 router-id=1.2.3.4
add name=v3inst version=3 router-id=1.2.3.4
/routing ospf area
add name=backbone_v2 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v2inst
add name=backbone_v3 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v3inst
```
At this point, you are ready to start OSPF on the network interface. In the case of IPv6, you add either interface on which you want to run OSPF (the same
as ROSv6) or the IPv6 network. In the second case, OSPF will automatically detect the interface. Here are some interface configuration examples:
```
/routing ospf interface-template
add network=192.168.0.0/24 area=backbone_v2
add network=2001:db8::/64 area=backbone_v3
add network=ether1 area=backbone_v3
```
ROSv7 uses templates to match the interface against the template and apply configuration from the matched template.  OSPF menus interface and ne
ighbor contains read-only entries purely for status monitoring.
All route distribution control is now done purely with routing filter select, no more redistribution knobs in the instance (Since the v7.1beta7 redistribution
knob is back, you still need to use routing filters to set route costs and type if necessary). This gives greater flexibility on what routes from which protocols
you want to redistribute.
For example, let's say you want to redistribute only static IPv4 routes from the 192.168.0.0/16 network range.
```
/routing ospf instance
set backbone_v2 out-filter-chain=ospf_out redistribute=static
```
```
/routing filter rule add chain=ospf_out rule="if (dst in 192.168.0.0/16) {accept}"
```
BGP Configuration
There is a complete redesign of the BGP configuration compared to ROSv6. The first biggest difference is that there is no more instance and peer conf
iguration menus. Instead, we have connection, template and session menus.
The reason for such a structure is to strictly split parameters that are responsible for connection and parameters that are BGP protocol specific.
Let's start with the Template. It contains all BGP protocol-related configuration options. It can be used as a template for dynamic peers and apply a similar
config to a group of peers. Note that this is not the same as peer groups on Cisco devices, where the group is more than just a common configuration.
By default, there is a default template that requires you to set your own AS.
```
/routing/bgp/template set default as=65533
```
Most of the parameters are similar to ROSv6 except that some are grouped in the output and input section making the config more readable and easier to
understand whether the option is applied on input or output. If you are familiar with CapsMan then the syntax is the same, for example, to specify the
output selection chain you set output.filter-chain=myBgpChain.
You can even inherit template parameters from another template, for example:
```
/routing/bgp/template
add name=myAsTemplate as=65500 output.filter-chain=myAsFilter
set default template=myAsTemplate
```
Another important aspect of the new routing configuration is the global Router ID, which sets router-id and group peers in one instance. RouterOS adds a
default ID which picks instance-id from any interface's highest IP. The default BGP template by default is set to use the "default" ID.
If for any reason you need to tweak or add new instances it can be done in /routing id menu.
Very interesting parameters are input.affinity and output.affinity, they allow control in which process input and output of active session will be
processed:
```
The default action of the routing filter chain is "drop"
```
```
Starting from v7.1beta4 template parameters are exposed in the "connection" configuration. This means that the template is not mandatory
anymore, allowing for an easier basic BGP connection setup, similar to what it was in ROSv6.
```
```
alone - input and output of each session are processed in its own process, most likely the best option when there are a lot of cores and a lot of
peers
afi, instance, vrf, remote-as - try to run input/output of new session in process with similar parameters
main - run input/output in the main process (could potentially increase performance on single-core even possibly on multicore devices with small
amount of cores)
input - run output in the same process as input (can be set only for output affinity)
```
Now that we have parameters set for the template we can add BGP connections. A minimal set of parameters are remote.address, template, conne
ct, listen and local.role
Connect and listen to parameters specify whether peers will try to connect and listen to a remote address or just connect or just listen. It is possible that in
setups where peer uses the multi-hop connection local.address must be configured too (similar as it was with update-source in ROSv6).
Peer role is now a mandatory parameter, for basic setups, you can just use ibgp, ebgp (more information on available roles can be found in the
corresponding RFC draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy/?include_text=1), keep in mind that at the moment capabilities,
communities, and filtering described in the draft is not implemented.
Very basic iBGP set up to listen on the whole local network for connections:
```
/routing/bgp/connection
add remote.address=10.155.101.0/24 listen=yes template=default local.role=ibgp
```
Now you can monitor the status of all connected and disconnected peers from /routing bgp session menu.
Other great debugging information on all routing processes can be monitored from /routing stats menu
```

```
Route filtering differs a bit from ROSv6. In the BGP template, you can now specify output.filter-chain, output.filter-select, input.filter as well as several input.
accept-* options.
Now input.accept-* allows filtering incoming messages directly before they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory
usage. Regular input filter chain can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing route table as "not active,
filtered",
A very basic example of a BGP input filter to accept prefixes from 192.168.0.0/16 subnet without modifying any attributes. For other prefixes subtract 1
from the received local pref value and set IGP metric to value from OSPF ext. Additionally, we will accept only specific  prefixes from the address list to
reduce memory usage
```
/ip/firewall/address-list
add list=bgp_list dst-address=192.168.1.0/24
add list=bgp_list dst-address=192.168.0.0/24
add list=bgp_list dst-address=172.16.0.0/24
```
```
It is not mandatory to specify a remote AS number. ROS v7 can determine remote ASN from an open message. You should specify the remote
AS only when you want to accept a connection from that specific AS.
```
```
/routing/bgp/template
set default input.filter=bgp_in .accept-nlri=bgp_list
```
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="if (dst in 192.168.0.0/16) {accept}"
add chain=bgp_in rule="set bgp-local-pref -1; set bgp-igp-metric ospf-ext-metric; accept"
```
Monitoring Advertisements
RouterOS v7 by default disables monitoring of the BGP output. This allows to significantly reduce resource usage on setups with large routing tables.
To be able to see output advertisements several steps should be taken:
```
enable "output.keep-sent-attributes" in BGP connection configuration
run "dump-saved-advertisements" from BGP session menu
view saved output from "/routing/stats/pcap" menu
```
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /routing/bgp/connection> set 0 output.keep-sent-attributes=yes
[admin@arm-bgp] /routing/bgp/session> print
Flags: E - established
0 E remote.address=10.155.101.183 .as=444 .id=192.168.44.2 .refused-cap-opt=no .capabilities=mp,rr,gr,as4

output.procid=66 .filter-chain=bgp_out .network=bgp-nets .keep-sent-attributes=yes
input.procid=66 ebgp
hold-time=3m keepalive-time=1m uptime=4s30ms
```
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /routing/bgp/session> dump-saved-advertisements 0 save-to=test_out.pcap
```
Networks
Lastly, you might notice that the network menu is missing and probably wondering how to advertise your own networks. Now networks are added to the
firewall address-list and referenced in the BGP configuration.
Following ROSv6 network configuration:
```
/routing bgp network add network=192.168.0.0/24 synchronize=yes
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.0.0/24 type=blackhole
```
would translate to v7 as:
```
/ip/firewall/address-list/
add list=bgp-networks address=192.168.0.0/24
```
```
/ip/route
add dst-address=192.168.0.0/24 blackhole
```
```
/routing/bgp/connection
set peer_name output.network=bgp-networks
```
```
If the routing filter chain is not specified BGP will try to advertise every active route it can find in the routing table
```
```
The default action of the routing filter chain is "drop"
```
There is more configuration to be done when adding just one network but offers simplicity when you have to deal with a large number of networks. v7 even
allows specifying for each BGP connection its own set of networks.
Routing Filters
Starting from ROSv7.1beta4, the routing filter configuration is changed to a script-like configuration. The rule now can have "if .. then" syntax to set
parameters or apply actions based on conditions from the "if" statement.
Multiple rules without action are stacked in a single rule and executed in order like a firewall, the reason is that the "set" parameter order is important and
writing one "set"s per line, allows for an easier understanding from top to bottom on what actions were applied.
For example, match static default route and apply action accept can be written in one config rule:
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=ospf_in rule="if (dst==0.0.0.0/0 && protocol static) { accept }"
```
For example, ROSv6 rule "/routing filter add chain=ospf_in prefix=172.16.0.0/16 prefix-length=24 protocol=static action=accept" converted to ROSv7 would
be:
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=ospf_in rule="if (dst in 172.16.0.0/16 && dst-len==24 && protocol static) { accept }"
```
Another example, to match prefixes from the 172.16.0.0/16 range with prefix length equal to 24 and set BGP med and prepend values
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=BGP_OUT rule="if (dst-len==24 && dst in 172.16.0.0/16) { \n
set bgp-med 20; set bgp-path-prepend 2; accept }"
```
It is also possible to match prefix length range like this
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=BGP_OUT rule="if (dst-len>13 && dst-len<31 && dst in 172.16.0.0/16) { accept }"
```
Filter rules now can be used to match or set communities,  large communities, and extended communities from the community list:
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="set bgp-large-communities 200001:200001:10 "
```
If there are a lot of community sets, that need to be applied in multiple rules, then it is possible to define community sets and use them to match or set:
```
/routing/filter/large-community-set
add set=myLargeComSet communities=200001:200001:10
```
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="append bgp-large-communities myLargeComSet "
```
Since route-target is encoded in extended community attribute to change or match RT you need to operate on extended community attribute, for example:
```
In v7 it is not possible to turn off synchronization with IGP routes (the network will be advertised only if the corresponding IGP route is present in
the routing table).
```
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="set bgp-ext-communities rt:327824:20 "
```
RPKI
RouterOS implements an RTR client. You connect to the server which will send route validity information. This information then can be used to validate
routes in route filters against a group with "rpki-validate" and further in filters "match-rpki" can be used to match the exact state.
For more info refer to the RPKI documentation.
RIP Configuration
To start RIP, the instance should be configured. There you should select which routes will be redistributed by RIP and if it will redistribute the default route.
```
/routing/rip/instance
add name=instance1 originate-default=never redistribute=connected,static
```
Then interface-template should be configured. There is no need to define networks in ROS version 7 as it was in version 6.
```
/routing/rip/interface-template
add interfaces=ether1 instance=instance1
```
Now the basic configuration is completed on one router. RIP neighbor router should be configured in a similar way.
In ROS v7 the neighbors will appear only when there are routes to be sent or/and to be received.
Prefix lists from ROSv6 are deprecated, now all the filtering must be done by the routing filters.


# Routing Protocol Multi-core Support

## Overview
RouterOS v7 is capable of splitting tasks between multiple processes.
There is one "main" task, which can start/stop sub-tasks and process data between those sub-tasks. Each sub-task can allocate "private" (only accessible
by this particular task) and "shared" memory (accessible by all route tasks).
List of tasks that run in separate processes (if multiprocess routing is enabled):
```
Handling of "print" command;
Entire OSPF protocol handling;
Entire RIP protocol handling;
Entire ISIS protocol handling;
Static configuration handling;
Routing Policy configuration;
BGP connections and configuration handling;
BGP receive (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters);
BGP send (one task per peer or grouped by specific parameters);
FIB update.
```

## BGP Sub-Tasks
BGP receive and send can be split into sub-tasks by specific parameters, for example, it is possible to run input per each peer or group all peer inputs and
run them in the main process. This split by sub-tasks is controlled with input.affinity and output.affinity parameter configuration in /routing
/bgp/template.It is possible to boost performance by playing with affinity values on devices with fewer cores since sharing data between tasks is a bit
slower than processing the same data within one task. For example, on single-core or two-core devices running input and output in the main or instance
process will boost performance.
All currently used tasks and their allocated private/shared memory can be monitored using the command:
```
/routing/stats/process/print
```
Sample Output:
```
BGP can have up to 100 unique processes.
```

Routing Table Update Mechanism
Illustration below tries to explain in more user friendly form on how routing table update mechanism is working.
Routing protocols continuously loop through following procedures:
```
"main" process waits for updates from other sub tasks (1);
"main" starts to calculate new routes (2..4) if:
update from sub task is received;
protocol has not published all routes;
configuration has changed or link state has changed.
during new route calculation (5) following event occur:
all received updates are applied to the route;
gateway reachability is being determined;
recursive route is being resolved;
"publish" event is called where "current" routes are being published. During this phase, "current" routes will not change, but protocols can still
receive and send updates (6).
Do cleanup and free unused memory (7). In this step everything that is no longer used in new "current" table is removed (routes, attributes, etc.).
```
Consider "updated" and "current" as two copies of routing table, where "current" table (2) is the one used at the moment and "updated" (1) is table of
candidate routes to be published in the next publish event (3 and 4). This method prevents protocols to fill memory with buffered updates while "main"
process is doing "publish", instead protocols sends the newest update directly to "main" process which then copies new update in "updated" table. A bit
more complicated is OSPF, it internally has similar process to select current OSPF routes which then are sent to the  "main" for further processing.


# Policy Routing

## Overview
Policy routing is the method to steer traffic matching certain criteria to a certain gateway. This can be used to force some customers or specific protocols
from the servers (for example HTTP traffic) to always be routed to a certain gateway. It can even be used to steer local and overseas traffic to different
gateways.
RouterOS implements several components that can be used to achieve said task:
```
routing tables
routing rules
firewall mangle marking
```

## Routing Tables
A router can have multiple routing tables with its own set of routes routing the same destination to different gateways.
Tables can be seen and configured from the /routing/table menu.
By default, RouterOS has only the 'main' routing table:
```
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /routing/table> print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - invalid; U - used
0 D name="main" fib
```
If a custom routing table is required, it should be defined in this menu prior to using it anywhere in the configuration.
Let's consider a basic example where we have two gateways 172.16.1.1 and 172.16.2.1 and we want to resolve 8.8.8.8 only in the routing table named 'my
Table' to the gateway 172.16.2.1:
```
/routing table add name=myTable fib
/ip route add dst-address=8.8.8.8 gateway=172.16.1.1
/ip route add dst-address=8.8.8.8 gateway=172.16.2.1@main routing-table=myTable
```
In our example, the main routing table should also have a route to destination 8.8.8.8 or at least a default route, since the default route is dynamically
added by the DHCP for safety reasons it is better to add 8.8.8.8 also in the main table.
```
For a user-created table to be able to resolve the destination, the main routing table should be able to resolve the destination too.
```
```
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /ip/route> print detail Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - inactive, A - active;
c - connect, s - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, d - dhcp, v - vpn, m - modem, y - cop
y;
H - hw-offloaded; + - ecmp

vrf-interface=ether8 suppress-hw-offload=no
```
```
0 As dst-address=8.8.8.8/32 routing-table=main pref-src="" gateway=172.16.1.1
immediate-gw=172.16.1.1%ether8 distance=1 scope=30 target-scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no
```
```
DAc dst-address=172.16.1.0/24 routing-table=main gateway=ether8 immediate-gw=ether8
distance=0 scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no local-address=172.16.1.2%ether8
```
```
DAc dst-address=172.16.2.0/24 routing-table=main gateway=ether7 immediate-gw=ether7
distance=0 scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no local-address=172.16.2.2%ether7
```
```
1 As dst-address=8.8.8.8/32 routing-table=myTable pref-src="" gateway=172.16.2.1
immediate-gw=172.16.2.1%ether7 distance=1 scope=30 target-scope=10 suppress-hw-offload=no
```
But configuration above is not enough, we need a method to force the traffic to actually use our newly created table. RouterOS gives you two options to
choose from:
```
firewall mangle - it gives more control over the criteria to be used to steer traffic, for example, per connection or per packet balancing, etc. For
more info on how to use mangle marking see Firewall Marking examples.
routing rules - a basic set of parameters that can be used to quickly steer traffic. This is the method we are going to use for our example.
```
It is not recommended to use both methods at the same time or you should know exactly what you are doing. If you really do need to use both mangle and
routing rules in the same setup then keep in mind that mangle has higher priority, meaning if the mangle marked traffic can be resolved in the table then
route rules will never see this traffic.
Routing Rules
Routing rules allow steering traffic based on basic parameters like a source address, a destination address, or in-interface as well as other parameters.
For our example, we want to select traffic with destination 8.8.8.8 and do not fall back to the main table:
```
/routing rule add dst-address=8.8.8.8 action=lookup-only-in-table table=myTable
```
Lets's say that we know that customer is connected to ether4 and we want only that customer to route 8.8.8.8 to a specific gateway. We can use the
following rule:
```
/routing rule add dst-address=8.8.8.8 action=lookup-only-in-table table=myTable interface=ether4
```
If for some reason the gateway used in our table goes down, the whole lookup will fail and the destination will not be reachable. In active-backup setups
we want the traffic to be able to fall back to the main table. To do that change the action from lookup-only-in-table to lookup.
Also, routing rules can be used as a very "basic firewall". Let's say we do not want to allow a customer connected to ether4 to be able to access the
192.168.1.0/24 network:
```
/routing rule add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 interface=ether4 action=drop
```
```
Routing table count is limited to 4096 unique tables.
```
List of all the parameters that can be used by routing rules:
```
Property Description
```
```
action (drop | lookup | lookup-only-in-table
| unreachable)
```
```
An action to take on the matching packet:
```
```
drop - silently drop the packet.
lookup - perform a lookup in routing tables.
lookup-only-in-table - perform lookup only in the specified routing table (see table parameter).
unreachable - generate ICMP unreachable message and send it back to the source.
```
```
comment (string)
```
```
disabled (yes | no) The disabled rule is not used.
```
```
dst-address() The destination address of the packet to match.
```
```
interface (string) Incoming interface to match.
```
```
min-prefix (integer [0..4294967295]) Equivalent to Linux IP rule suppress_prefixlength. For example to suppress the default route in the
routing decision set the value to 0.
```
```
routing-mark (string) Match specific routing mark.
```
```
src-address (string) The source address of the packet to match.
```
```
table (name) Name of the routing table to use for lookup.
```

## Description
RouterOS allows to create multiple Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances on a single router. This is useful for BGP-based MPLS VPNs. Unlike BGP
VPLS, which is OSI Layer 2 technology, BGP VRF VPNs work in Layer 3 and as such exchange IP prefixes between routers. VRFs solve the problem of
overlapping IP prefixes and provide the required privacy (via separated routing for different VPNs).
It is possible to set up vrf-lite setups or use multi-protocol BGP with VPNv4 address family to distribute routes from VRF routing tables - not only to other
routers, but also to different routing tables in the router itself.

## Configuration
VRF table is created in /ip vrf menu. After the VRF config is created routing table mapping is added (a dynamic table with the same name is created).
Each active VRF will always have a mapped routing table.
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print
Flags: X - disabled; * - builtin
0 * name="main" interfaces=all
```
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /routing/table> print
Flags: D - dynamic; X - disabled, I - invalid; U - used
0 D name="main" fib
```
Note that the order of the added VRFs is significant. To properly match which interface will belong to the VRF care must be taken to place VRFs in the
correct order (matching is done starting from the top entry, just like firewall rules).
Let's look at the following example:
```
Since each VRF has mapped routing table, count of max unique VRFs is also limited to 4096.
```
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print
Flags: X - disabled; * - builtin
0 * name="main" interfaces=all
1 name="myVrf" interfaces=lo_vrf
```
Since the first entry is matching all the interfaces, the second VRF will not have any interfaces added. To fix the problem order of the entries must be
changed.
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> move 1 0
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/vrf> print
Flags: X - disabled; * - builtin
0 name="myVrf" interfaces=lo_vrf
1 * name="main" interfaces=all
```
Connected routes from the interfaces assigned to the VRF will be installed in the right routing table automatically.
For example, let's make an SSH service to listen for connections on the interfaces belonging to the VRF:
```
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/service> set ssh vrf=myVrf
[admin@arm-bgp] /ip/service> print
Flags: X, I - INVALID
Columns: NAME, PORT, CERTIFICATE, VRF
# NAME PORT CERTIFICATE VRF
0 telnet 23 main
1 ftp 21
2 www 80 main
3 ssh 22 myVrf
4 X www-ssl 443 none main
5 api 8728 main
6 winbox 8291 main
7 api-ssl 8729 none main
```
Adding routes to the VRF is as simple as specifying the routing-table parameter when adding the route and specifying in which routing table to resolve the
gateway by specifying @name after the gateway IP:
```
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@myVrf routing-table=myVrf
```
Traffic leaking between VRFs is possible if the gateway is explicitly set to be resolved in another VRF, for example:
```
# add route in the myVrf, but resolve the gateway in the main table
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=myVrf
```
```
# add route in the main table, but resolve the gateway in the myVrf
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1@myVrf
```
Supported features
Different services can be placed in specific VRF on which the service is listening for incoming or creating outgoing connections. By default, all services are
using the main table, but it can be changed with a separate vrf parameter or by specifying the VRF name separated by "@" at the end of the IP address.
```
When the interface is assigned to the VRF as well as connected routes it does not mean that RouterOS services will magically know which VRF
to use just by specifying the IP address in the configuration. Each service needs VRF support to be added and explicit configuration. Whether
the service has VRF support and has VRF configuration options refer to appropriate service documentation.
```
```
If the gateway configuration does not have an explicitly configured table to be resolved in, then it is considered, that gateway should be resolved
in the "main" table.

VRF interfaces in firewall
Started from version 7.14 when interfaces are added in VRF - virtual VRF interface is created automatically. If it is needed to match traffic which belongs to
VRF interface, VRF virtual interface should be used in firewall filters, for example:
```
/ip vrf add interfaces=ether5 name=vrf5
/ip firewall filter add chain=input in-interface=vrf5 action=accept
```
If there are several interfaces in one VRF but it is needed to match only one of these interfaces - marks should be used. For example:
```
/ip vrf add interface=ether15,ether16 vrf=vrf1516
/ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new in-interface=ether15 new-connection-
mark=input_allow passthrough=yes
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input connection-mark=input_allow
```
Examples
Simple VRF-Lite setup
Let's consider a setup where we need two customer VRFs that require access to the internet:
```
/ip address
add address=172.16.1.2/24 interface=public
add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=ether1
add address=192.168.2.1/24 interface=ether2
```
```
/ip route
add gateway=172.16.1.1
```
```
# add VRF configuration
/ip vrf
add name=cust_a interface=ether1 place-before 0
add name=cust_b interface=ether2 place-before 0
```
```
# add vrf routes
/ip route
add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_a
add gateway=172.16.1.1@main routing-table=cust_b
```
```
# masquerade local source
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=public action=masquerade
```
It might be necessary to ensure that packets coming in the "public" interface can actually reach the correct VRF.
This can be solved by marking new connections originated by the VRF customers and steering the traffic by routing marks of incoming packets on the
"public" interface.
```
Before RouterOS version 7.14, firewall filter rules with the property in/out-interface would apply to interfaces within a VRF instance. Starting
from RouterOS version 7.14, these rules no longer target individual interfaces within a VRF, but rather the VRF interface as a whole.
```
```
# mark new customer connections
/ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new new-connection-mark=\
cust_a_conn src-address=192.168.1.0/24 passthrough=no
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting connection-state=new new-connection-mark=\
cust_b_conn src-address=192.168.2.0/24 passthrough=no
```
```
# mark routing
/ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=cust_a_conn \
in-interface=public new-routing-mark=cust_a
add action=mark-routing chain=prerouting connection-mark=cust_b_conn \
in-interface=public new-routing-mark=cust_b
```
Static inter-VRF routes
In general, it is recommended that all routes between VRF should be exchanged using BGP local import and export functionality. If that is not enough,
static routes can be used to achieve this so-called route leaking.
There are two ways to install a route that has a gateway in a different routing table than the route itself.
The first way is to explicitly specify the routing table in the gateway field when adding a route. This is only possible when leaking a route and gateway from
the "main" routing table to a different routing table (VRF). Example:
```
# add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in 'vrf1' routing table with gateway in the main routing table
add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=10.3.0.1@main routing-table=vrf1
```
The second way is to explicitly specify the interface in the gateway field. The interface specified can belong to a VRF instance. Example:
```
# add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in the main routing table with gateway at 'ether2' VRF interface
add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=10.3.0.1%ether2 routing-table=main
# add route to 5.5.5.0/24 in the main routing table with 'ptp-link-1' VRF interface as gateway
add dst-address=5.5.5.0/24 gateway=ptp-link-1 routing-table=main
```
As can be observed, there are two variations possible - to specify gateway as ip_address%interface or to simply specify an interface. The first should be
used for broadcast interfaces in most cases. The second should be used for point-to-point interfaces, and also for broadcast interfaces, if the route is a
connected route in some VRF. For example, if you have an address 1.2.3.4/24 on interface ether2 that is put in a VRF, there will be a connected route
to 1.2.3.0/24 in that VRF's routing table. It is acceptable to add a static route 1.2.3.0/24 in a different routing table with an interface-only gateway,
even though ether2 is a broadcast interface:
```
add dst-address=1.2.3.0/24 gateway=ether2 routing-table=main
```
Static VRF-Lite Connected route leaking
Sometimes it is necessary to access directly connected resources from another vrf. In our example setup we have two connected networks each in its own
VRF. And we want to allow client1 to be able to access client2.

### +-----------------+
```
|+-vrf1-+ +-vrf2-+|
client1(*.2)-------||ip *.1| |ip *.1||-------client2(*.2)
(10.11.0.0/24) |+------+ +------+| (10.12.0.0/24)
+-----------------+
```
```
/ip address
add address=10.11.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus1
add address=10.12.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus2
```
```
# add VRF configuration
/ip vrf
add name=vrfTest1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 place-before 0
add name=vrfTest2 interface=sfp-sfpplus2 place-before 0
```
We can say that connected network is reachable on specific vrf by setting gateway "interface@vrf"
```
# add vrf routes
/ip route
add dst-address=10.11.0.0/24 gateway="sfp-sfpplus1@vrfTest1" routing-table=vrfTest2
add dst-address=10.12.0.0/24 gateway="sfp-sfpplus2@vrfTest2" routing-table=vrfTest1
```
Verify routes and reachability:
```

Approach with "interface@vrf" gateways works only when router is forwarding packets. To access local vrf addresses we need to route to the vrf interface.

# add vrf routes
/ip route
add dst-address=10.11.0.0/24 gateway=vrfTest1@vrfTest1 routing-table=vrfTest2
add dst-address=10.12.0.0/24 gateway=vrfTest2@vrfTest2 routing-table=vrfTest1
```
```

Dynamic Vrf-Lite route leaking
With large enough setups static route leaking is not sufficient. Let's consider we have the same setup as in static route leaking example plus ipv6
addresses, just for demonstration.
```
/ip address
add address=10.11.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus1
add address=10.12.0.1/24 interface=sfp-sfpplus2
```
```
# add VRF configuration
/ip vrf
add name=vrfTest1 interface=sfp-sfpplus1 place-before 0
add name=vrfTest2 interface=sfp-sfpplus2 place-before 0
```
```
/ipv6 address
add address=2001:1::1 advertise=no interface=sfp-sfpplus1
add address=2001:2::1 advertise=no interface=sfp-sfpplus2
```
We can use BGP VPN to leak local routes without actually establishing BGP session.
```
/routing bgp vpn
add export.redistribute=connected .route-targets=1:1 import.route-targets=1:2 label-allocation-policy=per-vrf
name=bgp-mpls-vpn-1 \
route-distinguisher=1.2.3.4:1 vrf=vrfTest1
add export.redistribute=connected .route-targets=1:2 import.route-targets=1:1 label-allocation-policy=per-vrf
name=bgp-mpls-vpn-2 \
route-distinguisher=1.2.3.4:1 vrf=vrfTest2
```
```
Be careful with import/export route targets, if not set up properly local vrf routes from itself will be imported.
```
Now we can see that connected routes between VRFs are exchanged
```

Dynamic Vrf-Lite route leaking (old workaround)
Before ROS v7.14 there were no mechanism to leak routes from one VRF instance to another within the same router.
As a workaround, it was possible to create a tunnel between two locally configure loopback addresses and assign each tunnel endpoint to its own VRF.
Then it is possible to run either dynamic routing protocols or set up static routes to leak between both VRFs.
The downside of this approach is that tunnel must be created between each VRF where routes should be leaked (create a full mesh), which significantly
complicates configuration even if there are just several VRFs, not to mention more complicated setups.
For example, to leak routes between 5 VRFs it would require n * ( n – 1) / 2 connections, which will lead to the setup with 20 tunnel endpoints and 20
OSPF instances on one router.
Example config with two VRFs of this method:
```
/interface bridge
add name=dummy_custC
add name=dummy_custB
add name=lo1
add name=lo2
```
```
/ip address

Let's take a closer look at IP routes in cust-one VRF. The 10.1.1.0/24 IP prefix is a connected route that belongs to an interface that was configured to
belong to cust-one VRF. The 10.3.3.0/24 IP prefix was advertised via BGP as a VPNv4 route from PE2 and is imported in this VRF routing table, because
our configured import-route-targets matched the BGP extended communities attribute it was advertised with.

A more complicated setup (changes only)
As opposed to the simplest setup, in this example, we have two customers: cust-one and cust-two.
We configure two VPNs for them, cust-one and cust-two respectively, and exchange all routes between them. (This is also called "route leaking").
Note that this could be not the most typical setup, because routes are usually not exchanged between different customers. In contrast, by default, it should
not be possible to gain access from one VRF site to a different VRF site in another VPN. (This is the "Private" aspect of VPNs.) Separate routing is a way
to provide privacy, and it is also required to solve the problem of overlapping IP network prefixes. Route exchange is in direct conflict with these two
requirements but may sometimes be needed (e.g. temp. solution when two customers are migrating to a single network infrastructure).

```
The routes 10.3.3.0/24 and 10.4.4.0/24 are also installed in both VRF routing tables. Each is a connected route in one table and a BGP route in another
table. This has nothing to do with their being advertised via BGP. They are simply being "advertised" to the local VPNv4 route table and locally reimported
after that. Import and export route-targets determine in which tables they will end up.
This can be deduced from its attributes - they don't have the usual BGP properties. (Route 10.4.4.0/24.)

## Overview
OSPF is Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) designed to distribute routing information between routers belonging to the same Autonomous System (AS).
The protocol is based on link-state technology that has several advantages over distance-vector protocols such as RIP:
```
no hop count limitations;
multicast addressing is used to send routing information updates;
updates are sent only when network topology changes occur;
the logical definition of networks where routers are divided into areas
transfers and tags external routes injected into AS.
```
However, there are a few disadvantages:
```
OSPF is quite CPU and memory intensive due to the SPF algorithm and maintenance of multiple copies of routing information;
more complex protocol to implement compared to RIP;
```
RouterOS implements the following standards:
```
RFC 2328 - OSPF Version 2
RFC 3101 - The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) Option
RFC 3630 - Traffic Engineering (TE) Extensions to OSPF Version 2

```
OSPF Terminology
Before we move on let's familiarise ourselves with terms important for understanding the operation of the OSPF. These terms will be used throughout the
article.
```
Neighbor - connected (adjacent) router that is running OSPF with the adjacent interface assigned to the same area. Neighbors are found by Hello
packets (unless manually configured).
Adjacency - logical connection between a router and its corresponding DR and BDR. No routing information is exchanged unless adjacencies are
formed.
Link - link refers to a network or router interface assigned to any given network.
Interface - physical interface on the router. The interface is considered a link when it is added to OSPF. Used to build link database.
LSA - Link State Advertisement, data packet contains link-state and routing information, that is shared among OSPF Neighbors.
DR - Designated Router, chosen router to minimize the number of adjacencies formed. The option is used in broadcast networks.
BDR -Backup Designated Router, hot standby for the DR. BDR receives all routing updates from adjacent routers, but it does not flood LSA
updates.
Area - areas are used to establish a hierarchical network.
ABR - Area Border Router, router connected to multiple areas. ABRs are responsible for summarization and update suppression between
connected areas.
ASBR - Autonomous System Boundary Router, router connected to an external network (in a different AS). If you import other protocol routes into
OSPF from the router it is now considered ASBR.
NBMA - Non-broadcast multi-access, networks allow multi-access but have no broadcast capability. Additional OSPF neighbor configuration is
required for those networks.
Broadcast - Network that allows broadcasting, for example, Ethernet.
Point-to-point - Network type eliminates the need for DRs and BDRs
Router-ID - IP address used to identify the OSPF router. If the OSPF Router-ID is not configured manually, a router uses one of the IP addresses
assigned to the router as its Router-ID.
Link State - The term link-state refers to the status of a link between two routers. It defines the relationship between a router's interface and its
neighboring routers.
Cost - Link-state protocols assign a value to each link called cost. the cost value depends on the speed of the media. A cost is associated with the
outside of each router interface. This is referred to as interface output cost.
Autonomous System - An autonomous system is a group of routers that use a common routing protocol to exchange routing information.
```
Basic Configuration Example
To start OSPF v2 and v3 instances, the first thing to do is to add the instance and the backbone area:
```
/routing ospf instance
add name=v2inst version=2 router-id=1.2.3.4
add name=v3inst version=3 router-id=1.2.3.4
/routing ospf area
add name=backbone_v2 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v2inst
add name=backbone_v3 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v3inst
```
At this point, we can add a template. The template is used to match interfaces on which OSPF should be running, it can be done either by specifying the
network or interface directly.
```
/routing ospf interface-template
add networks=192.168.0.0/24 area=backbone_v2
add networks=2001:db8::/64 area=backbone_v3
add interfaces=ether1 area=backbone_v3
```
Routing Table Calculation
Link state database describes the routers and links that interconnect them and are appropriate for forwarding. It also contains the cost (metric) of each link.
This metric is used to calculate the shortest path to the destination network.
Each router can advertise a different cost for the router's own link direction, making it possible to have asymmetric links (packets to the destination travel
over one path, but the response travels a different path). Asymmetric paths are not very popular, because it makes it harder to find routing problems.
The value of the cost can be changed in the OSPF interface template configuration menu, for example, to add an ether2 interface with a cost of 100:
```
/routing ospf interface-template
add interfaces=ether2 cost=100 area=backbone_v2
```
The cost of an interface on Cisco routers is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of that interface. A higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. If similar
costs are necessary on RouterOS, then use the following formula:
Cost = 100000000/bw in bps.
OSPF router is using Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate the shortest path. The algorithm places the router at the root of a tree and
calculates the shortest path to each destination based on the cumulative cost required to reach the destination. Each router calculates its own tree even
though all routers are using the same link-state database.
SPT Calculation
Assume we have the following network. The network consists of 4(four) routers. OSPF costs for outgoing interfaces are shown near the line that
represents the link. In order to build the shortest-path tree for router R1, we need to make R1 the root and calculate the smallest cost for each destination.
As you can see from the image above multiple shortest paths have been found to the 172.16.1.0 network, allowing load balancing of the traffic to that
destination called equal-cost multipath (ECMP). After the shortest-path tree is built, a router starts to build the routing table accordingly. Networks are
reached consequently to the cost calculated in the tree.
Routing table calculation looks quite simple, however, when some of the OSPF extensions are used or OSPF areas are calculated, routing calculation gets
more complicated.
Forwarding Address
OSPF router can set the forwarding-address to something other than itself which indicates that an alternate next-hop is possible. Mostly forwarding
address is set to 0.0.0.0 suggesting that the route is reachable only via the advertising router.
The forwarding address is set in LSA if the following conditions are met:
```
OSPF must be enabled on the next-hop interface
Next-hop address falls into the network provided by OSPF networks
```
A router that receives such LSA can use a forwarding address if OSPF is able to resolve the forwarding address. If forwarding address is not resolved
directly - router sets nexthop for forwading address from LSA as a gateway, if forwarding address is not resolved at all - the gateway will be originator-id.
Resolve happens only using OSPF instance routes, not the whole routing table.
Let's look at the example setup below:
Router R1 has a static route to the external network 192.168.0.0/24. OSPF is running between R1, R2, and R3, and the static route is distributed across
the OSPF network.
The problem in such a setup is obvious, R2 can not reach the external network directly. Traffic going to the LAN network from R2 will be forwarded over
the router R1, but if we look at the network diagram we can see that more R2 can directly reach the router where the LAN network i located.
So knowing the forwarding address conditions, we can make router R1 to set the forwarding address. We simply need to add 10.1.101.0/24 network to
OSPF networks in the router's R1 configuration:
```
/routing/ospf/interface-template add area=backbone_v2 networks=10.1.101.0/24
```
Now lets verify that forwarding address is actually working:
```
[admin@r2] /ip/route> print where dst-address=192.168.0.0/24
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; A - ACTIVE; o, y - COPY
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY DISTANCE
DAo 192.168.0.0/24 10.1.101.1%ether1 110
```
On all OSPF routers you will see LSA set with forwarding address other than 0.0.0.0
```
[admin@r2] /routing/ospf/lsa> print where id=192.168.0.0
Flags: S - self-originated, F - flushing, W - wraparound; D - dynamic
```
```
1 D instance=default_ip4 type="external" originator=10.1.101.10 id=192.168.0.0
sequence=0x80000001 age=19 checksum=0xF336 body=
options=E
netmask=255.255.255.0
forwarding-address=10.1.101.1
metric=10 type-1
route-tag=0
```
```
OSPF adjacency between routers in the 10.1.101.0/24 network is not required
```
Neighbour Relationship and Adjacency
OSPF is a link-state protocol that assumes that the interface of the router is considered an OSPF link. Whenever OSPF is started, it adds the state of all
the links in the local link-state database.
There are several steps before the OSPF network becomes fully functional:
```
Neighbors discovery
Database Synchronization
Routing calculation
```
Link-state routing protocols are distributing and replicating database that describes the routing topology. The link-state protocol's flooding algorithm
ensures that each router has an identical link-state database and the routing table is calculated based on this database.
After all the steps above are completed link-state database on each neighbor contains full routing domain topology (how many other routers are in the
network, how many interfaces routers have, what networks link between router connects, cost of each link, and so on).
Communication Between OSPF Routers
OSPF operates over the IP network layer using protocol number 89.
A destination IP address is set to the neighbor's IP address or to one of the OSPF multicast addresses AllSPFRouters (224.0.0.5) or AllDRRouters
(224.0.0.6). The use of these addresses is described later in this article.
Every OSPF packet begins with a standard 24-byte header.
```
Field Description
```
```
Packet
type
```
```
There are several types of OSPF packets: Hello packet, Database Description (DD) packet, Link state request packet, Link State Update
packet, and Link State Acknowledgement packet. All of these packets except the Hello packet are used in link-state database
synchronization.
```
```
Router
ID
```
```
one of the router's IP addresses unless configured manually
```
```
Area ID Allows OSPF router to associate the packet to the proper OSPF area.
```
```
ChecksumAllows receiving router to determine if a packet was damaged in transit.
```
```
Authenti
cation
fields
```
```
These fields allow the receiving router to verify that the packet's contents were not modified and that packet really came from the OSPF
router whose Router ID appears in the packet.
```
There are five different OSPF packet types used to ensure proper LSA flooding over the OSPF network.
```
Hello packet - used to discover OSPF neighbors and build adjacencies.
Database Description (DD) - check for Database synchronization between routers. Exchanged after adjacencies are built.
Link-State Request (LSR) - used to request up-to-date pieces of the neighbor's database. Out-of-date parts of the routing database are
determined after the DD exchange.
```
```
Link-State Update (LSU) - carries a collection of specifically requested link-state records.
Link-State Acknowledgment (LSack) - is used to acknowledge other packet types that way introducing reliable communication.
```
Neighbors Discovery
OSPF discovers potential neighbors by periodically sending Hello packets out of configured interfaces. By default Hello packets are sent out at 10-second
intervals which can be changed by setting hello-interval in OSPF interface settings. The router learns the existence of a neighboring router when it receives
the neighbor's Hello in return with matching parameters.
The transmission and reception of Hello packets also allow a router to detect the failure of the neighbor. If Hello packets are not received within dead-
interval (which by default is 40 seconds) router starts to route packets around the failure. "Hello" protocol ensures that the neighboring routers agree on the
Hello interval and Dead interval parameters, preventing situations when not in time received Hello packets mistakenly bring the link down.
```
Field Description
```
```
network mask The IP mask of the originating router's interface IP address.
```
```
hello interval the period between Hello packets (default 10s)
```
```
options OSPF options for neighbor information
```
```
router priority an 8-bit value used to aid in the election of the DR and BDR. (Not set in p2p links)
```
```
router dead interval time interval has to be received before considering the neighbor is down. ( By default four times bigger than the Hello interval)
```
```
DR the router-id of the current DR
```
```
BDR the router-id of the current BDR
```
```
Neighbor router IDs a list of router ids for all the originating router's neighbors
```
On each type of network segment Hello protocol works a little differently. It is clear that on point-to-point segments only one neighbor is possible and no
additional actions are required. However, if more than one neighbor can be on the segment additional actions are taken to make OSPF functionality even
more efficient.
Two routers do not become neighbors unless the following conditions are met.
```
Two-way communication between routers is possible. Determined by flooding Hello packets.
The interface should belong to the same area;
The interface should belong to the same subnet and have the same network mask unless it has network-type configured as point-to-point;
Routers should have the same authentication options, and have to exchange the same password (if any);
Hello and Dead intervals should be the same in Hello packets;
External routing and NSSA flags should be the same in Hello packets.
```
Discovery on Broadcast Subnets
```
Network mask, Priority, DR, and BDR fields are used only when the neighbors are connected by a broadcast or NBMA network segment.
```
The attached node to the broadcast subnet can send a single packet and that packet is received by all other attached nodes. This is very useful for auto-
configuration and information replication. Another useful capability in broadcast subnets is multicast. This capability allows sending a single packet which
will be received by nodes configured to receive multicast packets. OSPF is using this capability to find OSPF neighbors and detect bidirectional
connectivity.
Each OSPF router joins the IP multicast group AllSPFRouters (224.0.0.5), then the router periodically multicasts its Hello packets to the IP address
224.0.0.5. All other routers that joined the same group will receive a multicasted Hello packet. In that way, OSPF routers maintain relationships with all
other OSPF routers by sending a single packet instead of sending a separate packet to each neighbor on the segment.
This approach has several advantages:
Automatic neighbor discovery by multicasting or broadcasting Hello packets. Less bandwidth usage compared to other subnet types. On the broadcast
segment, there are n*(n-1)/2 neighbor relations, but those relations are maintained by sending only n Hellos. If the broadcast has the multicast capability,
then OSPF operates without disturbing non-OSPF nodes on the broadcast segment. If the multicast capability is not supported all routers will receive
broadcasted Hello packets even if the node is not an OSPF router.
Discovery on NBMA Subnets
Non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) segments are similar to broadcast. Support more than two routers, the only difference is that NBMA does not support
a data-link broadcast capability. Due to this limitation, OSPF neighbors must be discovered initially through configuration. On RouterOS static neighbor
configuration is set in the /routing ospf static-neighbor menu. To reduce the amount of Hello traffic, most routers attached to the NBMA subnet
should be assigned a Router Priority of 0 (set by default in RouterOS). Routers that are eligible to become Designated Routers should have priority values
other than 0. It ensures that during the election of DR and BDR Hellos are sent only to eligible routers.
Discovery on PTMP Subnets
Point-to-MultiPoint treats the network as a collection of point-to-point links.
By design, PTMP networks should not have broadcast capabilities, which means that OSPF neighbors (the same way as for NBMA networks) must be
discovered initially through configuration and all communication happens by sending unicast packets directly between neighbors. On RouterOS static
neighbor configuration is set in the /routing ospf static-neighbor menu. Designated Routers and Backup Designated Routers are not elected on
Point-to-multipoint subnets.
For PTMP networks that do support broadcast, a hybrid type named "ptmp-broadcast" can be used. This network type uses multicast Hellos to discover
neighbors automatically and detect bidirectional communication between neighbors. After neighbor detection "ptmp-broacast" sends unicast packets
directly to the discovered neighbors. This mode is compatible with the RouterOS v6 "ptmp" type.
Master-Slave Relation
Before database synchronization can begin, a hierarchy order of exchanging information must be established, which determines which router sends Databa
se Descriptor (DD) packets first (Master). The master router is elected based on the highest priority and if priority is not set then the router ID will be used.
Note that it is a router priority-based relation to arranging the exchanging data between neighbors which does not affect DR/BDR election (meaning that DR
does not always have to be Master).
Database Synchronization
Link-state Database synchronization between OSPF routers is very important. Unsynchronized databases may lead to incorrectly calculated routing tables
which could cause routing loops or black holes.
There are two types of database synchronizations:
```
initial database synchronization
reliable flooding.
```
When the connection between two neighbors first comes up, initial database synchronization will happen. OSPF is using explicit database download when
neighbor connections first come up. This procedure is called Database exchange. Instead of sending the entire database, the OSPF router sends only its
LSA headers in a sequence of OSPF Database Description (DD) packets. The router will send the next DD packet only when the previous packet is
acknowledged. When an entire sequence of DD packets has been received, the router knows which LSAs it does not have and which LSAs are more
recent. The router then sends Link-State Request (LSR) packets requesting desired LSAs, and the neighbor responds by flooding LSAs in Link-State
Update (LSU) packets. After all the updates are received neighbors are said to be fully adjacent.
Reliable flooding is another database synchronization method. It is used when adjacencies are already established and the OSPF router wants to inform
other routers about LSA changes. When the OSPF router receives such Link State Update, it installs a new LSA in the link-state database, sends an
acknowledgment packet back to the sender, repackages LSA in new LSU, and sends it out to all interfaces except the one that received the LSA in the first
place.
OSPF determines if LSAs are up to date by comparing sequence numbers. Sequence numbers start with 0×80000001, the larger the number, the more
recent the LSA is. A sequence number is incremented each time the record is flooded and the neighbor receiving the update resets the Maximum age
timer. LSAs are refreshed every 30 minutes, but without a refresh, LSA remains in the database for the maximum age of 60 minutes.
Databases are not always synchronized between all OSPF neighbors, OSPF decides whether databases need to be synchronized depending on the
network segment, for example, on point-to-point links databases are always synchronized between routers, but on Ethernet networks databases are
synchronized between certain neighbor pairs.
Synchronization on Broadcast Subnets
On the broadcast segment, there are n*(n-1)/2 neighbor relations, it will be a huge amount of Link State Updates and Acknowledgements sent over the
subnet if the OSPF router will try to synchronize with each OSPF router on the subnet.
This problem is solved by electing one Designated Router and one Backup Designated Router for each broadcast subnet. All other routers are
synchronizing and forming adjacencies only with those two elected routers. This approach reduces the number of adjacencies from n*(n-1)/2 to only 2n-3.
The image on the right illustrates adjacency formations on broadcast subnets. Routers R1 and R2 are Designated Routers and Backup Designated routers
respectively. For example, if R3 wants to flood Link State Update (LSU) to both R1 and R2, a router sends LSU to the IP multicast address AllDRouters
(224.0.0.6) and only DR and BDR listen to this multicast address. Then Designated Router sends LSU addressed to AllSPFRouters, updating the rest of
the routers.
DR Election
DR and BDR routers are elected from data received in the Hello packet. The first OSPF router on a subnet is always elected as Designated Router, when
a second router is added it becomes Backup Designated Router. When an existing DR or BDR fails new DR or BDR is elected to take into account
configured router priority. The router with the highest priority becomes the new DR or BDR.
Being Designated Router or Backup Designated Router consumes additional resources. If Router Priority is set to 0, then the router is not participating in
the election process. This is very useful if certain slower routers are not capable of being DR or BDR.
Synchronization on NBMA Subnets
Database synchronization on NBMA networks is similar to that on broadcast networks. DR and BDR are elected, databases initially are exchanged only
with DR and BDR routers and flooding always goes through the DR. The only difference is that Link State Updates must be replicated and sent to each
adjacent router separately.
Synchronization on PTMP Subnets
On PTMP subnets OSPF router becomes adjacent to all other routes with which it can communicate directly.
Understanding OSPF Areas
A distinctive feature of OSPF is the possibility to divide AS into multiple routing Areas which contain their own set of neighbors.
Imagine a large network with 300+ routers and multiple links between them. Whenever link flaps or some other topology change happens in the network,
this change will be flooded to all OSPF devices in the network resulting in a quite heavy load on the network and even downtime since network
convergence may take some time for such a large network.
A large single-area network can produce serious issues:
```
Each router recalculates the database every time whenever network topology change occurs, the process takes CPU resources.
Each router holds an entire link-state database, which shows the topology of the entire network, it takes memory resources.
A complete copy of the routing table and a number of routing table entries may be significantly greater than the number of networks, which can
take even more memory resources.
Updating large databases requires more bandwidth.
```
The introduction of areas allows for better resource management since topology change inside one area is not flooded to other areas in the network. The
concept of areas enables simplicity in network administration as well as routing summarization between areas significantly reducing the database size that
needs to be stored on each OSPF neighbor. This means that each area has its own link-state database and corresponding shortest-path tree.
The structure of an area is invisible to other areas. This isolation of knowledge makes the protocol more scalable if multiple areas are used; routing table
calculation takes fewer CPU resources and routing traffic is reduced.
However, multi-area setups create additional complexity. It is not recommended to separate areas with fewer than 50 routers. The maximum number of
routers in one area is mostly dependent on the CPU power you have for routing table calculation.
OSPF area has unique 32-bit identification (Area ID) and the area with an Area ID of 0.0.0.0 (called the Backbone area) is the main one where any other
area should connect. Routers that connect to more than one area are called ABR (Area Border Routers), and their main responsibility is summarization
and update suppression between connected areas. The router connecting to another routing domain is called ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary
Router).
Each area has its own link-state database, consisting of router-LSAs and network-LSAs describing how all routers within that area are interconnected.
Detailed knowledge of the area's topology is hidden from all other areas; router-LSAs and network-LSAs are not flooded beyond the area's borders. Area
Border Routers (ABRs) leak addressing information from one area into another in OSPF summary-LSAs. This allows one to pick the best area border
router when forwarding data to destinations from another area and is called intra-area routing.
Routing information exchange between areas is essentially a Distance Vector algorithm and to prevent algorithm convergence problems, such as counting
to infinity, all areas are required to attach directly to the backbone area making a simple hub-and-spoke topology. The area-ID of the backbone area is
always 0.0.0.0 and can not be changed.
RouterOS area configuration is done in the /routing/ospf/area menu.  For example, a configuration of an ABR router with multiple attached areas,
one Stub area, and one default area:
```
/routing ospf area
add name=backbone_v2 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v2inst
add name=stub_area area-id=1.1.1.1 instance=v2inst type=stub
add name=another_area area-id=2.2.2.2 instance=v2inst type=default
```
OSPF can have 5 types of areas. Each area type defines what type of LSAs the area supports:
```
standard/default - OSPF packets can normally be transmitted in this area, it supports types 1,2,3,4 and 5 LSAs
backbone - as already mentioned this is the main area where any other area connects. It is basically the same as the standard area but identified
with ID 0.0.0.0
stub - this area does not accept any external routes
totally stubby - a variation of the stub area
not-so-stubby (NSSA) - a variation of the stub area
```
LSA Types
Before we continue a detailed look at each area type, let's get familiar with LSA types:
```
type 1 - (Router LSA) Sent by routers within the Area, including the list of directly attached links. Do not cross the ABR or ASBR.
type 2 - (Network LSA) Generated for every "transit network" within an area. A transit network has at least two directly attached OSPF routers.
Ethernet is an example of a Transit Network. A Type 2 LSA lists each of the attached routers that make up the transit network and is generated by
the DR.
type 3 - (Summary LSA) The ABR sends Type 3 Summary LSAs. A Type 3 LSA advertises any networks owned by an area to the rest of the
areas in the OSPF AS. By default, OSPF advertises Type 3 LSAs for every subnet defined in the originating area, which can cause flooding
problems, so it ́s a good idea to use a manual summarization at the ABR.
type 4 - (ASBR-Summary LSA) It announces the ASBR address, it shows “where” the ASBR is located, announcing its address instead of its
routing table.
type 5 - (External LSA) Announces the Routes learned through the ASBR, are flooded to all areas except Stub areas. This LSA divides into two
sub-types: external type 1 and external type 2.
type 6 - (Group Membership LSA) This was defined for Multicast extensions to OSPF and is not used by RouterOS.
type 7 - type 7 LSAs are used to tell the ABRs about these external routes imported into the NSSA area. Area Border Router then translates
these LSAs to type 5 external LSAs and floods as normal to the rest of the OSPF network
type 8 - External Attributes LSA (OSPFv2) / link-local LSA (OSPFv3)
type 9 - Link-Local Scope Opaque (OSPFv2) / Intra Area Prefix LSA (OSPFv3). LSA of this type is not flooded beyond the local (sub)network.
type 10 - Area Local Scope Opaque. LSA of this type is not flooded beyond the scope of its associated area.
type 11 - Opaque LSA which is flooded throughout the AS (scope is the same as type 5). It is not flooded in stub areas and NSSAs.
```
Standard Area
```
If we do not have any ASBR, there are no LSA Types 4 and 5 in the network.
```
This area supports 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 LSAs.
Simple multi-area network using default area. In this example, all networks from area1 are flooded to the backbone and all networks from the backbone are
flooded to area1.

Stub Area
The main purpose of stub areas is to keep such areas from carrying external routes. Routing from these areas to the outside world is based on a default
route. A stub area reduces the database size inside an area and reduces the memory requirements of routers in the area.
The stub area has a few restrictions, ASBR routers cannot be internal to the area, stub area cannot be used as a transit area for virtual links. The
restrictions are made because the stub area is mainly configured not to carry external routes.
This area supports 1, 2, and 3 LSAs.
Let's consider the example above. Area1 is configured as a stub area meaning that routers R2 and R3 will not receive any routing information from the
backbone area except the default route.

### R1:
```
/routing ospf instance
add name=v2inst version=2 router-id=1.0.0.1
/routing ospf area
add name=backbone_v2 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v2inst

```

### R3:

/routing ospf area
add name=area1 area-id=1.1.1.1 type=stub instance=v2inst
/routing ospf interface-template
add networks=10.0.3.0/24 area=area1
```
Totally Stubby Area
Totally stubby area is an extension of the stub area. A totally stubby area blocks external routes and summarized (inter-area) routes from going into the
area. Only intra-area routes are injected into the area. Totally stubby area is configured as a stub area with an additional no-summaries flag. This area
supports Type 1, Type 2 LSAs, and Type 3 LSAs with default routes.
```
/routing ospf area
add name=totally_stubby_area area-id=1.1.1.1 instance=v2inst type=stub no-summaries
```
NSSA
Not-so-stubby area (NSSA) is useful when it is required to inject external routes, but injection of type 5 LSA routes is not required.
The illustration shows two areas (backbone and area1) and RIP connection to the router located in "area1". We need "area1" to be configured as a stub
area, but it is also required to inject external RIP routes in the backbone. Area1 should be configured as NSSA in this case.
The configuration example does not cover RIP configuration.

### R1:
```
/routing ospf instance
add name=v2inst version=2 router-id=1.0.0.1
/routing ospf area
add name=backbone_v2 area-id=0.0.0.0 instance=v2inst

```

### R2:

/routing ospf area

/routing ospf interface-template
add networks=10.0.1.0/24 area=area1
```
External Routing Information and Default Route
On the edge of an OSPF routing domain, you can find routers called AS boundary routers (ASBRs) that run one of the other routing protocols. The job of
those routers is to import routing information learned from other routing protocols into the OSPF routing domain. External routes can be imported at two
separate levels depending on the metric type.
```
Virtual links cannot be used over NSSA areas.
```
```
type1 - OSPF metric is the sum of the internal OSPF cost and the external route cost
type2 - OSPF metric is equal only to the external route cost.
```
External routes can be imported via the instance redistribute parameter. The example below will pick and redistribute all static and RIP routes:
```
/routing ospf instance
add name=v2inst version=2 router-id=1.2.3.4 redistribute=static,rip
```
Redistribution of default route is a special case where the originate-default the parameter should be used:
```
/routing ospf instance
set v2inst originate-default=if-installed
```
Since redistribution is controlled by "originate-default" and "redistribute" parameter, it introduces some corner-cases for default route filtering.
```
if redistribute is enabled, then pick all routes matching redistribute parameters
If originate-default=never, a default route will be rejected
run selected routes through out-select-chain (if configured)
run selected routes through out-filter-chain (if configured)
if originate-default is set to always or if-installed:
OSPF creates a fake default route without attributes;
runs this route through out-filter-chain where attributes can be applied, but action is ignored (always accept);
```
For a complete list of redistribution values, see the reference manual.
Route Summarisation
Route summarization is a consolidation of multiple routes into one single advertisement. It is normally done at the area boundaries (Area Border Routers).
It is better to summarise in the direction of the backbone. That way the backbone receives all the aggregated routes and injects them into other areas
already summarized. There are two types of summarization: inter-area and external route summarization.
Inter-area route summarization works on area boundaries (ABRs), it does not apply to external routes injected into OSPF via redistribution. By default,
ABR creates a summary LSA for each route in a specific area and advertises it in adjacent areas.
Using ranges allows for creating only one summary LSA for multiple routes and sending only a single advertisement into adjacent areas, or suppressing
advertisements altogether.
If a range is configured with the 'advertise' parameter, a single summary LSA is advertised for each range if there are any routes under the range in the
specific area. Otherwise (when 'advertise' parameter disabled) no summary LSAs are created and advertised outside area boundaries at all.
Inter-area route summarization can be configured from the OSPF area range menu.
Let's consider that we have two areas backbone and area1, area1 has several /24 routes from the 10.0.0.0/16 range and there is no need to flood the
backbone area with each /24 subnet if it can be summarized. On the router connecting area1 with the backbone we can set up the area range:
```
/routing ospf area range
add prefix=10.0.0.0/16 area=area1 advertise=yes cost=10
```
External route summarization can be achieved using routing filters.  Let's consider the same example as above except that area1 has redistributed /24
routes from other protocols. To send a single summarised LSA, a blackhole route must be added and an appropriate routing filter to accept only
summarised route:
```
For an active range (i.e. one that has at least one OSPF route from the specified area falling under it), a route with the type 'blackhole' is created
and installed in the routing table.
```
```
/ip route add dst-address=10.0.0.0/16 blackhole
/routing ospf instance
set v2inst out-filter-chain=ospf_out
/routing filter rule
add chain=ospf_out rule="if (dst == 10.0.0.0/16) {accept} else {reject}"
```
Virtual Link
As it was mentioned previously all OSPF areas have to be attached to the backbone area, but sometimes the physical connection is not possible. To
overcome this, areas can be attached logically by using virtual links.
There are two common scenarios when virtual links can be used:
```
to glue together the fragmented backbone area
to connect remote are without direct connection to the backbone
```
Partitioned Backbone
OSPF allows to linking of discontinuous parts of the backbone area using virtual links. This might be required when two separate OSPF networks are
merged into one large network. Virtual links can be configured between separate ABRs that touch the backbone area from each side and have a common
area.
The additional area could be created to become a transit area when a common area does not exist, it is illustrated in the image above.
Virtual Links are not required for non-backbone areas when they get partitioned. OSPF does not actively attempt to repair area partitions, each component
simply becomes a separate area, when an area becomes partitioned. The backbone performs routing between the new areas. Some destinations are
reachable via intra-area routing, the area partition requires inter-area routing.
However, to maintain full routing after the partition, an address range has not to be split across multiple components of the area partition.
No physical connection to a backbone
The area may not have a physical connection to the backbone, a virtual link is used to provide a logical path to the backbone of the disconnected area. A
link has to be established between two ABRs that have a common area with one ABR connected to the backbone.
We can see that both R1 and R2 routers are ABRs and R1 is connected to the backbone area. Area2 will be used as a transit area and R1 is the entry point
into the backbone area. A virtual link has to be configured on both routers.
Virtual link configuration is added in OSPF interface templates. If we take the example setup from the "no physical connection" illustration, then the virtual
link configuration would look like this:
R1:
```
/routing ospf interface-template
add vlink-transit-area=area2 area=backbone_v2 type=virtual-link vlink-neighbor-id=2.2.2.2
```

### R2:
```
/routing ospf interface-template
add vlink-transit-area=area2 area=backbone_v2 type=virtual-link vlink-neighbor-id=1.1.1.1

```
priority (integer: 0..255;
Default:  128 )

value takes precedence. Priority value 0 means the router is not eligible to become a designated or backup
designated router at all.
```
```
retransmit-interval (time;
Default: 5s)
```
```
Time interval the lost link state advertisement will be resent. When a router sends a link state advertisement (LSA) to
its neighbor, the LSA is kept until the acknowledgment is received. If the acknowledgment was not received in time
(see transmit-delay), the router will try to retransmit the LSA.
```
```

virtual-link; Default: broadcast)
```
```
the OSPF network type on this interface. Note that if interface configuration does not exist, the default network type is
'point-to-point' on PtP interfaces and 'broadcast' on all other interfaces.
```
```
broadcast - network type suitable for Ethernet and other multicast capable link layers. Elects designated router
nbma - Non-Broadcast Multiple Access. Protocol packets are sent to each neighbor's unicast address. Requires
manual configuration of neighbors. Elects designated router
ptp - suitable for networks that consist only of two nodes. Do not elect designated router
ptmp - Point-to-Multipoint. Easier to configure than NBMA because it requires no manual configuration of a
neighbor. Do not elect a designated router. This is the most robust network type and as such suitable for wireless
networks, if 'broadcast' mode does not work well enough for them
ptp-unnumbered - works the same as ptp, except that the remote neighbor does not have an associated IP
address to a specific PTP interface. For example, in case an IP unnumbered is used on Cisco devices.
virtual-link - for virtual link setups.

```
```
Down - No Hello packets have been received from a neighbor.
Attempt - Applies only to NBMA clouds. The state indicates that no recent information was received from a
neighbor.
Init - Hello packet received from the neighbor, but bidirectional communication is not established (Its own
RouterID is not listed in the Hello packet).
2-way - This state indicates that bi-directional communication is established. DR and BDR elections occur
during this state, routers build adjacencies based on whether the router is DR or BDR, and the link is point-to-
point or a virtual link.
ExStart - Routers try to establish the initial sequence number that is used for the packet information exchange.
The router with a higher ID becomes the master and starts the exchange.
Exchange - Routers exchange database description (DD) packets.
Loading - In this state actual link state information is exchanged. Link State Request packets are sent to
neighbors to request any new LSAs that were found during the Exchange state.
Full - Adjacency is complete, and neighbor routers are fully adjacent. LSA information is synchronized between
adjacent routers. Routers achieve the full state with their DR and BDR only, an exception is P2P links.

## Summary
MikroTik RouterOS implements RIP version 2 (RFC 2453). Version 1 (RFC 1058) is not supported.
RIP enables routers in an autonomous system to exchange routing information. It always uses the best path (the path with the fewest number of hops (i.e.
routers)) available.

## General
Sub-menu: /routing rip instance
```
Property Description
```
```
name name of the instance
```
```
vrf ( Default: main) which VRF to use
```
```
afi (ipv4 | ipv6; Default: ) specifies which afi to use.
```
```
in-filter-chain (Default: ) input filter chain
```
```
out-filter-chain (Default: ) output filter chain
```
```
out-filter-select (Default: ) output filter select rule chain
```
```
redistribute (bgp, bgp-mpls-vpn, connected, dhcp, fantasy, modem, ospf, rip, static, vpn;
Default: )
```
```
which routes to redistribute
```
```
originate-default ( Default:) whether to originate default route
```
```
routing-table ( Default: main) in which routing table the routes will be added
```
```
route-timeout (Default: ) route timeout
```
```
route-gc-timeout  (Default: )
```
```
update-interval (time; Default: ) specifies time interval after which the route is considered
invalid
```
Note: The maximum metric of RIP route is 15. Metric higher than 15 is considered 'infinity' and routes with such metric are considered unreachable. Thus
RIP cannot be used on networks with more than 15 hops between any two routers, and using redistribute metrics larger that 1 further reduces this
maximum hop count.

## Summary
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows setting up an inter-domain dynamic routing system that automatically updates routing tables of devices running
BGP in case of network topology changes.
BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm. It is used to exchange routing information across the Internet
and is the only protocol that is designed to deal with a network of the Internet's size and the only protocol that can deal well with having multiple
connections to unrelated routing domains.
BGP is designed to allow for sophisticated administrative routing policies to be implemented. It does not exchange information about network topology but
rather reachability information. As such, BGP is better suited to inter-AS environments and special cases like informational feeds. If you just need to enable
dynamic routing in your network, consider OSPF instead.

## BGP Terminology
```
AS - Autonomous System
ASN - Autonomous System Number
NLRI - Network Layer Reachability Information is what is being exchanged between BGP peers and represents how to reach the prefixes.
IGP - Interior Gateway Protocol
```
```
The feature is not supported on SMIPS devices (hAP lite, hAP lite TC, and hAP mini).
```
```
EGP - Exterior Gateway protocol
RR - Route reflector is the router in the BGP network that reflects advertisements to all the neighbors, avoiding the requirement for full BGP
mesh.
Route server - is the BGP router that does not participate in traffic forwarding. Routes are typically not even installed in the FIB.
loopback address - a /32 address configured on a dummy bridge interface, that can act as a loopback.
```
BGP Basics
BGP routers exchange reachability information by means of a transport protocol, which in the case of BGP is TCP (port 179). Upon forming a TCP
connection these routers exchange OPEN messages to negotiate and confirm supported capabilities.
After agreeing on capabilities to use, the session is considered to be established and peers can start to exchange NLRIs via UPDATE messages. This
information contains an indication of what sequence of full paths (BGP AS numbers) the route should take in order to reach the destination network (NLRI
prefix).
The peers initially exchange their full routing tables and after the initial exchange, incremental updates are sent as the routing tables change. Thus, BGP
does not require a periodic refresh of the entire BGP routing table.
BGP maintains the routing table version number which must be the same between any two given peers for the duration of the connection.
KEEPALIVE messages are sent periodically to ensure that the connection is up and running, if KEEPALIVE messages are not received within the Hold
Time interval, the connection will be closed.
To respond to errors or special conditions, NOTIFICATION messages can be generated and sent to the remote peer, notification message type also
indicates whether the connection should be immediately closed.
There can be two types of BGP connections:
```
iBGP - is an "internal" link connecting peers from the same AS
eBGP - is an "external" link connecting peers belonging to two different AS-es
```
A particular AS might have multiple BGP speakers and provide transit service to other AS-es. This implies that BGP speakers must maintain a consistent
view of routing within the AS.  A consistent view of the routes exterior to the AS is provided by having all BGP routers within the AS establish direct iBGP
connections with each other (full mesh) or by utilizing a Router Reflector setup.
Using a set of administrative policies BGP speakers within the AS come to an agreement as to which entry/exit point to use for a particular destination.
This information is communicated to the interior routers of the AS using the interior routing protocol (IGP), for example, OSPF, RIP, or static routing. In
certain setups, iBGP can take the IGP protocol role as well.
For certain BGP attributes handling behavior may change depending on what type of connection is set up, for example, the LOCAL-PREF attribute is not
advertised to eBGP peers.
RouterOS divides configuration and session monitoring into three menus:
```
connection menu (/routing/bgp/connection)
sessions menu(/routing/bgp/session)
template menu (/routing/bgp/template)
```
Connection Menu
Let's look at a very basic eBGP configuration example assuming, that Router1 IP is 192.168.1.1, AS 65531 and Router2 IP 192.168.1.2, AS 65532:
```
#Router1
/routing/bgp/connection
add name=toR2 remote.address=192.168.1.2 as=65531 local.role=ebgp
```
```
#Router2
/routing/bgp/connection
add name=toR1 remote.address=192.168.1.1 as=65532 local.role=ebgp
```
The BGP connection menu defines BGP outgoing connections as well as acts as a template matcher for incoming BGP connections.
local.role parameter is used to indicate that this connection will be the eBGP. Also, notice that the connection does not require a remote AS number
to be specified, RouterOS can determine a remote AS number dynamically from the first received OPEN message.
The parameter equivalent to other vendors and older RouterOS "update-source" is "local.address". In most cases, it can be left unconfigured, and let
the router determine the address.
When a local address is not specified, BGP will try to guess the local address depending on the current setup:
```
if the peer is iBGP
if loopback available
pick the highest loopback address
if loopback is not available
pick any highest IP address on the router
if the peer is eBGP
if a remote peer's IP is not from a directly connected network:
and multihop is not set, then throw an error
and multihop is enabled:
if loopback available
pick the highest loopback address
if loopback is not available
pick any highest IP address on the router
if a remote peer's IP is from a directly connected network:
and multihop is not set:
pick the local routers IP address from that connected network
and multihop is set:
if loopback available
pick the highest loopback address
if loopback is not available
pick any highest IP address on the router
```
In addition to connection-specific parameters, template-specific parameters are also directly exposed in this menu, for easier configuration in simple
scenarios (when templates are not necessary).
A list of all connection-specific parameters can be seen in the table below:
```
Property Description
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Name of the BGP connection
```
```
connect (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether to allow the router to initiate the connection.
```
```
listen (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether to listen for incoming connections.
```
```
local - a group of parameters associated with the local side of the connection
```
```
.address (IPv4/6; Default: ::) Local connection address.
```
```
.port(integer [0..65535]; Default:179 ) Local connection port.
```
```
.role(ebgp | ebgp-customer | ebgp-peer |
ebgp-provider | ebgp-rs | ebgp-rs-client | ibgp
| ibgp-rr; Default: )
```
```
BGP role, in most common scenarios it should be set to iBGP or eBGP. More information on BGP
roles can be found in the corresponding RFC draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-
open-policy/?include_text=1)
```
```
.ttl (integer [1..255]; Default:) Time To Live (hop limit) that will be recorded in sent TCP packets.
```
```
remote - a group of parameters associated with the remote side of the connection
```
```
.address (IPv4/6; Default: ::) Remote address used to connect and/or listen to.
```
```
.port(integer [0..65535]; Default:179 ) Local connection port.
```
```
.as(integer []; Default: ) Remote AS number. If not specified BGP will determine remote AS automatically from the OPEN
message.
```
```
.allowed-as() List of remote AS numbers that are allowed to connect. Useful for dynamic peer configuration.
```
```
.ttl (integer [1..255]; Default:) Acceptable minimum Time To Live, the hop limit for this TCP connection. For example, if 'ttl=255'
then only single-hop neighbors will be able to establish the connection. This property only affects
EBGP peers.
```
```
tcp-md5-key (string; Default: ) The key used to authenticate the connection with TCP MD5 signature as described in RFC 2385. If
not specified, authentication is not used.
```
```
templates (name[,name]; Default: default) List of the template names, to inherit parameters from. Useful for dynamic BGP peers.
```
Session Menu
To see the actual active sessions with selected template parameters and negotiated capabilities refer to the BGP sessions menu:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /routing/bgp/session> print
Flags: E - established
0 E name="toR2"
remote.address=192.168.1.2 .as=65532 .id=192.168.1.1 .refused-cap-opt=no
.capabilities=mp,rr,as4 .afi=ip,ipv6 .messages=43346 .bytes=3635916 .eor=""
local.address=192.168.1.1 .as=65531 .id=192.168.44.2 .capabilities=mp,rr,gr,as4 .messages=2
.bytes=71 .eor=""
output.procid=97 .keep-sent-attributes=no
.last-notification=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff0015030601
input.procid=97 .limit-process-routes=500000 ebgp limit-exceeded
hold-time=3m keepalive-time=1m uptime=4s70ms
```
This menu shows read-only cached BGP session information. It will show the current status of the session, flags, last received notification, and negotiated
session parameters.
Even if the BGP session is not active anymore, the cache can still be stored for some time. Routes received from a particular session are removed only if
the cache expires, this allows mitigating extensive routing table recalculations if the BGP session is flapping.
Also, in this menu is located a session-specific set of commands.
```
Command Description
```
```
clear Clear the session flags. For example, to be able to re-establish a session after the prefix limit is reached "limit-exceeded" flag must be
cleared. It can be done by specifying "flag" parameter, which is able to take the following values:
```
```
input-last-notification
limit-exceeded
output-last-notification
refused-cap-opt
stopped
```
```
dump-saved-
advertisements
```
```
Dump saved advertisements from specified BGP session in the *.pcap file. The filename to store data is set by "save-to" parameter.
```
```
refresh Send route refresh to a specified BGP session. Is used to trigger re-sending all the routes from the remote peer. "address-family"
parameters allow specifying for which address family to send route refresh.
```
```
resend Resend prefixes to a specified BGP session. The command takes two parameters:
```
```
"address-family" - parameters allow specifying for which address family to resend prefixes.
"save-to" - the name of the pcap file where to dump resent messages, can be used for debugging purposes.
```
```
reset Reset specified BGP session.
```
```
stop Stop specified BGP session.
```
Template Menu
The template contains all BGP protocol-related configuration options. It can be used as a template for dynamic peers and to apply a similar configuration to
a group of peers. Note that this is not the same as peer groups on Cisco devices, where the group is more than just a common configuration.
List of available template parameters:
```
Property Description
```
```
add-path-out (all
|none; Default: )
```
```
address-families (ip | ipv6 |
l2vpn | l2vpn-cisco | vpnv4;
Default: ip)
```
```
List of address families about which this peer will exchange routing information. The remote peer must support (they
usually do) BGP capabilities optional parameter to negotiate any other families than IP.
```
```
as (integer [0..4294967295];
Default: )
```
```
32-bit BGP autonomous system number. Value can be entered in AS-Plain and AS-Dot formats. The parameter is
also used to set up the BGP confederation, in the following format: confederation_as/as. For example, if your
AS is 34 and your confederation AS is 43, then as configuration should be as=43/34.
```
```
as-override (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
If set, then all instances of the remote peer's AS number in the BGP AS-PATH attribute are replaced with the local
AS number before sending a route update to that peer. Happens before routing filters and prepending.
```
```
cisco-vpls-nlri-len-fmt (auto-
bits | auto-bytes | bits | bytes;
Default: )
```
```
VPLS NLRI length format type. Used for compatibility with Cisco VPLS. [[Read more>>]].
```
```
cluster-id (IP address;
Default: )
```
```
In case this instance is a route reflector: the cluster ID of the router reflector cluster to this instance belongs. This
attribute helps to recognize routing updates that come from another route reflector in this cluster and avoid routing
information looping. Note that normally there is only one route reflector in a cluster; in this case, 'cluster-id' does not
need to be configured and BGP router ID is used instead
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no
)
```
```
Whether the template is disabled.
```
```
hold-time (time[3s..1h] |
infinity; Default: 3m)
```
```
Specifies the BGP Hold Time value to use when negotiating with peers.
According to the BGP specification, if the router does not receive successive KEEPALIVE and/or UPDATE and/or NO
TIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold Time field of the OPEN message, then the BGP
connection to the peer will be closed.
```
```
The minimal hold-time value of both peers will be used (note that the special value 0 or 'infinity' is lower than any
other value)
```
```
infinity - never expire the connection and never send keepalive messages.
```
```
input - a group of parameters associated with BGP input
```
```
.accept-comunities (string
; Default: )
```
```
A quick way to filter incoming updates with specific communities. It allows filtering incoming messages directly before
they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory usage. Regular input filter chain
can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing route table as "not
active, filtered". Changes to be applied required session refresh.
```
```
.accept-ext-communities(
string; Default: )
```
```
A quick way to filter incoming updates with specific extended communities. It allows filtering incoming messages
directly before they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory usage. Regular
input filter chain can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing route
table as "not active, filtered". Changes to be applied required session refresh.
```
```
.accept-large-comunities
(string; Default: )
```
```
A quick way to filter incoming updates with specific large communities. It allows filtering incoming messages directly
before they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory usage. Regular input filter
chain can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing route table as "not
active, filtered". Changes to be applied required session refresh.
```
```
.accept-nlri(string;
Default: )
```
```
Name of the ipv4/6 address-list. A quick way to filter incoming updates with specific NLRIs. It allows filtering incoming
messages directly before they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory usage.
Regular input filter chain can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing
route table as "not active, filtered". Changes to be applied required session restart.
```
```
.accept-unknown(string;
Default: )
```
```
A quick way to filter incoming updates with specific "unknown" attributes. It allows filtering incoming messages
directly before they are even parsed and stored in memory, that way significantly reducing memory usage. Regular
input filter chain can only reject prefixes which means that it will still eat memory and will be visible in /routing route
table as "not active, filtered". Changes to be applied required session refresh.
```
```
.affinity(afi  | alone |
instance | main | remote-
as | vrf; Default: alone )
```
```
Configure input multi-core processing. Read more in Routing Protocol Multi-core Support article.
```
```
alone - input and output of each session are processed in its own process, most likely the best option when
there are a lot of cores and a lot of peers
afi, instance, vrf, remote-as - try to run input/output of new session in process with similar parameters
main - run input/output in the main process (could potentially increase performance on single-core even possibly
on multi-core devices with a small amount of cores)
input - run output in the same process as input (can be set only for output affinity)
```
```
.allow-as (integer [0..10];
Default: )
```
```
Indicates how many times to allow your own AS number in AS-PATH, before discarding a prefix.
```
```
.filter (name; Default: ) Name of the routing filter chain to be used on input prefixes. This happens after NLRIs are processed. If the chain is
not specified, then BGP by default accepts everything.

```
```
Whether to ignore the AS_PATH attribute in the BGP route selection algorithm
```
```
.limit-nlri-diversity (integer
; Default: )
```
```
.limit-process-routes-
ipv4 (integer; Default: )
```
```
Try to limit the amount of received IPv4 routes to the specified number. This number does not represent the exact
number of routes going to be installed in the routing table by the peer. BGP session "clear" command must be used
to reset the flag if the limit is reached.
```
```
.limit-process-routes-
ipv6 (integer; Default: )
```
```
Try to limit the amount of received IPv6 routes to the specified number. This number does not represent the exact
number of routes going to be installed in the routing table by the peer. BGP session "clear" command must be used
to reset the flag if the limit is reached.
```
keepalive-time (time [1s..
30m]; Default: )
```
The interval between keepalive messages, if not set by default keepalive is 1/3 of the hold-time.
```
multihop (yes | no; Default: no
)
```
Specifies whether the remote peer is more than one hop away.
This option affects outgoing next-hop selection as described in RFC 4271 (for EBGP only, excluding EBGP peers
local to the confederation).
```
```
It also affects:
```
```
whether to accept connections from peers that are not in the same network (the remote address of the
connection is used for this check);
whether to accept incoming routes with NEXT_HOP attribute that is not in the same network as the address
used to establish the connection;
the target-scope of the routes installed from this peer; routes from multi-hop or IBGP peers resolve their next-
hops through IGP routes by default.
```
name (string; Default: ) Name of the BGP template
nexthop-choice (default |
force-self | propagate;
Default: default)
```
Affects the outgoing NEXT_HOP attribute selection. Note that next-hops set in filters always take precedence. Also
note that the next-hop is not changed on route reflection, except when it's set in the filter.
```
```
default - select the next-hop as described in RFC 4271
force-self - always use a local address of the interface that is used to connect to the peer as the next-hop;
propagate - try to propagate further the next-hop received; i.e. if the route has BGP NEXT_HOP attribute, then
use it as the next-hop, otherwise, fall back to the default case
```
output - a group of parameters associated with BGP output
```
.affinity(afi  | alone |

```
default-prepend (integer
[0..255]; Default: )
```
```
.filter-chain (name;
Default: )
```
```
Name of the routing filter chain to be used on the output prefixes. If the chain is not specified, then BGP by default
accepts everything.
```
```
.filter-select (name;
Default: )
```
```
Name of the routing select chain to be used for prefix selection. If not specified, then default selection is used.
```
```
.keep-sent-attributes (ye
s | no; Default: no)
```
```
Store in memory sent prefix attributes, required for "dump-saved-advertisements" command to work. By default,
sent-out prefixes are not stored to preserve the router's memory. An option should be enabled only for debugging
purposes when necessary to see currently advertised prefixes.
```
```
.network(name; Default:
)
```
```
Name of the address list used to send local networks. The network is sent only if a matching IGP route exists in the
routing table.

reflection (yes | no;
Default: )
```
```
Disable client-to-client route reflection in Route Reflector setups.
```
```
.no-early-cut (yes | no;
Default: )
```
```
The early cut is the mechanism, to guess (based on default RFC behavior) what would happen with the sent NPLRI
when received by the remote peer. If the algorithm determines that the NLRI is going to be dropped, a peer will not
even try to send it. However such behavior may not be desired in specific scenarios, then then this option should be
used to disable the early cut feature.

modem, ospf, rip, static,
vpn; Default:)
```
```
Enable redistribution of specified route types.
```
remove-private-as (yes | no;
Default: no
```
If set, then the BGP AS-PATH attribute is removed before sending out route updates if the attribute contains only
private AS numbers.
```
```
The removal process happens before routing filters are applied and before the local, AS number is prepended to the
AS path.
```
router-id (IP | name; Default:
main )
```
BGP Router ID to be used. Use the ID from the /routing/router-id configuration by specifying the reference name, or
set the ID directly by specifying IP.
```
```
Equal router-ids are also used to group peers into one instance.

routing-table (string; Default:
)
```
Name of the routing table, to install routes in.
```
save-to (string; Default: ) Filename to be used to save BGP protocol-specific packet content (Exported PDU) into pcap file. This method allows
much simpler peer-specific packet capturing for debugging purposes. Pcap files in this format can also be loaded to
create virtual BGP peers to recreate conditions that happened at the time when packet capture was running.
templates (name[,name];
Default: )
```
List of template names from which to inherit parameters. Useful feature, to easily configure groups with overlapping
configuration options.
```
use-bfd (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to use the BFD protocol for faster connection state detection.
vrf (name; Default: main ) Name of the VRF BGP connections operates on. By default always use the "main" routing table.

Best-Path Selection
BGP routers can receive multiple copies of the global routing table from multiple providers.
There should be some way to compare those multiple BGP routing tables and select the best route to the destination, the solution is the BGP Best Path
Selection Algorithm.
The route is evaluated by the algorithm only if it is valid. In general, the route is considered valid if:
```
NEXT_HOP of the route is valid and reachable
AS_PATH received from external peers does not contain the local AS
the route is not rejected by routing filters
```
For more information read nexthop selection and validation.
The best path algorithm also compares routes received only by a single BGP instance. Routes installed by different BGP instances are compared by the
general algorithm, i.e. route distances are compared and the route with a lower distance is preferred.
If all the criteria are met, then the following actions take place:
```
The first path received is automatically considered the 'best path'. Any further received paths are compared to the first received to determine if the
new path is better.
Prefer the path with the highest WEIGHT.
This parameter is not a part of the BGP standard, it is invented to quickly locally select the best route. A parameter is local to the router (assigned
with routing filters in the BGP input) and cannot be advertised. A route without assigned WEIGHT has a default value of 0.
Prefer the path with the highest LOCAL_PREF.
This attribute is used only within an AS. A path without the LOCAL_PREF attribute has a value of 100 by default.
Prefer the path with the shortest AS_PATH. (skipped if input.ignore-as-path-len set to yes).
Each AS_SET counts as 1, regardless of the set size. The AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and AS_CONFED_SET are not included in the AS_PATH
length.
Prefer the path that was locally originated via aggregate or BGP network
Prefer the path with the lowest ORIGIN type.
```
```
Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is lower than Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), and EGP is lower than INCOMPLETE
```
```
in other words IGP < EGP < INCOMPLETE
Prefer the path with the lowest multi-exit discriminator (MED).
```
```
The router compares the MED attribute only for paths that have the same neighboring (leftmost) AS unless input.always-compare-med is
enabled.
Paths without explicit MED value are treated with MED of 0.
Prefer eBGP over iBGP paths
Prefer lowest IGP metric.
Prefer the route that comes from the BGP router with the lowest router ID. If a route carries the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, then the ORIGINATOR
_ID is used instead of the router ID.
Prefer the route with the shortest route reflection cluster list. Routes without a cluster list are considered to have a cluster list of length 0.
Prefer the path that comes from the lowest neighbor address
```
Routing Filter Notes
On BGP output routing filters are executed before BGP itself is modifying attributes, for example, if nexthop-choice is set to force-self, then the
gateway set in the routing filters will be overridden.
On BGP input routing filters are applied to the received attributes, which means that, for example, setting the gateway will work no matter what nexhop-
choice value is set.
Running More than One Instance
As we already know for best path selection to work properly, BGP routes must be received from the same instance. But in certain scenarios it is necessary
to run multiple BGP instances with their own separate tables.
BGP determines whether sessions belongs to the same instance by comparing configured local router IDs.
For example config below will run each peer in its own BGP instance
```

# RPKI

## Overview
RouterOS implements the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol defined in RFC8210. RTR is a very lightweight low memory
footprint protocol, to reliably get prefix validation data from RPKI validators.
More information on RPKI and how to set up validators can be found in the RIPE blog:
https://blog.apnic.net/2019/10/28/how-to-installing-an-rpki-validator/

## Basic Example
Let's consider that we have our own RTR server on our network with IP address 192.168.1.1:
```
/routing/bgp/rpki
add group=myRpkiGroup address=192.168.1.1 port=8282 refresh-interval=20
```
If the connection is established and a database from the validator is received, we can check prefix validity:
```
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /routing> rpki-check group=myRpkiGroup prfx=70.132.18.0/24 origin-as=16509
valid
```
Now the cached database can be used by routing filters to accept/reject prefixes based on RPKI validity. At first, we need to set up a filter rule which
defines against which RPKI group performs the verification. After that filters are ready to match the status from the RPKI database. Status can have one of
three values:
```
valid - database has a record and origin AS is valid.
invalid - the database has a record and origin AS is invalid.
unknown - database does not have information of prefix and origin AS.
unverified - set when none of the RPKI sessions of the RPKI group has synced database. This value can be used to handle the total failure of the
RPKI.
```
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=bgp_in rule="rpki-verify myRpkiGroup"
add chain=bgp_in rule="if (rpki invalid) { reject } else { accept }"
```

## Configuration Options
Sub-Menu: /routing/rpki
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IPv4/6) mandatory Address of the RTR server
```
```
disabled(yes | no; Default: no) Whether the item is ignored.
```
```
expire-interval (integer [600..172800];
Default: 7200)
```
```
Time interval [s] polled data is considered valid in the absence of a valid subsequent update from the
validator.
```
```
group (string) mandatory Name of the group a database is assigned to.
```
```
port (integer [0..65535]; Default: 323) Connection port number
```
preference (integer [0..4294967295];
Default: 0)
```
If there are multiple RTR sources, the preference number indicates a more preferred one. A higher
number is preferred.
```
```
If preference is not configured then lowest remote IP within a group is preferred, if IPs are equal then
lowest remote port is preferred.
```
refresh-interval (integer [1..86400];
Default: 3600)
```
Time interval [s] to poll the newest data from the validator.
```
retry-interval (integer [1..7200]; Default:
600)
```
Time Interval [s] to retry after the failed data poll from the validator.
```
vrf(name; Default: main) Name of the VRF table used to bind the connection to.


# Route Selection and Filters

## Route Filtering

## Filter Syntax
The routing filter rule implements script-like syntax. The example below is a quick demonstration of a routing filter that matches prefixes with a prefix length
greater than 24 from subnet 192.168.1.0/24 and increments the default distance by 1. If there is no match then subtract the default distance by one.
```
/routing filter rule
add chain=myChain \
rule="if (dst in 192.168.1.0/24 && dst-len>24) {set distance +1; accept} else {set distance -1; accept}"
```
Filter rule may consist of multiple matchers and actions:
```
if ( [matchers] ) { [actions] } else { [actions] }
```
There are two types of properties:
```
only readable - ones that value is only readable and cannot be rewritten, these properties can be used only by matchers
readable/writable - ones that value is readable and writeable, used by filter actions, and also can be used by matchers
```
Readable properties can be matched by other readable properties (for numeric properties only) or constant values using boolean operators.
```
[matchers]:
[prop readable] [bool operator] [prop readable]
```
```
[actions]:
[action] [prop writeable] [value]
```
The boolean operator is not used if there is only one possible operation.
Example without boolean operator:
```
if ( protocol connected ) { accept }
```
Example with boolean operator:
```
if ( bgp-med < 30 ) { accept }
```
With readable flag properties, matcher is used without specified boolean operator and without value
```
if ( ospf-dn ) { reject }
```

peer-
prepend
```
Prepend last received remote peers ASN. If the prefix is originated from the router, then this parameter will not do
anything on the router's output, because ASN does not exist yet.
```
```
If used as a matcher in BGP input, it is possible to filter prefixes exceeding a certain number of prepends. For
example, if a remote peer prepends its ASN 5 times, but we want to allow max 4 times prepended ASN, then we can
use: "if (bgp-path-peer-prepend > 4) {reject}"
```
```
This parameter also overrides any prepends received from the remote peer, for example, if the remote peer
prepended it's AS 3 times, we can remove this prepend by setting "bgp-path-peer-prepend 1" in BGP input
```
bgp-path-

Deleting BGP Communities
Routing filters allow to clear BGP communities by using "delete" command. Delete command accepts several parameters based on the type of the
community type:
```
communities:
"wk" - will match and remove well known communities
"other" - will match and remove other communities that are not well known
"regexp" - regexp pattern to match communities that should be deleted
"<community-list name>" - deletes communities from specified community-list
ext-communities:
"rt" - will match and remove RouteTarget
"soo" - will match and remove Site-of-Origin
"other" - will match and remove other ext communities that are not RT or SSO
"regexp" - regexp pattern to match ext communities that should be deleted
"<community-ext-list name>" - deletes communities from specified community-ext-list
large-communities:
"all" - removes everything
"regexp" - regexp pattern to match large communities that should be deleted
"<community-large-list name>" - deletes large communities from specified community-large-list
```
It is possible to specify multiple community types, for example delete all SSOs, other type of ext communities and specific RTs from the community-ext list:
```
/routing/filter/community-ext-list
add list=myRTList communities="rt:1.1.1.1:222"
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="delete bgp-ext-communities sso,other,myRTList;"
```
AS-PATH Regexp Matching
AS Path is the sequence of autonomous system numbers (ASNs), for example AS Path 123 456 789 would indicate, that route originated from AS with the
number 789, and to reach the destination, the packet would need to travel through two autonomous systems: 456 and 789. To apply specific routing
policies administrator might want to match specific AS numbers or set of numbers in the AS Path (for example, reject prefixes that travel through AS 456),
which can be achieved using regular expression (regexp).
There are two common ways how to operate with AS Path data:
```
convert whole AS path to string and let regexp operate on the string (ROS v6 or Cisco style)
let regexp operate on each entry in the AS path as a number (ROS v7, Juniper style)
```
Basically, the first method is performing the match per character, the second method is performing the match per whole AS number. As you would imagine
the latter method is much faster and less resource-intensive than the string matching approach.
This change would require administrators to implement new Regex strategies. Old Regex patterns from RouterOS v6 cannot be directly copied/pasted as
they will result either in syntax errors or unexpected results.
Let us take a very basic AS Path filter rule.
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="if (bgp-as-path .1234.) {accept}"
```
In ROS v7 this Regex pattern will match ASN 1234 anywhere in the middle of the AS-path, the same pattern in ROS v6 would match any AS path that
contains ASN consisting of at least 6 characters and contains a string of "1234".  Obviously, if we directly copy/paste the Regex pattern from one
implementation to another it will lead to unexpected/dangerous results. An equivalent pattern in ROS v6 would look something like this: "._1234_.".
Let's take another example from ROS v6, say we have a pattern "1234[5-9]" what it does is it matches 12345 to 12349 anywhere in the string, which
means that valid matches are AS-path "12345 3434", "11 9123467 22" and so on. If you enter the same pattern in ROS v7 it will match AS path containing
exact ASN 1234 followed by ASN in a range from 5 to 9 (matching AS-paths would be "1234 7 111", "111 1234 5 222" etc., it will not match "12345 3434").
```
Do not copy Regex patterns directly from ROS v6 or Cisco configurations, they are not directly compatible. It can lead to unexpected or even
dangerous configurations in some scenarios.
```
Regex Testing Tool
RouterOS now has a built-in regex checking tool to simplify the hard life of the administrators. This tool supports also num-list so now exact regex can be
tested against any as-path before applying it to the routing filters.
```
/routing/filter/num-list add list=test range=100-1500
```
```
/routing/filter/test-as-path-regexp regexp="[[:test:]]5678\$" as-path="1234,5678"
```
Supported Operators

Community and Num Lists
A list of commonly used numbers can be configured from the /routing/filter/num-list menu. These lists of numbers can be used in the filter rules
to simplify the filter setup process.
In a similar manner, you are allowed to define also community, extended community, and large community lists. Community sets can be used for matching,
appending, and setting.
For example match communities from the list and clear the attribute:
```
/routing/filter/community-list
add communities=111:222 list=myCommunityList
```
```
/routing/filter/rule
add chain=myChain rule="if (bgp-communities equal-list myCommunityList) {delete bgp-communities wk,other;
accept;}"
```
/routing/filter/community-list
```
Property Description
```
```
comment (string; Default: )
```
```
Repetition ranges {} are not supported.
```
```
communities (list of communities;
Default: )
```
```
List of communities expressed either as well-known name or in the following format: "as:number", where each
section can be integer [0..65535].
```
```
Accepted well known names:
```
```
accept-own graceful-shutdown  no-advertise no-llgr route-filter-6
accept-own-nh  internet no-export  no-peer route-filter-xlate-4
blackhole  llgr-stale local-as  route-filter-4  route-filter-xlate-6

```
```
List of extended communities expressed as raw integer value or in the typed format: "type:value", where
type can be:
```
```
rt - route-target
soo -  site of origin
```
```

```
```
regexp (string) Regexp matcher to match communities. The community set with only the regexp parameter cannot be
used to append communities.
```
Route Selection
Route selection rules allow controlling how output routes are selected from available candidate routes. By default, (if no selection rules are set) output
always picks the best route.
For example, if we look at the routing table below, we can see that there are 2 candidate routes and one best route. By default when BGP selects which
route to send out, it will pick the active route.
```
[admin@4] /routing/route> print where dst-address=1.0.0.0/24
Flags: A - ACTIVE; b, y - COPY
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, AFI, DISTANCE, SCOPE, TARGET-SCOPE, IMMEDIATE-GW
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY AFI DISTANCE SCOPE TARGET-SCOPE IMMEDIATE-GW
b 1.0.0.0/24 10.155.101.217 ip4 19 40 30 10.155.109.254%ether1
Ab 1.0.0.0/24 10.155.101.232 ip4 20 40 30 10.155.109.254%ether1
b 1.0.0.0/24 10.155.101.231 ip4 20 40 30 10.155.109.254%ether1
```
But there might be cases where you would want preference for other routes, not the active ones, and here come in-play selection rules.
Selection rules in RouterOS are configured from /routing/filter/select-rule menu.
Select rules can also call routing filters where routes get selected based on filter rules. For example, to mimic default output selection we can set up the
following rule sets:
```
/routing filter rule
add chain=get_active rule="if (active) {accept}"
```
```
/routing filter select-rule
add chain=my_select_chain do-where=get_active
```

# Group Management Protocol
```
Introduction
Configuration options
Examples
```

## Introduction
The Group Management Protocol allows any of the interfaces to become a receiver for the multicast stream. It allows testing the multicast routing and
switching setups without using dedicated IGMP or MLD clients. The option is available since RouterOS v7.4 and it supports IGMP v1, v2, v3 and MLD v1,
v2 protocols.
Interfaces are using IGMP v3 and MLD v2 by default. In case IGMP v1, v2 or MLD v1 queries are received, the interfaces will fall back to the appropriate
version. Once Group Management Protocol is created on the interface, it will send an unsolicited membership report (join) packet and respond to query
messages. If the configuration is removed or disabled, the interface will send a leave message.

## Configuration options
This section describes the Group Management Protocol configuration options.
Sub-menu: /routing gmp
```
Property Description
```
```
groups (IPv4 | IPv6
; Default: )
```
```
The multicast group address to be used by the interface, multiple group addresses are supported.
```
```
interfaces (name;
Default: )
```
```
Name of the interface, multiple interfaces and interface lists are supported.
```
```
exclude (Default: ) When exclude is set, the interface expects to reject multicast data from the configured sources. When this option is not used,
the interfaces will emit source specific join for the configured sources.
```
```
sources (IPv4 |
IPv6; Default: )
```
```
The source address list used by the interface, multiple source addresses are supported. This setting has an effect when IGMPv3
or MLDv2 protocols are active.
```

## Examples
This example shows how to configure a simple multicast listener on the interface.
First, add an IP address on the interface:
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.10/24 interface=ether1 network=192.168.10.0
```
Then configure Group Management Protocol on the same interface:
```
/routing gmp
add groups=229.1.1.1 interfaces=ether1
```
It is now possible to check your multicast network to see if routers or switches have created the appropriate multicast forwarding entries and whether
multicast data is being received on the interface (see the interface stats, or use a Packet Sniffer and Torch).


# IGMP Proxy
```
Summary
Configuration options
Examples
```

## Summary
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) proxy can implement multicast routing. It is forwarding IGMP frames and is commonly used when there is no
need for a more advanced protocol like PIM.
IGMP proxy features:
```
The simplest way how to do multicast routing;
Can be used in topologies where PIM-SM is not suitable for some reason;
It takes slightly less resources than PIM-SM;
Ease of configuration.
```
On the other hand, IGMP proxy is not well suited for complicated multicast routing setups. Compared to PIM-based solutions, IGMP proxy does not
support more than one upstream interface and routing loops are not detected or avoided.
By default, IGMP proxy upstream interface will send IGMPv3 membership reports and it will detect what IGMP version the upstream device (e.g. multicast
router) is using based on received queries. In case IGMPv1/v2 queries are received, the upstream port will fall back to the lower IGMP version. It will
convert back to IGMPv3 when IGMPv1/v2 querier present timer (400s) expires. Downstream interfaces of IGMP proxy will only send IGMPv2 queries.

## Configuration options
General IGMP proxy configuration.
Sub-menu: /routing igmp-proxy
```
Property Description
```
```
query-interval (time: 1s
..1h; Default: 2m5s)
```
```
How often to send out IGMP Query messages over downstream interfaces.
```
```
query-response-
interval (time: 1s..1h;
Default: 10s)
```
```
How long to wait for responses to an IGMP Query message.
```
```
quick-leave Specifies action on IGMP Leave message. If quick-leave is on, then an IGMP Leave message is sent upstream as soon as a
leave message is received from the first client on the downstream interface. Use yes only in case there is only one subscriber
behind the proxy.
```
Configure what interfaces will participate as IGMP proxy interfaces on the router. If an interface is not configured as an IGMP proxy interface, then all
IGMP traffic received on it will be ignored.
Sub-menu: /routing igmp-proxy interface
```
Property Description
```
```
alternative-
subnets (IP/Mask;
Default: )
```
```
By default, only packets from directly attached subnets are accepted. This parameter can be used to specify a list of alternative
valid packet source subnets, both for data or IGMP packets. Has an effect only on the upstream interface. Should be used when the
source of multicast data often is in a different IP network.
```
```
RouterOS v7 has IGMP proxy configuration available in the main system package. Older RouterOS versions need an additional multicast
package installed in order to use IGMP proxy. See more details about Packages.
```
```
interface (name;
Default: all)
```
```
Name of the interface.
```
```
threshold (intege
r: 0..4294967295;
Default: 1 )
```
```
Minimal TTL. Packets received with a lower TTL value are ignored
```
```
upstream (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
The interface is called "upstream" if it's in the direction of the root of the multicast tree. An IGMP forwarding router must have
exactly one upstream interface configured. The upstream interface is used to send out IGMP membership requests.
```
It is possible to get detailed status information for each interface using the print status command.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /routing igmp-proxy interface print status

```
wrong-packets (read-only:
integer)
```
```
The total amount of received multicast packets that arrived on a wrong interface, for example, a multicast stream that is
received on a downstream interface instead of an upstream interface.
```
RouterOS support static multicast forwarding rules for IGMP proxy. If a static rule is added, all dynamic rules for that group will be ignored. These rules will
take effect only if IGMP-proxy interfaces are configured (upstream and downstream interfaces should be set) or these rules won't be active.
```
Property Description
```
```
downstream-interfaces (name; Default: ) The received stream will be sent out to the listed interfaces only.
```
```
group (read-only: IP address) The multicast group address this rule applies.
```
```
source (read-only: IP address) The multicast data originator address.
```
```
upstream-interface (read-only: name) The interface that is receiving stream data.
```
Examples
To forward all multicast data coming from the ether2 interface to the downstream bridge interface, where subscribers are connected, use the configuration
below. Both interfaces should have an IP address.
```
/routing igmp-proxy interface
add interface=ether2 upstream=yes
add interface=bridge1
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /routing igmp-proxy interface print
Flags: U - UPSTREAM
Columns: INTERFACE, THRESHOLD
# INTERFACE THRESHOLD
0 U ether2 1
1 bridge1 1
```
You may also need to configure alternative-subnets on the upstream interface in case the multicast sender address is in an IP subnet that is not
directly reachable from the local router:
```
/routing igmp-proxy interface
set [find upstream=yes] alternative-subnets=192.168.50.0/24,192.168.60.0/24
```
To enable quick-leave, use the setting below:
```
/routing igmp-proxy
set quick-leave=yes
```

## Summary
IP Multicast is a technology that allows data to be efficiently shared with many recipients over the Internet. Senders transmit their data to a specific
multicast IP address, and receivers indicate their interest in receiving data sent to that address. The network then takes care of delivering the data from
senders to receivers.
If both the sender and receiver for a multicast group are on the same local network segment, routers are not required for the process. Communication can
happen directly, and this can be enhanced with the use of IGMP snooping switches. However, if the sender and receiver are on different network
segments, a multicast routing protocol must be used to establish the path for data transmission between them.
Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM or PIM) enables RouterOS to support multicast streaming over the network area. PIM stands for
Platform Independent Multicast, meaning it's not tied to any particular unicast routing. SM stands for Sparse-Mode, which means that specific control
messages ensure that data is delivered only to network segments where there are receivers that want it. In addition to the routing protocols that manage
data transmission between network segments, routers need a way to discover local receivers on their directly connected network segment. For IPv4, this is
achieved through the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6.

## Basic multicast routing on single device
Picture this scenario, you have got a router with two interfaces, namely ether1 and ether2, and each of them is set up in separate networks. Normally, the
router will create connected routes and hosts on both networks will be able to communicate using unicast traffic. However, if you want to enable multicast
communication between these networks, you'll need to configure multicast routing separately because it won't work otherwise. In this scenario, we are
going to create a simple configuration. This involves creating a PIM instance and configuring the required interfaces.
```
RouterOS v7 has PIM-SM configuration available in the main system package. Older RouterOS versions need an additional multicast package
installed in order to use PIM-SM. See more details about Packages.
```
```
The feature is not supported on SMIPS devices (hAP lite, hAP lite TC and hAP mini).
```
Begin by ensuring that IP addresses are set up on the router's interfaces.
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=ether1 network=192.168.10.0
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=ether2 network=192.168.20.0
```
Configure PIM instance. For this example, the default settings should work fine.
```
/routing pimsm instance
add name=pimsm-instance-1
```
Last, add interfaces and specify the PIM instance you created earlier.
```
/routing pimsm interface-template
add interfaces=ether1,ether2 instance=pimsm-instance-1
```
Now router starts listening to IGMP membership reports (client join messages) and will route multicast traffic to clients interested in receiving it.
To test the configuration, you can configure a multicast sender using RouterOS traffic-generator and IGMP client using GMP.
```
# Multicast Sender
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.10/24 interface=ether1 network=192.168.10.0
/tool traffic-generator packet-template
add interface=ether1 ip-dst=229.1.1.2 mac-dst=01:00:5E:01:01:02/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF name=multicast
/tool traffic-generator quick tx-template=multicast mbps=10
```
```
# Multicast Client
/ip address
add address=192.168.20.10/24 interface=ether1 network=192.168.20.0
/routing gmp
add disabled=no groups=229.1.1.2 interfaces=ether1
```
To verify whether multicast traffic is being properly routed, monitor the received packet counters on the client interface or use tools like Torch or a Packet
Sniffer.
It is also possible to monitor active multicast group on router:
```
/routing pimsm uib-g print
Columns: INSTANCE, GROUP
# INSTANCE GROUP
0 pimsm-instance-1 229.1.1.2
```
```
/routing pimsm uib-sg print
Flags: K - KEEPALIVE; S - SPT-BIT
Columns: INSTANCE, GROUP, SOURCE
# INSTANCE GROUP SOURCE
0 KS pimsm-instance-1 229.1.1.2 192.168.10.10
```
Multicast routing with static RP
In the upcoming example, we'll be working with multiple PIM routers, as shown in the diagram below. PIM-SM uses shared trees and to make this work, we
need to designate a specific node as the multicast root distribution point. In PIM, this router is called the Rendezvous Point, or RP. There are various
methods for selecting an RP in PIM, such as the Bootstrap Router (BSR) method. However, for this example, we'll be using a straightforward approach
known as static RP configuration. This means that the administrator can manually specify one or more RPs for specific multicast groups.
To get started, we'll need to configure IP addresses and set up unicast routing. In this example, we'll use OSPF to exchange routing information between
the routers. See more details about OSFP.
```
# R1 Rendezvous Point:
/interface bridge
add name=loopback
/ip address
add address=10.0.0.1 interface=loopback network=10.0.0.1
add address=10.0.1.1/24 interface=ether2 network=10.0.1.0
add address=10.0.2.1/24 interface=ether3 network=10.0.2.0
/routing ospf instance

```
```
# R2:
/interface bridge
add name=loopback
/ip address
add address=10.0.0.2 interface=loopback network=10.0.0.2
add address=10.0.1.2/24 interface=ether1 network=10.0.1.0
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=ether12 network=192.168.20.0
/routing ospf instance
add disabled=no name=ospf-instance-1 router-id=10.0.0.2
/routing ospf area
add disabled=no instance=ospf-instance-1 name=ospf-area-1

```
```
# R3:
/interface bridge
add name=loopback
/ip address
add address=10.0.0.3 interface=loopback network=10.0.0.3
add address=10.0.2.3/24 interface=ether1 network=10.0.2.0
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=ether12 network=192.168.30.0
/routing ospf instance
add disabled=no name=ospf-instance-1 router-id=10.0.0.3
/routing ospf area
add disabled=no instance=ospf-instance-1 name=ospf-area-1
/routing ospf interface-template
add area=ospf-area-1 disabled=no interfaces=loopback,ether1,ether12
```
As in the previous example with a single router, we need to configure the PIM instance and add the necessary interfaces on all routers.
```
# R1 Rendezvous Point:
/routing pimsm instance
add disabled=no name=pimsm-instance-1
/routing pimsm interface-template
add instance=pimsm-instance-1 interfaces=loopback,ether2,ether3
```
```
# R2:
/routing pimsm instance
add disabled=no name=pimsm-instance-1
/routing pimsm interface-template
add instance=pimsm-instance-1 interfaces=loopback,ether1,ether12
```
```
# R3:
/routing pimsm instance
add name=pimsm-instance-1
/routing pimsm interface-template
add instance=pimsm-instance-1 interfaces=loopback,ether1,ether12
```
Now, let's take a look at our PIM neighbors and their current statuses. On R1, there are two neighbors, while on R2 and R3, there's only one neighbor
each.
```
# R1 Rendezvous Point:
/routing pimsm neighbor print
Flags: R - DESIGNATED-ROUTER; J - JOIN-TRACKING
Columns: INSTANCE, ADDRESS, PRIORITY
# INSTANCE ADDRESS PRIORITY
0 RJ pimsm-instance-1 10.0.1.2%ether2 1
1 RJ pimsm-instance-1 10.0.2.3%ether3 1
```
```
# R2:
/routing pimsm neighbor print
Flags: R - DESIGNATED-ROUTER; J - JOIN-TRACKING
Columns: INSTANCE, ADDRESS, PRIORITY
# INSTANCE ADDRESS PRIORITY
0 J pimsm-instance-1 10.0.1.1%ether1 1
```
```
# R3:
/routing pimsm neighbor print
Flags: J - JOIN-TRACKING
Columns: INSTANCE, ADDRESS, PRIORITY
# INSTANCE ADDRESS PRIORITY
0 J pimsm-instance-1 10.0.2.1%ether1 1
```
Finally, we will select one router to act as our Rendezvous Point (RP). We will configure the R1 loopback IP address on all PIM routers. It's important to
ensure that each router has the correct routing information to reach the R1 loopback address.
```
# R1 Rendezvous Point:
/routing pimsm static-rp
add address=10.0.0.1 instance=pimsm-instance-1
```
```
# R2:
/routing pimsm static-rp
add address=10.0.0.1 instance=pimsm-instance-1
```
```
# R3:
/routing pimsm static-rp
add address=10.0.0.1 instance=pimsm-instance-1
```

Sets the value of a Tracking (T) bit in the LAN Prune Delay option in the Hello message. When enabled, a router advertises its willingness
to disable Join suppression. it is possible for upstream routers to explicitly track the join membership of individual downstream routers if
Join suppression is disabled. Unless all PIM routers on a link negotiate this capability, explicit tracking and the disabling of the Join
suppression mechanism are not possible.
```

can have an (S,G) state and still be forwarding on a (*,G) state during the interval when the source-specific tree is being constructed. When
SPT bit is false, only the (*,G) forwarding state is used to forward packets from S to G. When SPT bit is true, both (*,G) and (S,G)
forwarding states are used.

# /routing/fantasy
Fantasy menu is a fancy way to generate large amount of routes for testing purposes. Main benefits of this approach compared to script is the generation
speed and simplicity. It is easy to remove all fantasy generated routes just by disabling fantasy rule.
Fantasy uses random generator from hashed route sequence number, seed and other parameters.

# Routing Reference


# /routing/id
Global Router ID election configuration. ID can be configured explicitly or set to be elected from one of the Routers IP addresses.
For each VRF table RouterOS adds dynamic ID instance, that elects the ID from one of the IP addresses belonging to a particular VRF:
```
[admin@rack1_b33_CCR1036] /routing/id> print
Flags: D - DYNAMIC, I - INACTIVE

# BFD

## Summary
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a low-overhead and short-duration protocol intended to detect faults in the bidirectional path between two
forwarding engines, including physical interfaces, sub-interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible the forwarding engines themselves, with potentially
very low latency. It operates independently of media, data protocols, and routing protocols.
BFD is basically a hello protocol for checking bidirectional neighbor reachability. It provides sub-second link failure detection support. BFD is not routing
protocol specific, unlike protocol hello timers or such.
BFD Control packets are transmitted in UDP packets with destination port 3784, BFD also uses port 4784 for multihop paths. The source port is in the
range 49152 through 65535. And BFD Echo packets are encapsulated in UDP packets with destination port 3785.
Standards and Technologies:
```
RFC 5880 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
RFC 5881 BFD for IPv4 and IPv6
RFC 5882 Generic Application of BFD
RFC 5883 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multihop Paths
```

## Features not yet supported
```
echo mode
enabling BFD for ip route gateways
authentication
```

## Configuration
Allowing or forbidding BFD sessions can be done from the /routing bfd configuration menu. For example:
```
/routing bfd configuration
add interfaces=sfp12 forbid-bfd=yes
add interfaces=static
```
Configuration entries are order sensitive, which means that in the example above we are forbidding BFD sessions explicitly on the "sfp12" interface and
allowing on the rest of the interfaces belonging to the "static" interface list.
To be able to filter multi-hop sessions, addresses or address-list properties can be used to match the destination, as well as the appropriate VRF, if
a session is not running in the "main" VRF.
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=10.155.255.183 list=bgp_allow_bfd
add address=10.155.255.217 list=bgp_allow_bfd
```
```
/routing bfd configuration
add addresses=111.111.0.0/16 vrf=vrf1
add address-list=bgp_allow_bfd
```
Everything else that is not explicitly listed in the configuration by default is forbidden.
BFD with BGP
To enable the use of BFD for BGP sessions, enable use-bfd for required entries in /routing bgp connection menu.
A useful feature is that the BGP session will show that the BFD session for that particular BGP session is down:
```
[admin@dr_02_BGP_MUM] /routing/bgp/session> print
Flags: E - established
0 E ;;; BFD session down
name="ovpn_test1-1"
remote.address=111.111.11.11@vrf1 .as=65530 .id=10.155.101.217
.capabilities=mp,rr,as4 .hold-time=infinity .messages=40717
.bytes=3436281 .eor=""
local.address=111.111.11.12@vrf1 .as=555 .id=111.111.11.12
.capabilities=mp,rr,gr,as4 .messages=1 .bytes=19 .eor=""
output.procid=20
input.procid=20 .filter=bgp-in ebgp
hold-time=infinity use-bfd=yes uptime=3s210ms
last-started=2023-05-19 09:54:04 prefix-count=3853
```
BFD with OSPF
To enable the use of BFD for OSPF neighbors, enable use-bfd for required entries in /routing ospf interface-template menu.
Session Status
The status of the currently available sessions can be observed from /routing bfd session menu:
```
[admin@dr_02_BGP_MUM] /routing/bfd/session> print
Flags: U - up, I - inactive
0 I ;;; BFD forbidden for destination address
multihop=yes remote-address=10.155.101.183 local-address="" desired-tx-interval=0ms required-min-rx=0ms
multiplier=0
```
```
1 multihop=no remote-address=111.111.11.11%ovpn-out1@vrf1 local-address=111.111.11.12@vrf1 state=down
state-changes=0 desired-tx-interval=200ms required-min-rx=200ms remote-min-rx=1us multiplier=5
packets-rx=0 packets-tx=7674
```
BFD is picking the highest value between the local tx interval and remote minimum rx interval as desired transmit interval. If the session is not established
then desired minimum tx interval is set to 1 second.

Overview
IS-IS Terminology
Basic Configuration Example
```

## Overview
The IS-IS (Intermediate System - Intermediate System) protocol is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used to distribute IP routing information throughout a
single Autonomous System.
It was originally developed as a routing protocol for CLNP but later extended to include IP routing when IP became popular.  An extended version is
sometimes referred to as Integrated IS-IS.
IS-IS belongs to the link-state protocol family, which exchanges topology information between nearest neighbors and floods it throughout the AS. The main
advantage is that complete knowledge of the network topology allows one to choose the best path to the destination. It can also be useful for traffic
engineering purposes.
Neighbours periodically exchange Hello packets, forms adjacency and selects designated IS based on the negotiation. Hello packets are sent individually
for Level-1 and Level-2.
Standards and Technologies:
```
RFC 1195 Use of OSI IS-IS for Routing in TCP/IP and Dual Environments
RFC 5302 Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution with Two-Level IS-IS
RFC 5303 Three-Way Handshake for IS-IS Point-to-Point Adjacencies
RFC 5305 IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering (only wide metric support)
RFC 5308 Routing IPv6 with IS-IS
```

## IS-IS Terminology
```
IS - Intermediate System is a router capable of forwarding traffic between distantly located hosts.
LSP - Link State PDU contains information on the router's local state (usable interfaces, reachable neighbours, and the cost of the interfaces)
SPF - Shortest-path-first algorithm
DIS - designated intermediate system. DIS ensures that all routes in the network maintain synchronised database. Separate DISs are elected for
L1 and L2 routing. Election of the DIS is based on the highest interface priority.
Level-1 (L1) routing - Controls distribution of routing information within an IS-IS area. L1 routing is based on system ID.
Level-2 (L2) routing - Controls distribution of routing information between IS-IS areas. L2 routing is based on area ID.
IS-IS Adjacency - link between IS-IS neighbours. The type of adjacency formed depends on the parameters exchanged in the IS-IS Hello packets.
Each of the the adjacent routers runs the DIS election process to determine whether it is eligible to be an L1 or L2 DIS on the broadcast network.
```

## Scripting language manual
This manual provides an introduction to RouterOS's built-in powerful scripting language.
Scripting host provides a way to automate some router maintenance tasks by means of executing user-defined scripts bounded to some event occurrence.
Scripts can be stored in the Script repository or can be written directly to the console. The events used to trigger script execution include, but are not
limited to the System Scheduler, the Traffic Monitoring Tool, and the Netwatch Tool generated events.
If you are already familiar with scripting in RouterOS, you might want to see our Tips & Tricks.

## Line structure
The RouterOS script is divided into a number of command lines. Command lines are executed one by one until the end of the script or until a runtime error
occurs.
Command-line
The RouterOS console uses the following command syntax:
[prefix] [path] command [uparam] [param=[value]] .. [param=[value]]
```
[prefix] - ":" or "/" character which indicates if a command is ICE or path. It may not be required.
[path] - relative path to the desired menu level. It may not be required.
command - one of the commands available at the specified menu level.
[uparam] - unnamed parameter, must be specified if the command requires it.
[params] - a sequence of named parameters followed by respective values
```
The end of the command line is represented by the token “;” or NEWLINE. Sometimes “;” or NEWLINE is not required to end the command line.
Single command inside (), [] or {} does not require any end-of-command character. The end of the command is determined by the content of the
whole script
```
:if ( true ) do={ :put "lala" }
```
Each command line inside another command line starts and ends with square brackets "[ ]" (command concatenation).
```
:put [/ip route get [find gateway=1.1.1.1]];
```
Notice that the code above contains three command lines:
```
:put
/ip route get
find gateway=1.1.1.1
```
Command-line can be constructed from more than one physical line by following line joining rules.
Physical Line
A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line (EOL) sequence. Any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be
used:
```
Unix – ASCII LF;
Windows – ASCII CR LF;
mac – ASCII CR;
```
Standard C conventions for newline characters can be used ( the \n character).
Comments
The following rules apply to a comment:
```
A comment starts with a hash character (#) and ends at the end of the physical line.
RouterOS does not support multiline comments.
If a # character appears inside the string it is not considered a comment.
```
Example
```
# this is a comment
# next line comment
:global a; # another valid comment
```
```
:global myStr "part of the string # is not a comment"
```
Line joining
Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using the backslash character (\).
The following rules apply to using backslash as a line-joining tool:
```
A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment.
A backslash does not continue a comment.
A backslash does not continue a token except for string literals.
A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a line outside a string literal.
```
Example
```
:if ($a = true \
and $b=false) do={ :put "$a $b"; }
:if ($a = true \ # bad comment
and $b=false) do={ :put "$a $b"; }
# comment \
continued - invalid (syntax error)
```
Whitespace between tokens
Whitespace can be used to separate tokens. Whitespace is necessary between two tokens only if their concatenation could be interpreted as a different
token. Example:

### {
```
:local a true; :local b false;
# whitespace is not required
:put (a&&b);
# whitespace is required
:put (a and b);
}
```
Whitespace characters are not allowed
```
between '<parameter>='
between 'from=' 'to=' 'step=' 'in=' 'do=' 'else='
```
Example:
```
#incorrect:
:for i from = 1 to = 2 do = { :put $i }
#correct syntax:
:for i from=1 to=2 do={ :put $i }
:for i from= 1 to= 2 do={ :put $i }
```
```
#incorrect
/ip route add gateway = 3.3.3.3
#correct
/ip route add gateway=3.3.3.3
```
Scopes
Variables can be used only in certain regions of the script called scopes. These regions determine the visibility of the variable. There are two types of
scopes - global and local. A variable declared within a block is accessible only within that block and blocks enclosed by it, and only after the point of
declaration.
Global scope
Global scope or root scope is the default scope of the script. It is created automatically and can not be turned off.
Local scope
User can define their own groups to block access to certain variables, these scopes are called local scopes. Each local scope is enclosed in curly braces
("{ }").

### {
```
:local a 3;
{
:local b 4;
:put ($a+$b);
} #line below will show variable b in light red color since it is not defined in scope
:put ($a+$b);
}
```
In the code above variable, b has local scope and will not be accessible after a closing curly brace.
So for example, the defined local variable will not be visible in the next command line and will generate a syntax error
```
[admin@MikroTik] > :local myVar a;
[admin@MikroTik] > :put $myVar
syntax error (line 1 column 7)
```
Note that even variable can be defined as global, it will be available only from its scope unless it is not referenced to be visible outside of the scope.

### {
```
:local a 3;
{
:global b 4;
}
:put ($a+$b);
}
```
The code above will output 3, because outside of the scope b is not visible.
The following code will fix the problem and will output 7:

### {
```
:local a 3;
{
:global b 4;
}
:global b;
:put ($a+$b);
}
```
Keywords
The following words are keywords and cannot be used as variable and function names:
```
and or in
```
Delimiters
The following tokens serve as delimiters in the grammar:
```
() [] {} : ; $ /
```
Data types
RouterOS scripting language has the following data types:
```
Each line written in the terminal is treated as local scope
```
```
Do not define global variables inside local scopes.
```
```
Type Description
```
```
num (number) - 64bit signed integer, possible hexadecimal input;
```
```
bool (boolean) - values can bee true or false;
```
```
str (string) - character sequence;
```
```
ip - IP address;
```
```
ip-prefix - IP prefix;
```
```
ip6 - IPv6 address
```
```
ip6-prefix - IPv6 prefix
```
```
id (internal ID) - hexadecimal value prefixed by '*' sign. Each menu item has an assigned unique number - internal ID;
```
```
time - date and time value;
```
```
array - sequence of values organized in an array;
```
```
nil - default variable type if no value is assigned;
```
Constant Escape Sequences
Following escape sequences can be used to define certain special characters within a string:
```
\" Insert double quote
```
```
\\ Insert backslash
```
```
\n Insert newline
```
```
\r Insert carriage return
```
```
\t Insert horizontal tab
```
```
\$ Output $ character. Otherwise, $ is used to link the variable.
```
```
\? Output? character. Otherwise? is used to print "help" in the console. Removed since v7.1rc2
```
```
\_ - space
```
```
\a - BEL (0x07)
```
```
\b - backspace (0x08)
```
```
\f - form feed (0xFF)
```
```
\v Insert vertical tab
```
```
\xx A print character from hex value. Hex numbers should use capital letters.
```
Example
```
:put "\48\45\4C\4C\4F\r\nThis\r\nis\r\na\r\ntest";
```
which will show on the display
HELLO
This
is
a
test
Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Usual arithmetic operators are supported in the RouterOS scripting language
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
"+" binary addition :put (3+4);
```
```
"-" binary subtraction :put (1-6);
```
```
"*" binary multiplication :put (4*5);
```
```
"/" binary division :put (10 / 2); :put ((10)/2)
```
```
"%" modulo operation :put (5 % 3);
```
```
"-" unary negation { :local a 1; :put (-a); }
```
Note: for the division to work you have to use braces or spaces around the dividend so it is not mistaken as an IP address
Relational Operators
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
"<" less :put (3<4);
```
```
">" greater :put (3>4);
```
```
"=" equal :put (2=2);
```
```
"<=" less or equal
```
```
">=" greater or equal
```
```
"!=" not equal
```
To negate an expression, you can use "expression=false". To print all interfaces that are not "ethernet", you can use expression negation like this:
```
/interface/print where (name~"ether")=false
```
Or to do the opposite, you can use "expression=true":
```
/interface/print where (name~"ether")=true
```
Logical Operators
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
“!” logical NOT :put (!true);
```
```
“&&”, “and” logical AND :put (true&&true)
```
```
“||”, “or” logical OR :put (true||false);
```
```
“in” :put (1.1.1.1/32 in 1.0.0.0/8);
```
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are working on number, IP, and IPv6 address data types.
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
“~” bit inversion :put (~0.0.0.0)
:put (~::ffff)
```
```
“|” bitwise OR. Performs logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. In each pair the result is
“1” if one of the bits or both bits is “1”, otherwise the result is “0”.
```
```
:put (192.168.88.0|0.
0.0.255)
:put (2001::1|::ffff)
```
```
“^” bitwise XOR. The same as OR, but the result in each position is “1” if two bits are not equal, and “0” if the
bits are equal.
```
```
:put (1.1.1.1^255.
255.0.0)
:put (2001::ffff:1^::
ffff:0)
```
```
“&” bitwise AND. In each pair, the result is “1” if the first and second bit is “1”. Otherwise, the result is “0”. :put (192.168.88.77
&255.255.255.0)
:put (2001::
1111&ffff::)
```
```
“<<” left shift by a given amount of bits, not supported for IPv6 address data type :put (192.168.88.77
<<8)
```
```
“>>” right shift by a given amount of bits, not supported for IPv6 address data type :put (192.168.88.77
>>24)
```
Calculate the subnet address from the given IP and CIDR Netmask using the "&" operator:

### {
```
:local IP 192.168.88.77;
:local CIDRnetmask 255.255.255.0;
:put ($IP&$CIDRnetmask);
}
```
Get the last 8 bits from the given IP addresses:
```
:put (192.168.88.77&0.0.0.255);
```
Use the "|" operator and inverted CIDR mask to calculate the broadcast address:

### {
```
:local IP 192.168.88.77;
:local Network 192.168.88.0;
:local CIDRnetmask 255.255.255.0;
:local InvertedCIDR (~$CIDRnetmask);
:put ($Network|$InvertedCIDR)
}
```
Concatenation Operators
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
"." concatenates two strings :put ("concatenate". " ". "string");
```
```
"," concatenates two arrays or adds an element to the array :put ({1;2;3} , 5 );
```
It is possible to add variable values to strings without a concatenation operator:
```
:global myVar "world";
```
```
:put ("Hello ". $myVar);
# next line does the same as above
:put "Hello $myVar";
```
By using $[] and $() in the string it is possible to add expressions inside strings:
```
:local a 5;
:local b 6;
:put " 5x6 = $($a * $b)";
```
```
:put " We have $[ :len [/ip route find] ] routes";
```
Other Operators
```
Operator Description Example
```
```
“[]” command substitution. Can contain only a single command line :put [ :len "my test string"; ];
```
```
“()” subexpression or grouping operator :put ( "value is ". (4+5));
```
```
“$” substitution operator :global a 5; :put $a;
```
```
“~” the binary operator that matches value against POSIX extended regular
expression
```
```
Print all routes whose gateway ends with 202:
/ip route print where gateway~"^[0-9 \\.]
*202\$"
```
```
“->” Get an array element by key [admin@x86] >:global aaa {a=1;b=2}
[admin@x86] > :put ($aaa->"a")
1
[admin@x86] > :put ($aaa->"b")
2
```
Variables
The scripting language has two types of variables:
```
global - accessible from all scripts created by the current user, defined by global keyword;
local - accessible only within the current scope, defined by local keyword.
```
There can be undefined variables. When a variable is undefined, the parser will try to look for variables set, for example, by DHCP lease-script or Hotspot o
n-login
Every variable, except for built-in RouterOS variables, must be declared before usage by local or global keywords. Undefined variables will be marked as
undefined and will result in a compilation error. Example:
```
# following code will result in compilation error, because myVar is used without declaration
:set myVar "my value";
:put $myVar
```
Correct code:
```
:local myVar;
:set myVar "my value";
:put $myVar;
```
The exception is when using variables set, for example, by DHCP lease-script
```
/system script
add name=myLeaseScript policy=\
ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,winbox,password,sniff,sensitive,api \
source=":log info \$leaseActIP\r\
\n:log info \$leaseActMAC\r\
\n:log info \$leaseServerName\r\
\n:log info \$leaseBound"
```
```
/ip dhcp-server set myServer lease-script=myLeaseScript
```
Valid characters in variable names are letters and digits. If the variable name contains any other character, then the variable name should be put in double
quotes. Example:
```
#valid variable name
:local myVar;
#invalid variable name
:local my-var;
#valid because double quoted
:global "my-var";
```
If a variable is initially defined without value then the variable data type is set to nil, otherwise, a data type is determined automatically by the scripting
engine. Sometimes conversion from one data type to another is required. It can be achieved using data conversion commands. Example:
```
#convert string to array
:local myStr "1,2,3,4,5";
:put [:typeof $myStr];
:local myArr [:toarray $myStr];
:put [:typeof $myArr]
```
Variable names are case-sensitive.
```
:local myVar "hello"
# following line will generate error, because variable myVAr is not defined
:put $myVAr
# correct code
:put $myVar
```
Set command without value will un-define the variable (remove from environment, new in v6.2)
```
#remove variable from environment
:global myVar "myValue"
:set myVar;
```
Use quotes on the full variable name when the name of the variable contains operators. Example:
```
:local "my-Var";
:set "my-Var" "my value";
:put $"my-Var";
```
Reserved variable names
All built-in RouterOS properties are reserved variables. Variables that will be defined the same as the RouterOS built-in properties can cause errors. To
avoid such errors, use custom designations.
For example, the following script will not work:

### {
```
:local type "ether1";
/interface print where name=$type;
}
```
But will work with different defined variables:

### {
```
:local customname "ether1";
/interface print where name=$customname;
}
```
Commands
Global commands
Every global command should start with the ":" token, otherwise, it will be treated as a variable.
```
Command Syntax Description Example
```
```
/ go to the root menu
```
```

convert :convert from=
[arg] to=[arg]
```
```
Converts specified value from one format to another. By
default uses an automatically parsed value, if the "from"
format is not specified (for example, "001" becomes "1",
"10.1" becomes "10.0.0.1", etc.).
```
```
from specifies the format of the value - base32, base64, bit-
array-lsb, bit-array-msb, byte-array, hex, num, raw, url.
```
```
to specifies the format of the output value - base32, base64,
hex, raw, rot13, url, num.
```
```
transform to transform values - lc (transforms value to be in
lowercases), uc (uppercases), lcfirst (first value to
lowercase), ucfirst (first value to uppercase)
```
```
:put [:convert 001 to=hex ]
```
```

```
print initialized variable information :global myVar true; :environment print;
```
```
error :error <output> Generate console error and stop executing the script
```
```
execute :execute
<expression>
```
```
Execute the script in the background. The result can be
written in the file by setting a "file" parameter or printed to the
CLI by setting "as-string".
```
```
When using the "as-string" parameter executed script is
blocked (not executed in the background).
```
```
Executed script can not be larger than 64kB
```

write a message to the system log. Available topics are "deb
ug, error, info and warning"
```
```
:log info "Hello from script";
```
onerror :onerror
<var_name> in=
{<command>} do=
{<expression>}
```
The command used to catch errors and get error details. The
do={...} block is executed, when in={...} block has an
error,  and error details are written in <var_name> variable.
```
```
Parameter order is important. The "error" parameter must be
set before "do" block, otherwise do block will not see the
local variable.
```
```
:onerror will return false (if there is no error) and true (if there
is an error) unless otherwise specified (with commands such
as :return or :error), so it can be used in :if condition
statement scripts.
```
```
:onerror errorName in={ :error "failure" }
do={ :put "Critical $errorName" }
```
parse :parse
<expression>
```
parse the string and return parsed console commands. Can
be used as a function.
```
```
:global myFunc [:parse ":put hello!"];
$myFunc;
```
pick :pick <var>
<start> [<end>]
```
return range of elements or substring. If the count is not
specified, will return only one element from an array.
```
```
var - value to pick elements from
start - element to start picking from (the first element
index is 0)
end - terminating index (element at this index is not
included)
```
```

name (returned results will not be cached);
server-port - server port;
type - any/any6/ipv4/ipv6:
any - first tries to resolve ipv4, if fails tries ipv6;
any6 - first tries to resolve ipv6, if fails tries ipv4;
ipv4 - tries to resolve only ipv4;

Menu specific commands
Common commands
The following commands are available from most sub-menus:
```
Command Syntax Description
```
```
add add
<param>=<value>.
.<param>=<value>
```
```
add new item
```
```
remove remove <id> remove selected item
```
```
enable enable <id> enable selected item
```
```
disable disable <id> disable selected item
```
```
set set <id>
<param>=<value>.
.<param>=<value>
```
```
change selected items parameter, more than one parameter can be specified at the time. The parameter can
be unset by specifying '!' before the parameter.
```
```
Example:
/ip firewall filter add chain=blah action=accept protocol=tcp port=123 nth=4,2
print
set 0 !port chain=blah2 !nth protocol=udp
```
```
get get <id>
<param>=<value>
```
```
get the selected item's parameter value
```
```
print print
<param><param>=
[<value>]
```
```
print menu items. Output depends on the print parameters specified. The most common print parameters are
described here
```
```
export export
[file=<value>]
```
```
export configuration from the current menu and its sub-menus (if present). If the file parameter is specified
output will be written to the file with the extension '.rsc', otherwise the output will be printed to the console.
Exported commands can be imported by import command
```
```
edit edit <id>
<param>
```
```
edit selected items property in the built-in text editor
```
```
find find
<expression>
```
```
Returns list of internal numbers for items that are matched by given expression. For example: :put [
/interface find name~"ether"]
```
import
The import command is available from the root menu and is used to import configuration from files created by an export command or written manually by
hand.
Starting from 7.16.x version, its possible to catch syntax errors:
```
[admin@admin] > do { import test.rsc } on-error={ :put "Failure" }
Failure
```
New parameter onerror can be used:
```
[admin@admin] > onerror e in={ import test.rsc } do={ :put "Failure - $e" }
Failure - Script Error: bad command name this (line 1 column 1)
```
In addition, the import command has new options in verbose mode - the dry-run parameter is specially designed for debugging and can find multiple errors
without changing the configuration.
```
[admin@admin] > import test.rsc verbose=yes dry-run
#line 1
this
bad command name this (line 1 column 1)
...
Script Error: found 5 error(s) in import file
```
print parameters
Several parameters are available for print command:
```
Parameter Description Example
```
```
append
```
```
as-value print output as an array of parameters and its values :put [/ip address print as-
value]
```
```
brief print brief description
```
```
detail print detailed description, the output is not as readable as brief output but may be useful
to view all parameters
```
```
count-only print only count of menu items
```
```
file print output to a file
```
```
follow print all current entries and track new entries until ctrl-c is pressed, very useful when
viewing log entries
```
```
/log print follow
```
```
follow-only print and track only new entries until ctrl-c is pressed, very useful when viewing log entries /log print follow-only
```
```
from print parameters only from specified item /user print from=admin
```
```
interval continuously print output in a selected time interval, useful to track down changes where f
ollow is not acceptable
```
```
/interface print interval=2
```
```
terse show details in a compact and machine-friendly format
```
```
value-list show values single per line (good for parsing purposes)
```
```
without-
paging
```
```
If the output does not fit in the console screen then do not stop, print all information in one
piece
```
```
where expressions followed by where parameters can be used to filter outmatched entries /ip route print where
interface="ether1"
```
```
about returns entries that have the "about" parameter, such as "managed by CAPsMAN
"information or warnings
```
```
/interface wifi print where
about
```
More than one parameter can be specified at a time, for example, /ip route print count-only interval=1 where interface="ether1"
Loops and conditional statements
Loops
```
Command Syntax Description
```
```
do..while :do { <commands> } while=( <conditions> ); :while ( <conditions> )
do={ <commands> };
```
```
execute commands until a given
condition is met.
```
```
for :for <var> from=<int> to=<int> step=<int> do={ <commands> } execute commands over a given number
of iterations
```
```
foreach :foreach <var> in=<array> do={ <commands> }; execute commands for each element in
a list
```
Conditional statement
```
Command Syntax Description
```
```
if :if (<condition>) do={<commands>} else=
{<commands>} <expression>
```
```
If a given condition is true then execute commands in the do block, otherwise
execute commands in the else block if specified.
```
Example:

### {
```
:local myBool true;
:if ($myBool = false) do={ :put "value is false" } else={ :put "value is true" }
}
```
Functions
Scripting language does not allow you to create functions directly, however, you could use :parse command as a workaround.
Starting from v6.2 new syntax is added to easier define such functions and even pass parameters. It is also possible to return function value with :return co
mmand.
See examples below:
```
#define function and run it
:global myFunc do={:put "hello from function"}
$myFunc
```
```
output:
hello from function
```
```
#pass arguments to the function
:global myFunc do={:put "arg a=$a"; :put "arg '1'=$1"}
$myFunc a="this is arg a value" "this is arg1 value"
```
```
output:
arg a=this is arg a value
arg '1'=this is arg1 value
```
Notice that there are two ways how to pass arguments:
```
pass arg with a specific name ("a" in our example)
pass value without arg name, in such case arg "1", "2" .. "n" is used.
```
Return example
```
:global myFunc do={ :return ($a + $b)}
:put [$myFunc a=6 b=2]
```
```
output:
8
```
You can even clone an existing script from the script environment and use it as a function.
```
#add script
/system script add name=myScript source=":put \"Hello $myVar !\""
```
```
:global myFunc [:parse [/system script get myScript source]]
$myFunc myVar=world
```
```
output:
Hello world!
```
For example:
```
:global my2 "123"
```
```
:global myFunc do={ :global my2; :put $my2; :set my2 "lala"; :put $my2 }
$myFunc my2=1234
:put "global value $my2"
```
The output will be:
```
1234
lala
global value 123
```
Nested function example
Note: to call another function its name needs to be declared (the same as for variables)
```
:global funcA do={ :return 5 }
:global funcB do={
:global funcA;
:return ([$funcA] + 4)
}
:put [$funcB]
```
```
Output:
9
```
Catch run-time errors
Starting from v6.2 scripting has the ability to catch run-time errors.
For example, the [code]:reslove[/code] command if failed will throw an error and break the script.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > { :put [:resolve http://www.example.com]; :put "lala";}
failure: dns name does not exist
```
Now we want to catch this error and proceed with our script:
```
If the function contains a defined global variable that names match the name of the passed parameter, then the globally defined variable is
ignored, for compatibility with scripts written for older versions. This feature can change in future versions. Avoid using parameters with the
same name as global variables.
```
```
:onerror e {:put [:resolve http://www.example.com]} do={:put "resolver failed"}
:put "lalala"
```
```
output:
```
```
resolver failed
lala
```
Operations with Arrays
Warning: Key name in the array contains any character other than a lowercase character, it should be put in quotes
For example:
```
[admin@ce0] > {:local a { "aX"=1; ay=2 }; :put ($a->"aX")}
1
```
Loop through keys and values
"foreach" command can be used to loop through keys and elements:
```
[admin@ce0] > :foreach k,v in={2; "aX"=1; y=2; 5} do={:put ("$k=$v")}
```
```
0=2
1=5
aX=1
y=2
```
If the "foreach" command is used with one argument, then the element value will be returned:
```
[admin@ce0] > :foreach v in={2; "aX"=1; y=2; 5} do={:put ("$v")}
```
```
2
5
1
2
```
Note: If the array element has a key then these elements are sorted in alphabetical order, elements without keys are moved before elements with keys and
their order is not changed (see example above).
Change the value of a single array element
```
[admin@MikroTik] > :global a {x=1; y=2}
[admin@MikroTik] > :set ($a->"x") 5
[admin@MikroTik] > :environment print
a={x=5; y=2}
```

# Scripting examples
```
Introduction
Create a file
Check if IP on the interface has changed
Strip netmask
Resolve host-name
Write simple queue stats in multiple files
Generate backup and send it by e-mail
Check bandwidth and add limitations
Block access to specific websites
Parse file to add ppp secrets
Detect new log entry
Allow use of ntp.org pool service for NTP
Other scripts
```

## Introduction
This section contains some useful scripts and shows all available scripting features. Script examples used in this section were tested with the latest 3.x
version.

## Create a file
it is not possible to create a file directly, however, there is a workaround:
```
/file print file=myFile
/file set myFile.txt contents=""
```

## Check if IP on the interface has changed
Sometimes provider gives dynamic IP addresses. This script will compare if a dynamic IP address is changed.
```
:global currentIP;
```
```
:local newIP [/ip address get [find interface="ether1"] address];
```
```
:if ($newIP != $currentIP) do={
:put "ip address $currentIP changed to $newIP";
:set currentIP $newIP;
}
```

## Strip netmask
This script is useful if you need an IP address without a netmask (for example to use it in a firewall), but "/ip address get [id] address" returns the
IP address and netmask.
```
:global ipaddress 10.1.101.1/24
```
```
:for i from=( [:len $ipaddress] - 1) to=0 do={
:if ( [:pick $ipaddress $i] = "/") do={
:put [:pick $ipaddress 0 $i]
}
}
```
Another much more simple way:
```
:global ipaddress 10.1.101.1/24
:put [:pick $ipaddress 0 [:find $ipaddress "/"]]
```
Resolve host-name
Many users are asking features to use DNS names instead of IP addresses for radius servers, firewall rules, etc.
So here is an example of how to resolve the RADIUS server's IP.
Let's say we have the radius server configured:
```
/radius
add address=3.4.5.6 comment=myRad
```
And here is a script that will resolve the IP address, compare resolved IP with configured one, and replace it if not equal:
```
/system script add name="resolver" source= {
```
```
:local resolvedIP [:resolve "server.example.com"];
:local radiusID [/radius find comment="myRad"];
:local currentIP [/radius get $radiusID address];
```
```
:if ($resolvedIP != $currentIP) do={
/radius set $radiusID address=$resolvedIP;
/log info "radius ip updated";
}
```
```
}
```
Add this script to the scheduler to run for example every 5 minutes
```
/system scheduler add name=resolveRadiusIP on-event="resolver" interval=5m
```
Write simple queue stats in multiple files
Let's consider queue namings are "some text.1" so we can search queues by the last number right after the dot.
```
:local entriesPerFile 10;
:local currentQueue 0;
:local queuesInFile 0;
:local fileContent "";
#determine needed file count
:local numQueues [/queue simple print count-only] ;
:local fileCount ($numQueues / $entriesPerFile);
:if ( ($fileCount * $entriesPerFile) != $numQueues) do={
:set fileCount ($fileCount + 1);
}
```
```
#remove old files
/file remove [find name~"stats"];
```
```
:put "fileCount=$fileCount";
```
```
:for i from=1 to=$fileCount do={
#create file
/file print file="stats$i.txt";
#clear content
/file set [find name="stats$i.txt"] contents="";
```
```
:while ($queuesInFile < $entriesPerFile) do={
:if ($currentQueue < $numQueues) do={
:set currentQueue ($currentQueue +1);
:put $currentQueue ;
/queue simple
:local internalID [find name~"\\.$currentQueue\$"];
:put "internalID=$internalID";
:set fileContent ($fileContent. [get $internalID target-address]. \
" ". [get $internalID total-bytes]. "\r\n");
}
:set queuesInFile ($queuesInFile +1);
```
```
}
/file set "stats$i.txt" contents=$fileContent;
:set fileContent "";
:set queuesInFile 0;
```
```
}
```
Generate backup and send it by e-mail
This script generates a backup file and sends it to a specified e-mail address. The mail subject contains the router's name, current date, and time.
Note that the SMTP server must be configured before this script can be used. See /tool e-mail for configuration options.
```
/system backup save name=email_backup
/tool e-mail send file=email_backup.backup to="me@test.com" body="See attached file" \
subject="$[/system identity get name] $[/system clock get time] $[/system clock get date] Backup")
```
```
The backup file contains sensitive information like passwords. So to get access to generated backup files, the script or scheduler must have a
'sensitive' policy.
```


# Use string as a function
```
:global printA [:parse ":local A; :put \$A;" ];
$printA
```

## Check bandwidth and add limitations
This script checks if the download on an interface is more than 512kbps if true then the queue is added to limit the speed to 256kbps.
```
:foreach i in=[/interface find] do={
/interface monitor-traffic $i once do={
:if ($"received-bits-per-second" > 0 ) do={
:local tmpIP [/ip address get [/ip address find interface=$i] address] ;
# :log warning $tmpIP ;
:for j from=( [:len $tmpIP] - 1) to=0 do={
:if ( [:pick $tmpIP $j] = "/") do={
/queue simple add name=$i max-limit=256000/256000 dst-address=[:pick $tmpIP 0 $j] ;
}
}
}
}
}
```

## Block access to specific websites
This script is useful if you want to block certain websites but you don't want to use a web proxy.
This example looks at entries "Rapidshare" and "youtube" in the DNS cache and adds IPs to the address list named "restricted". Before you begin, you
must set up a router to catch all DNS requests:
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=redirect chain=dstnat comment=DNS dst-port=53 protocol=tcp to-ports=53
add action=redirect chain=dstnat dst-port=53 protocol=udp to-ports=53
```
and add firewall
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward dst-address-list=restricted action=drop
```
Now we can write a script and schedule it to run, let's say, every 30 seconds.
Script Code:
```
:foreach i in=[/ip dns cache find] do={
:local bNew "true";
:local cacheName [/ip dns cache all get $i name] ;
# :put $cacheName;
```
```
:if (([:find $cacheName "rapidshare"] >= 0) || ([:find $cacheName "youtube"] >= 0)) do={
```
```
:local tmpAddress [/ip dns cache get $i address] ;
# :put $tmpAddress;
```
```
# if address list is empty do not check
:if ( [/ip firewall address-list find list="restricted" ] = "") do={
:log info ("added entry: $[/ip dns cache get $i name] IP $tmpAddress");
/ip firewall address-list add address=$tmpAddress list=restricted comment=$cacheName;
} else={
:foreach j in=[/ip firewall address-list find list="restricted"] do={
:if ( [/ip firewall address-list get $j address] = $tmpAddress ) do={
:set bNew "false";
}
}
:if ( $bNew = "true" ) do={
:log info ("added entry: $[/ip dns cache get $i name] IP $tmpAddress");
/ip firewall address-list add address=$tmpAddress list=restricted comment=$cacheName;
}
}
}
}
```
Parse file to add ppp secrets
This script requires that entries inside the file are in the following format:
username,password,local_address,remote_address,profile,service
For example:
```
janis,123,1.1.1.1,2.2.2.1,ppp_profile,myService
juris,456,1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,ppp_profile,myService
aija,678,1.1.1.1,2.2.2.3,ppp_profile,myService
```
```
:global content [/file get [/file find name=test.txt] contents] ;
:global contentLen [ :len $content ] ;
```
```
:global lineEnd 0;
:global line "";
:global lastEnd 0;
```
```
:do {
:set lineEnd [:find $content "\r\n" $lastEnd ] ;
:set line [:pick $content $lastEnd $lineEnd] ;
:set lastEnd ( $lineEnd + 2 ) ;
```
```
:local tmpArray [:toarray $line] ;
:if ( [:pick $tmpArray 0] != "" ) do={
:put $tmpArray;
/ppp secret add name=[:pick $tmpArray 0] password=[:pick $tmpArray 1] \
local-address=[:pick $tmpArray 2] remote-address=[:pick $tmpArray 3] \
profile=[:pick $tmpArray 4] service=[:pick $tmpArray 5];
}
} while ($lineEnd < $contentLen)
```
Detect new log entry
This script is checking if a new log entry is added to a particular buffer.
In this example we will use PPPoE logs:
```
/system logging action
add name="pppoe"
/system logging
add action=pppoe topics=pppoe,info,!ppp,!debug
```
Log buffer will look similar to this one:
```
[admin@mainGW] > /log print where buffer=pppoe
13:11:08 pppoe,info PPPoE connection established from 00:0C:42:04:4C:EE
```
Now we can write a script to detect if a new entry is added.
```
:global lastTime;
```
```
:global currentBuf [ :toarray [ /log find buffer=pppoe ] ] ;
:global currentLineCount [ :len $currentBuf ] ;
:global currentTime [ :totime [/log get [ :pick $currentBuf ($currentLineCount -1) ] time ] ];
```
```
:global message "";
```
```
:if ( $lastTime = "" ) do={
:set lastTime $currentTime ;
:set message [/log get [ :pick $currentBuf ($currentLineCount-1) ] message];
```
```
} else={
:if ( $lastTime < $currentTime ) do={
:set lastTime $currentTime ;
:set message [/log get [ :pick $currentBuf ($currentLineCount-1) ] message];
}
}
```
After a new entry is detected, it is saved in the "message" variable, which you can use later to parse log messages, for example, to get the PPPoE client's
mac addresses.
Allow use of ntp.org pool service for NTP
This script resolves the hostnames of two NTP servers, compares the result with the current NTP settings, and changes the addresses if they're different.
This script is required as RouterOS does not allow hostnames to be used in the NTP configuration. Two scripts are used. The first defines some system
variables which are used in other scripts and the second does the grunt work:
```
# System configuration script - "GlobalVars"
```
```
:put "Setting system globals";
```
```
# System name
:global SYSname [/system identity get name];
```
```
# E-mail address to send notifications to
:global SYSsendemail "mail@my.address";
```
```
# E-mail address to send notifications from
:global SYSmyemail "routeros@my.address";
```
```
# Mail server to use
:global SYSemailserver "1.2.3.4";
```
```
# NTP pools to use (check http://www.pool.ntp.org)
:global SYSntpa "0.uk.pool.ntp.org";
:global SYSntpb "1.uk.pool.ntp.org";
```
```
# Check and set NTP servers - "setntppool"
```
```
# We need to use the following globals which must be defined here even
# though they are also defined in the script we call to set them.
:global SYSname;
:global SYSsendemail;
:global SYSmyemail;
:global SYSmyname;
:global SYSemailserver;
:global SYSntpa;
:global SYSntpb;
```
```
# Load the global variables with the system defaults
/system script run GlobalVars
```
```
# Resolve the two ntp pool hostnames
:local ntpipa [:resolve $SYSntpa];
:local ntpipb [:resolve $SYSntpb];
```
```
# Get the current settings
:local ntpcura [/system ntp client get primary-ntp];
:local ntpcurb [/system ntp client get secondary-ntp];
```
```
# Define a variable so we know if anything's changed.
:local changea 0;
:local changeb 0;
```
```
# Debug output
:put ("Old: ". $ntpcura. " New: ". $ntpipa);
:put ("Old: ". $ntpcurb. " New: ". $ntpipb);
```
```
# Change primary if required
:if ($ntpipa != $ntpcura) do={
:put "Changing primary NTP";
/system ntp client set primary-ntp="$ntpipa";
:set changea 1;
}
```
```
# Change secondary if required
:if ($ntpipb != $ntpcurb) do={
:put "Changing secondary NTP";
/system ntp client set secondary-ntp="$ntpipb";
:set changeb 1;
}
```
```
# If we've made a change, send an e-mail to say so.
:if (($changea = 1) || ($changeb = 1)) do={
:put "Sending e-mail.";
/tool e-mail send \
to=$SYSsendemail \
subject=($SYSname. " NTP change") \
from=$SYSmyemail \
server=$SYSemailserver \
body=("Your NTP servers have just been changed:\n\nPrimary:\nOld: ". $ntpcura. "\nNew: " \
```
. $ntpipa. "\n\nSecondary\nOld: ". $ntpcurb. "\nNew: ". $ntpipb);
}
Scheduler entry:
```
/system scheduler add \
comment="Check and set NTP servers" \
disabled=no \
interval=12h \
name=CheckNTPServers \
on-event=setntppool \
policy=read,write,test \
start-date=jan/01/1970 \

```

## Do not use console numbers to get parameter values
Lets start with very basics. When you work with console to access parameters, you are used to following syntax:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /interface> print
Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, R - running, S - slave


# NAME TYPE ACTUAL-MTU L2MTU MAX-L2MTU
0 R ether1 ether 1500 1580 1022
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /interface> set 0 name=LAN
What print command does is temporary saves buffer with id numbers referencing to internal ID numbers, so obviously if you are trying to use non-existent
buffer values script will fail, like, for example this script:
/system script add name=script1 source={
/ip route set 0 gateway=3.3.3.3
}
Script does not know what you assume by "1" and will throw an error. Proper way is to use internal ID numbers, those numbers can be seen if you are
doing print as-value or returned by find command, for example:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /ip route> :put [find where dst-address="10.0.0.0/8"]
*1
So in this case proper script would be:
/system script add name=script1 source={
/ip route set *1 gateway=3.3.3.3
}
Note that it is not recommended to use internal numbers directly, since items can be removed and re-added in which case internal id number will change
and script will fail again, so instead use find command directly in your code:
/system script add name=script1 source={
/ip route set [find dst-address="0.0.0.0/0"] gateway=3.3.3.3
}

## Why find does not work even if correct value is specified?
Lets say we want to print specific address:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /ip address> print where address=111.111.1.1/24
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic


# ADDRESS NETWORK INTERFACE
So why it does not work?
Console tries to convert variable types as hard as it can, but it is not always possible to do it correctly, so lets look closely why this particular example does
not work. First lets check what variable type "address" is:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /ip address> :put [:typeof ([print as-value]->0->"address")]
str
So obviously we are comparing string to ip-prefix. And conversion from ip-prefix to string does not happen, so what we can do to solve the problem?
Convert variable to correct format:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /ip address> print where address=[:tostr 111.111.1.1/24]
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic


# ADDRESS NETWORK INTERFACE
0 111.111.1.1/24 111.111.1.0 ether2
Or use string directly:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] /ip address> print where address="111.111.1.1/24"
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic


# ADDRESS NETWORK INTERFACE
0 111.111.1.1/24 111.111.1.0 ether2
Obviously second method is not suitable if you are getting ip prefix from a variable, then conversion should be done as in first example or by writing
variable to string with "$myVar".
How to define empty array
RouterOS does not allow to define empty array in a way that you think it should work:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /interface> :global array {}
syntax error (line 1 column 17)
Insted a work around is to convert empty string to an array:
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] > :global array [:toarray ""]
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] > :environment print
array={}
From here we can use this array to set elements:
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] > :set ($array->"el0") "el0_val"
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] > :environment print
array={el0="el0_val"}
How to remove variables
You could use /system script environment remove to remove unused variables, however more preferred method is to unset variable.
Setting no value to existing parameter will unset it, see example below:
[admin@MikroTik] /system script environment> :global myVar 1
[admin@MikroTik] /system script environment> print


# NAME VALUE
0 myVar 1
[admin@MikroTik] /system script environment> :set myVar
[admin@MikroTik] /system script environment> print


# NAME VALUE
[admin@MikroTik] /system script environment>
Get values for properties if 'get' command is not available
For example, how do you get usable output for scripting from /interface wireless info hw-info command? Use as-value:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /interface wireless info> :put [hw-info wlan1 as-value ]
ranges=2312-2732/5/b;g;gn20;gn40;2484-2484/5/b;g;gn20;gn40;rx-chains=0;1;tx-chains=0;1
Output is 1D array so you can easily get interested property value
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /interface wireless info> :put ([hw-info wlan1 as-value ]->"tx-chains")
0;1
Always check what value and type command returns
Lets say we want to get gateway of specific route using as-value, if we execute following command it will return nothing
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] /ip address> :put ([/ip route print as-value where gateway="ether1"]->"gateway")
Command assumes that output will be 1D array from which we could extract element gateway.
At first lets check if print is actually find anything:
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] /ip address> :put ([/ip route print as-value where gateway="ether1"])
.id=*400ae12f;distance=255;dst-address=111.111.111.1/32;gateway=ether1;pref-src=111.111.111.1
So obviously there is something wrong with variable itself or variable type returned. Lets check it more closely:
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] /ip address> :global aa ([/ip route print as-value where gateway="ether1"
])
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] /ip address> :environment print
aa={{.id=*400ae12f; distance=255; dst-address=111.111.111.1/32; gateway={"ether1"}; pref-src=111.11
1.111.1}}
Now it is clear that returned value is 2D array with one element. So the right sequence to extract gateway will be:
```
get 2d array
get first element
get "gateway" from picked element
```
[admin@rack1_b36_CCR1009] /ip address> :put ([:pick [/ip route print as-value where gateway="ether1"] 0]->"
gateway")
ether1
Be careful when adding array to string
If you want to print an array or add an array to existing string, be very careful as it may lead to unexpected results. For example ,we have array with two
elements and we want to print the array value on screen:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :global array {"cccc", "ddddd"}
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :put ("array value is: ". $array )
array value is: cccc;array value is: ddddd
Obviously this is not what we expected, because what. does is adds string to each array element and then prints the output. Instead you need to convert
to string first:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :put ("array value is: ". [:tostr $array] )
array value is: cccc;ddddd
Get/Set unnamed elements in array
Lets say we have an array of elements { "el1"; "el2"; "el3" }. It is possible to pick elements of an array with pick command, but is not so neat as syntax
below:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :global test { "el1"; "el2"; "el3" }
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :put ($test->1)
el2
The same syntax can be used to set values:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :set ($test->2) "el3_changed"
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :environment print
test={"el1"; "el2"; "el3_changed"}
Set element value in 2D array
Syntax used in example above can also be used to set element value in 2D array:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /> :global test {{"11";"12";"13"};{"21";"22";"23"}}
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] > :set ($test->1->1) "22_changed"
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] > :put [($test->1->1)]
22_changed
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] > :environment print
test={{"11"; "12"; "13"}; {"21"; "22_changed"; "23"}}
Read value of global variable defined in other script
Lets say we have one script that declares variable and sets the value:
/system script add name=script1 source={
:global myVar "hello!"
}
And we want to write the value of that variable in log from another script. Simply adding /log info $myVar will fail to return correct value, because
second script does not know anything about variables defined in another scripts. To make it work properly variable need to be defined, so correct second
script code is:
/system script add name=script2 source={
:global myVar;
:log info "value is: $myvar"
}
Accessing global variable from function
Logically you would think that globally defined variables should be accessible in functions too, but that is not really the case. Lets see an example:
:global myVar "test"
:global myFunc do={
:put "global var=$myVar"
}
[$myFunc]
Output is:
global var=
So obviously global variable is not accessible directly. To make it work we need do declare global variable inside the function:
:global myVar "test"
:global myFunc do={
:global myVar;
:put "global var=$myVar"
}
[$myFunc]
Output:
global var=test
Running function from another function
Same as above applies also to functions. If you want to run function from another function then it need to be declared.
:global test do={
:return ($1 + 1)
}
:global testtest do={
:local x 5
:local y [$test $x]
:put "typeof = $[:typeof $y]"
:put "testets_res=$y"
}
Code above will not work as expected, output will be:
typeof = nil
testets_res=
To fix this we need to declare global "test" in "testtest" function
:global testtest do={
:global test
:local x 5
:local y [$test $x]
:put "typeof = $[:typeof $y]"
:put "testets_res=$y"
}
Always use unique variable names
One of the most common scripting mistakes that most users are doing is not using unique varible names, for example, variable defined in function has the
same name as globally defined variable, which leads to unexpected result:
:global my2 "123"
:global myFunc do={ :global my2; :put $my2; :set my2 "lala"; :put $my2 }
$myFunc my2=1234
:put "global value $my2"
Output will be:
1234
lala
global value 123
Another common case is when user defined variable have the same name as RouterOS built in variable, for example, we want to print route with dst
address defined in variable:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /ip route> :global "dst-address" "0.0.0.0/0"
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /ip route> print where dst-address=$"dst-address"
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic, C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,
B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit


# DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC GATEWAY DISTANCE
0 ADS 0.0.0.0/0 10.155.136.1 1
1 ADC 10.155.136.0/24 10.155.136.41 ether1 0
Obviously result is not as expected, simple solution, use unique variable name:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /ip route> :global myDst "0.0.0.0/0"
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /ip route> print where dst-address=$myDst
Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic, C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,
B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit


# DST-ADDRESS PREF-SRC GATEWAY DISTANCE
0 ADS 0.0.0.0/0 10.155.136.1 1
Get values from looped interactive commands like "monitor"
Frequently asked question s how to get values in script returned by, for example, monitor command? First problem with such commands is that they are
running infinitely until user action is applied, obviously you cannot do that from script. Instead you can run with additional parameter once, it will allow to
execute command only once and stop. Another problem is getting variable value sin script, there is no as-value, there is no get, but they have do. What it
does is allows to access variables returned by the command as in example below:
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /interface> monitor-traffic ether1 once do={:global myBps $"rx-bits-per-second" }
...
[admin@1p_DUT_wAP ac] /interface> :environment print
myBps=71464
Get file content received by fetch tool
Fetch tool allows for ease of use downloading file content into memory and allowing to access this data by script. To make it work use as-value parameter
and output=user:
[admin@rack1_b34_CCR1036] > :put ([/tool fetch ftp://admin:@10.155.136.41/test.txt
output=user as-value ]->"data")
my file content
Check script permissions
Lets say we have a script that creates and writes content to the file:
/system script add name=script1 policy=ftp,read,write source={
/file print file=test;
/file set test.txt content="my content"
}
Now lets add scheduler that will try to execute this script:
/system scheduler
add interval=10s name=test on-event=script2 policy=read,write
So now we wait 10 seconds, file not created, we wait another 10 seconds and still no file. What is going on? If you look closely script requires policy "ftp",
to create a file, but scheduler has only "read" and "write" policies, so script will not be executed. Fix is to set scheduler to run with correct policies "read,
write,ftp".
This applies also if you are trying to run script from netwatch, ppp on event and so on, which are limited to specific policies "read,write,test,reboot", so you
will not be able to run advanced scripts that creates backups, creates files and so on.
Limitation could be fixed by using dont-require-permissions, but be very careful, read below.
Be careful when using dont-require-permissions
It is possible to set script with dont-require-permissions parameter. Basically it allows anyone without adequate permissions to execute the script. For
example, if script has policies "read,write,test,sensitive", but user or application that executes the script has less, for example, "read,write", then by setting d
ont-require-permissions=yes will allow to run script anyway.
This could potentially allow to change sensitive information using script even if user doe snot have enough permissions.

# Clock

## Introduction
RouterOS uses data from the TZ database, Most of the time zones from this database are included, and have the same names. Because local time on the
router is used mostly for timestamping and time-dependent configuration, and not for historical date calculations, time zone information about past years is
not included. Currently, only information starting from 2005 is included.
Following settings are available in the /system clock console path and in the "Time" tab of the "System > Clock" WinBox window.
Startup date and time is jan/02/1970 00:00:00 [+|-]gmt-offset.

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
time (HH:MM:SS); where HH - hour 00..24, MM - minutes 00..59, SS - seconds 00..59).
```
```
date (mmm/DD/YYYY); where mmm - month, one of jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec, DD - date, 00..31, YYYY - year, 1970..
2037): date and time show current local time on the router. These values can be adjusted using the set command. Local
time cannot, however, be exported, and is not stored with the rest of the configuration.
```
```
time-zone-name (manual,
or name of time zone;
default value: manual);
```
```
Name of the time zone. As most of the text values in RouterOS, this value is case sensitive. Special value manual applies m
anually configured GMT offset, which by default is 00:00 with no daylight saving time.
```
```
time-zone-autodetect (yes
or no; default: yes);
```
```
Feature available from v6.27. If enabled, the time zone will be set automatically.
```

dst-active (yes or no>; read-only property): This property has the value yes while daylight saving time of the current time zone is active.
gmt-offset ([+|-]HH:MM - offset in hours and minutes; read-only property): This is the current value of GMT offset used by the system, after
applying base time zone offset and active daylight saving time offset.
```

## Manual time zone configuration
These settings are available in /system clock manual console path and in the "Manual Time Zone" tab of the "System > Clock" WinBox window. These
settings have an effect only when time-zone-name=manual. It is only possible to manually configure single daylight saving time period.
```
time-zone, dst-delta ([+|-]HH:MM - time offset in hours and minutes, leading plus sign is optional; default value: +00:00) : While DST is not active
use GMT offset time-zone. While DST is active use GMT offset time-zone + dst-delta.
dst-start, dst-end (mmm/DD/YYYY HH:MM: SS - date and time, either date or time can be omitted in the set command; default value: jan/01/1970
00:00:00): Local time when DST starts and ends.
```
```
Time-zone-autodetect by default is enabled on new RouterOS installation and after configuration reset. The time zone is detected depending
on the router's public IP address and our Cloud servers database. Since RouterOS v6.43 your device will use cloud2.mikrotik.com to
communicate with MikroTik's Cloud server. Older versions will use cloud.mikrotik.com to communicate with the MikroTik's Cloud server.
```


# Device-mode
The device-mode is a feature which sets specific limitations on a device, or limits access to specific configuration options. Such feature is required in order
to protect your router and network from attackers who might in some way gain access to your router and use it as a gateway for attacks to other networks.
By protecting your device in such a way, even if an attacker manages to gain access to your unprotected device, he will not be able to use it in order to
abuse your or any other network.
There are three available modes: advanced, home and basic. Device modes are factory pre-installed to routers, if the router is manufactured and shipped
with MikroTik RouterOS v7.17 or later. Advanced (previously called enterprise) mode is assigned to CCR and 1100 series devices, home mode is assigned
to home routers and basic mode to any other type of device. For devices running versions prior to RouterOS version 7.17, all devices use the advanced
/enterprise mode.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print
mode: advanced
allowed-versions: 7.13+,6.49.8+
flagged: no
flagging-enabled: yes
scheduler: yes
socks: yes
fetch: yes
pptp: yes
l2tp: yes
bandwidth-test: yes
traffic-gen: no
sniffer: yes
ipsec: yes
romon: yes
proxy: yes
hotspot: yes
smb: yes
email: yes
zerotier: yes
container: no
install-any-version: no
partitions: no
routerboard: yes
attempt-count: 0
```
The device-mode can be changed by the user, but remote access to the device is not enough to change it. After changing the device-mode, you need to
confirm it, by pressing a button on the device itself, or perform a "cold reboot" - that is, unplug the power. When the change is confirmed, regardless of
confirmation mode, the device will be rebooted!
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home
update: please activate by turning power off or pressing reset or mode button
in 5m00s
-- [Q quit|D dump|C-z pause]
```
If no power off or button press is performed within the specified time, the mode change is canceled. If another update command is run in parallel, both will
be canceled.
In order to protect your device against attacker who might silently gain access to your router, abuse it with some scripts and simply try to wait until you will
reboot your router and not even know that at that time you are accepting changes requested by some intruder, you can "update" mode only three times.
There is a counter which will count how many update attempts are made and will not allow any more updates. This counter can be reset only when
administrator does power-cycle the router or press a button when seeing such a warning on mode settings update attempt (same as with accepting any
updates).
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update container=yes
update: too many unsuccessful attempts, turn off power or reboot by pressing reset or mode button in 4m55s to
reset attempt-count
```
```
There are several EOL products which do not "confirm" mode changes with a reset button press. These routers can confirm mode change only
with a power cycle.
```
The following commands are available in the /system/device-mode menu:
```
Property Description
```
```
get Returns value that you can assign to variable or print on the screen.
```
```
print Shows the active mode and its properties.
```
```
update Applies changes to the specified properties, see below.
```
Available device-mode modes
There are three device modes available for configuration (mode=advanced is default one), each mode has a subset of features that are not allowed when it
is used. Note that there is no mode, which has all features enabled. Certain features need to be enabled even if you have "advanced" mode enabled. See
section "Feature clarification" for more details about what each option means. So, as per the below table it can be seen that "traffic-gen, container,
partitions, routerboard" features are always disabled, unless specifically enabled by the admin user.
```
Mode Description of disabled features
```
```
advanced
(default)
```
```
traffic-gen, container, install-any-version, partitions, routerboard
```
```

```
```
The list of available features, which can be controlled with the device-mode option. See
section "Feature clarification" for more details about what each option means.
```
```
activation-timeout (default: 5m); The reset button or power off activation timeout can be set in range 00:00:10 .. 1d00:00:00.
If the reset button is not pressed (or cold reboot is not performed) during this interval, the
update will be canceled.
```
```
flagging-enabled (yes | no; Default: yes) Enable or disable the flagged status. See below for a detailed description.
```
```
flagged (yes | no; Default: no) RouterOS employs various mechanisms to detect tampering with it's system files. If the
system has detected unauthorized access to RouterOS, the status "flagged" is set to yes. If
"flagged" is set to yes, for your safety, certain limitations are put in place. See below chapter
for more information.
```
```
mode: (basic, home, advanced; default: advanced); Allows choosing from available modes that will limit device functionality.
```
```
By default, advanced mode allows options except traffic-gen, container, partitions, install-
any-version, routerboard. So to use these features, you will need to turn it on by performing
a device-mode update.
```
```
By default, home mode disables the following features: scheduler, socks, fetch, bandwidth-
test, traffic-gen, sniffer, romon, proxy, hotspot, email, zerotier, container, install-any-version,
partitions, routerboard.
```
More specific control over the available features is possible. Each of the features controlled by device-mode can be specifically turned on or off.
For instance scheduler won't allow to perform any action at system scheduler. Used device-mode disables all listed features, for instance  mode=home is
used, but zerotier is required for your setup, device-mode update /system device-mode update zerotier=yes will be required with the physical access to
device to push the button or cut the power.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home email=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=advanced zerotier=no
```
If the update command specifies any of the mode parameters, this update replaces the entire device-mode configuration. In this case, all "per-feature"
settings will be lost, except those specified with this command. For instance:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=home email=yes fetch=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config
mode: home
fetch: yes
email: yes
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update mode=advanced sniffer=no
-- reboot --
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config
mode: advanced
sniffer: no
```
We see that fetch = yes and email = yes is missing, as they were overriden with the mode change. However, specifying only "per-feature" settings will
change only those:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/update hotspot=no
-- reboot --
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config
mode: advanced
sniffer: no
hotspot: no
```
If the feature is disabled, an error message is displayed for interactive commands:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print config
mode: advanced
sniffer: no
hotspot: no
[admin@MikroTik] > tool/sniffer/quick
failure: not allowed by device-mode
```
However, it is possible to add the configuration to a disabled feature, but there will be a comment showing the disabled feature in the device-mode:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip hotspot/add interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > ip hotspot/print
Flags: X, S - HTTPS
Columns: NAME, INTERFACE, PROFILE, IDLE-TIMEOUT
# NAME INTERFACE PROFILE IDLE-TIMEOUT
;;; inactivated, not allowed by device-mode

Allowed versions
Device mode lists in its parameters an argument called "allowed-versions". This is a list of versions which MikroTik considers as secure and which ones do
not include any serious vulnerabilities which could be used by an attacker. This list can be updated to versions which includes some major changes in
RouterOS below which downgrade should not be allowed.
This setting does not depend on the installed RouterOS version and works as a separate mechanism, in order to disallow attacker to downgrade version
step-by-step in order to reach some vulnerable RouterOS release. This means that if you upgrade RouterOS to a release where a newer "allowed-
versions" list is available, oldest list will be overwritten. If you downgrade RouterOS, "allowed-versions" list will not change and will remain updated to the
latest list.
This list is ignored, if device-mode "install-any-version" is enabled.
Flagged status
Along with the device-mode feature, RouterOS now can analyze the whole configuration at system startup, to determine if there are any signs of
unauthorized access to your router. If suspicious configuration is detected, the suspicious configuration will be disabled and the flagged parameter will be
set to "yes". The device has now a Flagged state and enforces certain limitations.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/device-mode/print
mode: advanced
flagged: yes
sniffer: no
hotspot: no
```
If the system has this flagged status, the current configuration works, but it is not possible to perform the following actions:
bandwidth-test, traffic-generator, sniffer, as well as configuration actions that enable or create new configuration entries (it will still be possible to disable or
delete them) for the following programs: system scheduler, SOCKS proxy, pptp, l2tp, ipsec, proxy, smb.
When performing the aforementioned actions while the router has the flagged state, you will receive an error message:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool sniffer/quick
failure: configuration flagged, check all router configuration for unauthorized changes and update device-mode
[admin@MikroTik] > /int l2tp-client/add connect-to=1.1.1.1 user=user
failure: configuration flagged, check all router configuration for unauthorized changes and update device-mode
```
To exit the flagged state, you must perform the command "/system/device-mode/update flagged=no". The system will ask to either press a button, or issue
a hard reboot (cut power physically or do a hard reboot of the virtual machine).
Important! Although the system has disabled any malicious looking rules, which triggered the flagged state, it is crucial to inspect all of your configuration
for other unknown things, before exiting the flagged state. If your system has been flagged, assume that your system has been compromised and do a full
audit of all settings before re-enabling the system for use. After completing the audit, change all the system passwords and upgrade to the latest RouterOS
version.


# E-mail

1. Configure SMTP server
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool e-mail> set server=10.1.1.1 port=25 from="router@mydomain.com"
```
2. Add a new script named "export-send":
```
/export file=export
/tool e-mail send to="config@mydomain.com" subject="$[/system identity get name] export" \
body="$[/system clock get date] configuration file" file=export.rsc
```
3. Add scheduler to run our script:
```
/system scheduler add on-event="export-send" start-time=00:00:00 interval=24h
```
Send e-mail to a server using TLS/SSL encryption. For example, Google mail requires that.
1. configure a client to connect to the correct server:
```
After the Google mail added a new security policy that does not allow 3d-party devices to authenticate using your standard Gmail password →
you need to generate a 16-digit passcode ("App" password) and use it instead of your Gmail password. To configure this, navigate to the "Securi
ty>Signing in to Google" section settings and:
```
```
Enable 2-Step Verification;
Generate an App password.
```
```
Use the newly generated App password in the "set password=mypassword" setting shown below.
```
```
/tool e-mail
set address=smtp.gmail.com
set port=465
set tls=yes
set from=myuser@gmail.com
set user=myuser
set password=mypassword
```
2. send e-mail using send command:
```
/tool e-mail send to=myuser@anotherdomain.com subject="email test" body="email test"
```


# Fetch
```
Summary
Properties
Configuration Examples
Sending information to a remote host
Return value to a variable
```

## Summary
Fetch is one of the console tools in MikroTik RouterOS. It is used to copy files to/from a network device via HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or SFTP. It can also be
used to send POST/GET requests and send any kind of data to a remote server. In HTTPS mode by default, no certificate checks are made, setting check-
certificate to yes enables trust chain validation from the local certificate store (can be used only in HTTPS mode).

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
address (string; Default: ) IP address of the device to copy file from. Also at the end of the address you can specify "@vrf_name" in order to run
fetch on particular VRF. You can skip specifying address and specify only VRF on this parameter, if you use URL
parameter.
```
```
as-value (set | not-set;
Default: not-set)
```
```
Store the output in a variable, should be used with the output property.
```
```
ascii (yes | no; Default: no) Can be used with FTP and TFTP
```
```
certificate (string; Default: ) Certificate that should be used for host verification. Can be used only in HTTPS mode.
```
```
check-certificate (yes |
yes-without-crl | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables trust chain validation from local certificate store. yes-without-crl, validates a certificate, not performing CRL
check (certificate revocation list).  Can be used only in HTTPS mode.
```
```
dst-path (string; Default: ) Destination path. Can be used to download file directly into an external disk, for example.
```
```
duration (time; Default: ) Time how long fetch should run.
```
```
host (string; Default: ) A domain name or virtual domain name (if used on a website, from which you want to copy information). For example,
```
```
address=wiki.mikrotik.com host=forum.mikrotik.com
```
```
In this example the resolved ip address is the same (66.228.113.27), but hosts are different.
```
```
http-auth-scheme (basic|di
gest; Default: basic)
```
```
HTTP authentication scheme
```
```
http-method (delete|get|he
ad|post|put|patch; Default:
get)
```
```
HTTP method to use
```
```
http-data (string; Default: ) The data, that is going to be sent, when using PUT or POST methods. Data limit is 64Kb.
```
```

Default: *empty*)
```
```
List of all header fields and their values, in the form of http-header-field="h1:fff,h2:yyy" or http-header-
field="h:fff\\,yyy" (within a single header multiple values need to be "escaped" using two backlashes).
```
```
http-content-encoding (defl
ate|gzip; Default: *empty*)
```
```
Encodes the payload using gzip or deflate compression and adds a corresponding Content-Encoding header. Usable
for HTTP POST and PUT only.
```
```

10s)
```
```
Idle timeout since last read/write action.
```
```
keep-result (yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
If yes, creates an input file.
```
```
mode (ftp|http|https|sftp|tftp
; Default: http)
```
```
Choose the protocol of connection - http, https , ftp, sftp or tftp. Mode option is deprecated. To specify a protocol that
you wish to use, we advise using "url" parameter instead (for example, like this "url=sftp://your_IP_address").
```
```
output (none|file|user|user-
with-headers; Default: file)
```
```
Sets where to store the downloaded data.
```
```
none - do not store downloaded data
file - store downloaded data in a file

)
```
```
Only (S)FTP modes support upload. If enabled then fetch will be used to upload files to a remote server. Requires src-
path and dst-path parameters to be set.
```
```
url (string; Default: ) URL pointing to file. Can be used instead of address and src-path parameters.
```
```
user (string; Default: anony
mous)
```
```
Username, which is needed for authentication to the remote device.
```
Configuration Examples
The following example shows how to copy the file with filename "conf.rsc" from a device with ip address 192.168.88.2 by FTP protocol and save it as file
with filename "123.rsc". User and password are needed to login into the device.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool> fetch address=192.168.88.2 src-path=conf.rsc \
user=admin mode=ftp password=123 dst-path=123.rsc port=21 \
host="" keep-result=yes
```
Example to upload file to another router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool> fetch address=192.168.88.2 src-path=conf.rsc \
user=admin mode=ftp password=123 dst-path=123.rsc upload=yes
```
Another file download example that demonstrates the usage of url property.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /> /tool fetch url="https://www.mikrotik.com/img/netaddresses2.pdf" mode=http
status: finished
```
```
[admin@test_host] /> /file print
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
...
5 netaddresses2.pdf .pdf file 11547 jun/01/2010 11:59:51
```
Sending information to a remote host
It is possible to use an HTTP POST request to send information to a remote server, that is prepared to accept it. In the following example, we send
geographic coordinates to a PHP page:
```
/tool/fetch http-method=post http-header-field="Content-Type:application/json" http-data="{\"lat\":\"56.12\",\"
lon\":\"25.12\"}" url="https://testserver.lv/index.php"
```
In this example, the data is uploaded as a file. Important note, since variable data comes from a file, a file can only be in size up to 4KB. This is a limitation
of RouterOS variables.
```
/export file=export.rsc
```
```
:global data [/file get [/file find name=export.rsc] contents];
:global $url "https://prod-51.westeurope.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/blabla/triggers/manual/paths/invoke....";
```
```
/tool fetch mode=https http-method=put http-data=$data url=$url
```
Return value to a variable
It is possible to save the result of the fetch command to a variable. For example, it is possible to trigger a certain action based on the result that an HTTP
page returns. You can find a very simple example below that disables ether2 whenever a PHP page returns "0":

### {
```
:local result [/tool fetch url=https://10.0.0.1/disable_ether2.php as-value output=user];
:if ($result->"status" = "finished") do={
:if ($result->"data" = "0") do={
/interface ethernet set ether2 disabled=yes;
} else={
/interface ethernet set ether2 disabled=no;
}
}
}
```

```
Get file contents
Using the get command, it is possible to retrieve file contents only from files up to 60KB in size. For accessing contents of larger files, use command read.
The result is returned as an array.
For example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > :put [/file/get text.txt contents]
123456
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /file/read file=text.txt offset=2 chunk-size=3
data: 345
```

```
Property Description
```
```
chunk-size (integer [1..32768]; Default: ) Chunk size that will be read from file
```
```
If the device has a directory named "flash" in its file list, then files which you want to be kept after the system reboot/power cycle must be stored
within it. As anything outside of it is kept within a RAM disk and will be lost upon reboot. This does not include .npk upgrade files as they will be
applied by the upgrade process before the system discards the RAM drive content.
```
```
For multicore devices with a NAND flash memory (e.g. CCR series routers, RB4011iGS), RouterOS uses a write-back that will cache file
changes into RAM memory instead of writing them straight away into flash media. The file changes will be stored on the flash when it is
absolutely necessary, the writing can be delayed by up to 40 seconds. This helps to reduce CPU cycles which results in better performance.
However, this can cause empty or zero-length files when a device experiences a sudden power loss, because files were not fully saved on a
flash.
```
```
Until RouterOS 7.16
```
file (string; Default: ) File name from which to read
offset (integer; Default:) Specifies offset where to start read file


# Identity

## Overview
Setting the System's Identity provides a unique identifying name for when the system identifies itself to other routers in the network and when accessing
services such as DHCP, Neighbour Discovery, and default wireless SSID. The default system Identity is set to 'MikroTik'.

## Configuration
To set system identity in RouterOS:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system identity set name=New_Identity
[admin@New_Identity] >
```
The current System Identity is always displayed after the logged-in account name and with the print command:
```
[admin@New_Identity] /system identity>print
name: New_Identity
[admin@New_Identity] /system identity>
```

## SNMP
It is also possible to change the router system identity by SNMP set command:
```
snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.0.0 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s New_Identity
```
snmpset - Linux based SNMP application used for SNMP SET requests to set information on a network entity;
```
public - router's community name;
192.168.0.0 - IP address of the router;
1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 - SNMP value for router's identity;
```
```
System Identity has a 64 maximum character length
```

# Interface Lists
```
Summary
Lists
Members
```

## Summary
Allows defining a set of interfaces for easier interface management in the different interface-based configuration sections such as Neighbor Discovery,
Firewall, Bridge, and Internet Detect.

## Lists
Sub-menu: /interface list
This menu contains information about all interface lists available on the router. There are four predefined lists - all (contains all interfaces), none (contain
s no interfaces), dynamic (contains dynamic interfaces), and static (contains static interfaces). It is also possible to create additional interface lists.
```
Property Description
```
```
name (string) Name of the interface list
```
```
include (string) Defines interface list which members are included in the list. It is possible to add multiple lists separated by commas
```
```
exclude (string) Defines interface list which members are excluded from the list. It is possible to add multiple lists separated by commas
```
Members are added to the interface list in the following order:
```
include members are added to the interface list
exclude members are removed from the list
Statically configured members are added to the list
```

## Members
Sub-menu: /interface list member
This sub-menu contains information about statically configured interface members to each interface list. Note that dynamically added interfaces by include
and exclude statements are not represented in this sub-menu.
```
Property Description
```
```
interface (
string)
```
```
Name of the interface
```
```
list (string) Name of the interface list
```
```
Dynamic interfaces are interfaces that have a "dynamic" flag. Any interface that doesn't have a dynamic flag will be part of the static interface
list.
```
```
Care must be taken when working with bridges and lists. Adding a bridge as a member is not the same as adding all its ports! And adding all
slave ports as members is not the same as adding the bridge itself. This can particularly impact functionality of neighbor discovery.
```


# Neighbor discovery

Summary
Neighbor list
Discovery configuration
LLDP
```

## Summary
Neighbor Discovery protocols allow us to find devices compatible with MNDP (MikroTik Neighbor Discovery Protocol), CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol), or
LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) in the Layer2 broadcast domain. It can be used to map out your network.

## Neighbor list
The neighbor list shows all discovered neighbors in the Layer2 broadcast domain. It shows to which interface neighbor is connected, its IP/MAC
addresses, and other related parameters. The list is read-only, an example of a neighbor list is provided below:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip neighbor print

Discovery configuration
It is possible to change whether an interface participates in neighbor discovery or not using an Interface list. If the interface is included in the discovery
interface list, it will send out basic information about the system and process received discovery packets broadcasted in the Layer2 network. Removing an
interface from the interface list will disable both the discovery of neighbors on this interface and also the possibility of discovering this device itself on that
interface.
```
/ip neighbor discovery-settings
```
```
Property Description
```
```
discover-
interface-list (stri
ng; Default: static
)
```
```
Interface list on which members the discovery protocol will run on.
```
```
discover-interval
(time: 5s..
9h6m8s; Default:
30s)
```
```
Adjusts the frequency at which neighbor discovery packets are transmitted. It also adjusts the Time-to-Live (TTL) TLV value for CDP
and LLDP packets using the formula: (discover-interval * 4) + 1. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.16.
```
```
lldp-dcbx (yes |
no; Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send Data Center Bridging Capabilities Exchange Protocol (DCBX) TLVs, which allows to communicate switch QoS
settings and capabilities with other neighboring devices using LLDP. Only applies to CRS3xx, CRS5xx, CCR2116 and CCR2216
devices.
```
```
Enabled DCBX includes the following TLVs:
```
```
ETS (Enhanced Transmission Selection) Configuration TLV. This TLV is used to share the switch's ETS configuration. It
includes:
The willingness bit, which indicates whether the device is willing to accept QoS configuration from neighboring devices. In
RouterOS, the willing bit is set to disabled, meaning the switch will not accept remote configurations and instead uses its
own settings.
The priority assignment table, which maps priorities to specific traffic-class.
The bandwidth allocation table, where RouterOS calculates the percentage of bandwidth allocated to each queue based
on the weight property. This applies to queues using the high-priority-group in the /interface/ethernet
/switch/qos/tx-manager/queue settings.
The Transmission Selection Algorithm (TSA) table, where high-priority-group queues are assigned to ETS, strict
-priority queues to Strict Priority, and low-priority-group or non-hardware offloaded queues to the Vendor
Specific Algorithm.
ETS Recommendation TLV. This provides a recommendation on how neighboring devices should configure ETS. RouterOS
uses the same data as in the ETS Configuration TLV to give its recommendation.
Priority-based Flow Control Configuration TLV. This TLV is used to share PFC configuration. Similar to the ETS TLV, the
willingness bit is set to disabled, meaning the switch does not accept remote PFC configurations. PFC is enabled for specific
priorities based on settings configured under /interface/ethernet/switch/qos/priority-flow-control, and /inte
rface/ethernet/switch/qos/port.
Application Priority TLV. This TLV is used to communicate how different applications are prioritized in the network.
Application VLAN TLV. This TLV is used to share VLAN configurations for applications. RouterOS currently does not support
sending values in this TLV and will send an empty VLAN table instead.
```
```
lldp-mac-phy-
config (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send MAC/PHY Configuration/Status TLV in LLDP, which indicates the interface capabilities, current setting of the
duplex status, bit rate, and auto-negotiation. Only applies to the Ethernet interfaces. While TLV is optional in LLDP, it is mandatory
when sending LLDP-MED, meaning this TLV will be included when necessary even though the property is configured as disabled.
```
```
Starting from RouterOS v6.45, the number of neighbor entries are limited to (total RAM in megabytes)*16 per interface to avoid memory
exhaustion.
```
```
lldp-max-frame-
size (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to send Maximum Frame Size TLV in LLDP, which indicates the maximum frame size capability of the interface in bytes (l2
mtu + 18). Only applies to the Ethernet interfaces.
```
```
lldp-poe-power (
yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Two specific TLVs facilitate Power over Ethernet (PoE) management between Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) and Powered
Devices (PD):
```
```
IEEE 802.3 Organizationally Specific Power Via MDI TLV
TIA-1057 (LLDP-MED) Organizationally Specific Extended Power via MDI TLV
```
```
The lldp-poe-power attribute determines whether to transmit the IEEE 802.3 Organizationally Specific Power Via MDI TLV in
LLDP messages.
```
```
The transmission of LLDP-MED Organizationally Specific Extended Power via MDI TLV is not configurable. It is automatically
included in outgoing LLDP-MED packets when the remote device has transmitted LLDP-MED capability of receiving power.
```
```
These TLVs are relevant only for Ethernet interfaces that support PoE-Out. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.15,
and it replaces PoE-out port poe-lldp-enabled setting.
```
```
lldp-med-net-
policy-vlan (integ
er 0..4094;
Default: disabled)
```
```
Advertised VLAN ID for LLDP-MED Network Policy TLV. This allows assigning a VLAN ID for LLDP-MED capable devices, such as
VoIP phones. The TLV will only be added to interfaces where LLDP-MED capable devices are discovered. Other TLV values are
predefined and cannot be changed:
```
```
Application Type - Voice
VLAN Type - Tagged
L2 Priority - 0
DSCP Priority - 0
```
```
When used together with the bridge interface, the (R/M)STP protocol should be enabled with protocol-mode setting.
```
```
Additionally, other neighbor discovery protocols (e.g. CDP) should be excluded using protocol setting to avoid LLDP-MED
misconfiguration.
```
```
lldp-vlan-info (ye
s | no; Default: no
)
```
```
Whether to send IEEE 802.1 Organizationally Specific TLVs in LLDP related to VLANs.
```
```
When this setting is enabled, three TLVs are advertised:
```
```
Port VLAN ID. This applies to the bridge port's pvid property.
Port And Protocol VLAN ID. This TLV is not used and always indicates "not supported" and "not enabled".
VLAN Name. This includes up to 10 active VLANs from the "/interface/bridge/vlan" table.
```
```
These TLVs are relevant to interfaces that are added to a vlan-filtering bridge, and the setting is available since RouterOS version
7.16.
```
```
mode (rx-only |
tx-only | tx-and-
rx; Default: tx-
and-rx)
```
```
Selects the neighbor discovery packet sending and receiving mode. The setting is available since RouterOS version 7.7.
```
```
protocol (cdp |
lldp | mndp;
Default: cdp,lldp,
mndp)
```
```
List of used discovery protocols.
```
Since RouterOS v6.44, neighbor discovery is working on individual slave interfaces. Whenever a master interface (e.g. bonding or bridge) is included in the
discovery interface list, all its slave interfaces will automatically participate in neighbor discovery. It is possible to allow neighbor discovery only to some
slave interfaces. To do that, include the particular slave interface in the list and make sure that the master interface is not included.
```
/interface bonding
add name=bond1 slaves=ether5,ether6
/interface list
add name=only-ether5
/interface list member
add interface=ether5 list=only-ether5
/ip neighbor discovery-settings
set discover-interface-list=only-ether5
```
Now the neighbor list shows a master interface and actual slave interface on which a discovery message was received.
```
[admin@R2] > ip neighbor print

```
LLDP
Depending on RouterOS configuration, different type-length-value (TLV) can be sent in the LLDP message, this includes:
```
Chassis ID (MAC address)
Port ID (interface name)
Time To Live
System Name (system identity)
System Description (platform - MikroTik, software version - RouterOS version,  hardware name - RouterBoard name)
Management Address (all IP addresses configured on the port)

SNTP Client properties:
Client settings example:
NTP Server settings:
RouterOS version 7
NTP Client properties:
NTP Server settings:
Log messages
```
RouterOS v6 implements the SNTP protocol defined in RFC4330, manycast mode is not supported. SNTP client is included in the system package. To use
an NTP server, ntp package must be installed and enabled.
RouterOS v7 main package includes NTP client and server functionality, which is based on RFC5905.
The client configuration is located in the /system ntp client console path, and the "System > SNTP Client" (RouterOS version 6), "System > NTP Client"
(RouterOS version 7) WinBox window. This configuration is shared by the SNTP client implementation in the system package and the NTP client
implementation in the ntp package. When ntp package is installed and enabled, the SNTP client is disabled automatically.

## RouterOS version 6

## SNTP Client properties:
```
Property Description
```
```
enabled (yes, no
default: no)
```
```
Enable SNTP client for time synchronization
```
```
mode (broadcast,
unicast, filed is read-
only)
```
```
Mode that the SNTP client will operate in. If no NTP servers are configured broadcast mode will be used. If there is a dynamic
or static NTP server IP address or FQDN used it will automatically switch to unicast mode.
```
```
primary-ntp (IP
address default: 0.0.0
.0)
```
```
IP address of the NTP server that has to be used for time synchronization. If both values are non-zero, then the SNTP client will
alternate between the two server addresses, switching to the other when the request to the current server times out or when the
"KoD" packet is received, indicating that the server is not willing to respond to requests from this client.
```
```
The following formats are accepted:
```
- ipv4
- ipv6
```
secondary-ntp (IP
address default: 0.0.0
.0)
```
```
see primary-ntp
```
```
server-dns-names (C
omma separated
domain name list
default: )
```
```
To set the NTP server using its domain name. The domain name will be resolved each time an NTP request is sent. Router has
to have /ip dns configured.
```
Status
```
active-server (IP address; read-only property) : Currently selected NTP server address. This value is equal to primary-ntp or secondary-ntp.
poll-interval (Time interval; read-only property) : Current interval between requests sent to the active server. The initial value is 16 seconds, and it
is increased by doubling to 15 minutes.
```
Last received packet information
Values of the following properties are reset when the SNTP client is stopped or restarted, either because of a configuration change, or because of a
network error.
```
last-update-from (IP address; read-only property) : Source IP address of the last received NTP server packed that was successfully processed.
```
```
last-update-before (Time interval; read-only property) : Time since the last successfully received server message.
last-adjustment (Time interval; read-only property) : Amount of clock adjustment that was calculated from the last successfully received NTP
server message.
last-bad-packet-from (IP address; read-only property) : Source IP address of last received SNTP packed that was not successfully processed.
Reason of the failure and time since this packet was received is available in the next two properties.
last-bad-packet-before (Time interval; read-only property) : Time since the last receive failure.
last-bad-packet-reason (Text; read-only property) : Text that describes the reason of the last receive failure. Possible values are:
bad-packet-length - Packet length is not in the acceptable range.
server-not-synchronized - Leap Indicator field is set to "alarm condition" value, which means that clock on the server has not been
synchronized yet.
zero-transmit-timestamp - Transmit Timestamp field value is 0.
bad-mode - Value of the Mode field is neither 'server' nor 'broadcast'.
kod-ABCD - Received "KoD" (Kiss-o'-Death) response. ABCD is the short "kiss code" text from the Reference Identifier field.
broadcast - Received proadcast message, but mode=unicast.
non-broadcast - Received packed was server reply, but mode=broadcast.
server-ip-mismatch - Received response from address that is not active-server.
originate-timestamp-mismatch - Originate Timestamp field in the server response message is not the same as the one included in the
last request.
roundtrip-too-long - request/response roundtrip exceeded 1 second.
```

```
Log messages
SNTP client can produce the following log messages. See the article "log" on how to set up logging and how to inspect logs.
```
ntp,debug gradually adjust by OFFS
ntp,debug instantly adjust by OFFS
ntp,debug Wait for N seconds before sending the next message
ntp,debug Wait for N seconds before restarting
ntp,debug,packet packet receive an error, restarting
ntp,debug,packet received PKT
ntp,debug,packet ignoring received PKT
ntp,debug,packet error sending to IP, restarting
ntp,debug,packet sending to IP PKT
```
Explanation of log message fields
```
OFFS - difference of two NTP timestamp values, in hexadecimal.
PKT - dump of NTP packet. If the packet is shorter than the minimum 48 bytes, it is dumped as a hexadecimal string. Otherwise, the packet is
dumped as a list of field names and values, one per log line. Names of fields follow RFC4330.
IP - remote IP address.
```
NOTE: the above logging rules work only with the built-in SNTP client, the separate NTP package doesn't have any logging facilities.


# Partitions

## Summary
Partitioning is supported on ARM, ARM64, MIPS, TILE, and PowerPC RouterBOARD type devices.
It is possible to partition NAND flash, allowing to install own OS on each partition and specify primary and fallback partitions.
If a partition should fail for some reason (failed upgrade, problematic configuration introduced, software problem), the next partition will boot instead. This
can be used as an interactive backup where you keep a verified working installation and upgrade only some secondary partition. If you upgrade your
configuration, and it proves to be good, you can use the "save config" button to copy it over to other partitions.
Minimum partition sizes:
```
32MB on MIPS
40MB on PowerPC
48MB on TILE
```
The maximum number of allowed partitions is 8.

## Summary
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), is a protocol used to synchronize clocks
across a local area network. It is essential in industries and applications where precise timing is critical, such as telecommunications, finance, and
industrial automation. PTP typically ensures time accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, but nanosecond-level accuracy is also achievable when
hardware requirements are met. MikroTik’s implementation of PTP supports IEEE 1588-2008 (PTPv2) and includes hardware timestamping capabilities
that ensure synchronization within the nanosecond range. For additional details on MikroTik’s PTP features, please refer to the list below.

## Supported Features:
```
Two-step Ordinary Clock and Boundary Clock.
Hardware timestamping, ensuring clock syncronization in nanosecond(ns) range.
IPv4 and Layer 2 (L2) multicast transport modes.
End-to-End (E2E) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) delay mechanisms.
IEEE 1588-2008 (PTPv2)
Profile Support for:
802.1AS: Audio Video Bridging (AVB) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
AES67: High-performance audio-over-IP interoperability.
G.8275.1: Frequency and phase synchronization in PTP-aware networks.
SMPTE: Audio/video synchronization in professional broadcast environments
```

auto)
```
```
Parameter which takes part in the election of a backup grandmaster clock.
```
```
profile (802.1as; aes67; g8275.1;
smpte; default; Default: default)
```
```
Each profile comes with its own predefined auto values for PTP operating parameters and options:
```
```
802.1as is an adaptation of PTP for use with Audio Video Bridging and Time-Sensitive Networking. Auto
values: priority1=246, priority2=248, transport=l2, delay-mode=p2p.
aes67 profile is for high-performance audio-over-IP interoperability. Auto values: priority1=128,
priority2=128, domain=0, transport=ipv4, delay-mode=e2e.
g8275.1 profile is for frequency and phase synchronization in a fully PTP-aware network. Auto values:
priority1=128, priority2=128, domain=24, transport=l2, delay-mode=e2e.
smpte profile is for the synchronization of audio/video equipment in a professional broadcast environment.
Auto values: priority1=128, priority2=128, domain=127, transport=ipv4, delay-mode=e2e.
default profile, PTPv2 default configuration, allows for more configuration options than other profiles. Auto
values: priority1=128, priority2=128, domain=0, transport=ipv4, delay-mode=e2e.
```
```
transport (auto; ipv4; l2-forwardable;
l2-non-forwardable; Default: auto)
```
```
Transport protocol to be used:
```
```
auto - automatically selects the transport mode based on the PTP profile in use.
ipv4 - uses the IPv4 multicast addresses 224.0.1.129 for PTP primary messages and 224.0.0.107 for PTP
peer delay messages.
l2-forwardable - uses the multicast MAC address 01-1B-19-00-00-00, which is being forwarded
through PTP-unaware network equipment.
l2-non-forwardable - uses the multicast MAC address 01-80-C2-00-00-0E, ensuring that PTP
messages are not forwarded through PTP-unaware network equipment.
```
Configuration
Configuring Precision Time Protocol (PTP) on MikroTik devices is a straightforward process. The primary steps involve creating a PTP profile and
assigning the relevant ports to this profile for PTP operation.
Create a PTP Profile
To create a PTP profile, use the following command. In this example, we use the 802.1as profile, but you can select from other available profiles as
needed:
```
/system ptp add name=ptp1 profile=802.1as
```
To verify that the profile has been created successfully, execute:
```
/system ptp print
```
The output will display the created profile with its current settings:
```
Flags: I - inactive, X - disabled
0 name="ptp1" priority1=auto priority2=auto delay-mode=auto transport=auto profile=802.1as domain=auto
```
Assign Ports to the PTP Profile
As the final step, assign the ports that will participate in PTP. For example, lets include ether1 (connected to the grandmaster clock) and ether2
(connected to an ordinary clock/slave):
```
By default, parameters for each profile are configured to "auto," which automatically selects the appropriate values based on the profile chosen.
Before making manual adjustments, verify that the settings conform to relevant standards (e.g., ITU-T G.8275.1, IEEE 802.1as, SMPTE,
AES67).
```
```
/system ptp port add interface=ether1 ptp=ptp1
/system ptp port add interface=ether2 ptp=ptp1
```
Monitoring
To monitor the status and performance of the PTP profile, use the following command:
```
/system ptp monitor 0
```
The output will provide detailed information about the profile's operational status:
```
name: ptp1
clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AD:C7
priority1: 246
priority2: 248
i-am-gm: no
gm-clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AE:C3
gm-priority1: 100
gm-priority2: 248
master-clock-id: 64:D1:54:FF:FE:EB:AE:C3
slave-port: ether1
freq-drift: 2690 ppb
offset: 3 ns
hw-offset: -889419842 ns
slave-port-delay: 306 ns
```
This information includes critical details such as the clock IDs, priority values, and timing offsets, which are essential for monitoring the accuracy and
synchronization of your PTP setup.

# Scheduler

## Summary
The scheduler can trigger script execution at a particular time moment, after a specified time interval, or both.

## Properties
```
interval (time; default: 0s) - interval between two script executions, if time interval is set to zero, the script is only executed at its start time,
otherwise it is executed repeatedly at the time interval is specified
name name) - name of the task
on-event (name) - name of the script to execute. It must be presented at /system script
run-count (read-only: integer) - to monitor script usage, this counter is incremented each time the script is executed
start-date (date) - date of the first script execution
start-time (time) - time of the first script execution
startup - execute the script 3 seconds after the system startup.
```

## Notes
Rebooting the router will reset the run-count counter.
If more than one script has to be executed simultaneously, they are executed in the order they appear in the scheduler configuration. This can be important
if one scheduled script is used to disable another one.
If a more complex execution pattern is needed, it can usually be done by scheduling several scripts, and making them enable and disable each other.
Note: if scheduler item has start-time set to startup, it behaves as if start-time and start-date were set to time 3 seconds after console starts up. It means
that all scripts having start-time is startup and interval is 0 will be executed once each time router boots. If the interval is set to value other
than 0 scheduler will not run at startup

## Examples
We will add a task that executes the script log-test every hour:
```
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=log-test source=":log info message=test"
[admin@MikroTik] system script> print
Flags: I - invalid
0 name="log-test" owner="admin" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon dont-
require-permissions=no run-count=0
source=:log info message=test
[admin@MikroTik] system script> .. scheduler
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> add name=run-1h interval=1h
on-event=log-test
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME ON-EVENT START-DATE START-TIME INTERVAL RUN-COUNT
0 run-1h log-test mar/30/2004 06:11:35 1h 0
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler>
```
In another example, there will be two scripts added that will change the bandwidth setting of a queue rule "Cust0". Every day at 9AM the queue will be set
to 64Kb/s and at 5PM the queue will be set to 128Kb/s. The queue rule, the scripts, and the scheduler tasks are below:
```
[admin@MikroTik] queue simple> add name=Cust0 interface=ether1 \
\... dst-address=192.168.0.0/24 limit-at=64000
[admin@MikroTik] queue simple> print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid 0 name="Cust0" target-address=0.0.0.0/0 dst-address=192.168.0.0/24
interface=ether1 limit-at=64000 queue=default priority=8 bounded=yes
[admin@MikroTik] queue simple> /system script
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=start_limit source={/queue simple set \
\... Cust0 limit-at=64000}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=stop_limit source={/queue simple set \
\... Cust0 limit-at=128000}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> print
0 name="start_limit" source="/queue simple set Cust0 limit-at=64000"
owner=admin run-count=0
1 name="stop_limit" source="/queue simple set Cust0 limit-at=128000"
owner=admin run-count=0
[admin@MikroTik] system script> .. scheduler
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> add interval=24h name="set-64k" \
\... start-time=9:00:00 on-event=start_limit
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> add interval=24h name="set-128k" \
\... start-time=17:00:00 on-event=stop_limit
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME ON-EVENT START-DATE START-TIME INTERVAL RUN-COUNT
0 set-64k start... oct/30/2008 09:00:00 1d 0
1 set-128k stop_... oct/30/2008 17:00:00 1d 0
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler>
```
The following example schedules a script that sends each week a backup of router configuration by e-mail.
```
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=e-backup source={/system backup
{... save name=email; /tool e-mail send to="root@host.com" subject=([/system
{... identity get name]. " Backup") file=email.backup}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> print
0 name="e-backup" source="/system backup save name=ema... owner=admin run-count=0
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] system script> .. scheduler
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> add interval=7d name="email-backup" \
\... on-event=e-backup
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME ON-EVENT START-DATE START-TIME INTERVAL RUN-COUNT
0 email-... e-backup oct/30/2008 15:19:28 7d 1
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler>
```
Do not forget to set the e-mail settings, i.e., the SMTP server and From: address under /tool e-mail. For example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] tool e-mail> set server=159.148.147.198 from=SysAdmin@host.com
[admin@MikroTik] tool e-mail> print
server: 159.148.147.198
from: SysAdmin@host.com
[admin@MikroTik] tool e-mail>
```
Example below will put 'x' in logs each hour from midnight till noon:
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=enable-x source={/system scheduler
{... enable x}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=disable-x source={/system scheduler
{... disable x}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> add name=log-x source={:log info message=x}
[admin@MikroTik] system script> .. scheduler
[admin@MikroTik] system scheduler> add name=x-up start-time=00:00:00 \

Introduction
Parameters
Settings
Regexp
Examples
```

## Introduction
Trivial File Transfer Protocol or simply TFTP is a very simple protocol used to transfer files. Each nonterminal packet is acknowledged separately.
```
ip/tftp/
```
This menu contains all TFTP access rules. If in this menu are no rules, the TFTP server is not started when RouterOS boots. This menu only shows 1
additional attribute compared to what you can set when creating a rule.

## Parameters
```
Property Description
```
```
ip-address
(required)
```
```
Range of IP addresses accepted as clients if empty 0.0.0.0/0 will be used
```
```
allow-
rollover (D
efault: No)
```
```
If set to yes TFTP server will allow the sequence number to roll over when the maximum value is reached. This is used to enable large
downloads using the TFTP server.
```
```
req-
filename
```
```
Requested filename as a regular expression (regex) if a field is left empty it defaults to .*
```
```
real-
filename
```
```
If req-filename and real-filename values are set and valid, the requested filename will be replaced with matched file. This field has to be
set. If multiple regex is specified in req-filename, with this field you can set which ones should match, so this rule is validated. The real-
filename format for using multiple regex is filename\0\5\6
```
```
allow (def
ault: yes)
```
```
To allow connection if the above fields are set. if no, a connection will be interrupted
```
```
read-only (
default: no)
```
```
Sets if a file can be written to, if set to "yes" write attempt will fail with error
```
```
hits (read-
only)

asterisk "*" - match zero or more times preceding symbol:
```
example 1 a* will match any length name consisting purely of symbols a or no symbols at all
example 2 .* will match any length name, also, empty field
example 3 as*df will match adf, asdf, assdf, asssdf etc.
```
plus "+" will match one or more times the preceding symbol:
```
example: as+df will match asdf, assdf etc.
```
dot "." - matches any symbol:
```
example as.f will match asdf, asbf ashf etc.
```
square brackets [] - variation between:
```
example as[df] will match asd and asf
```
question mark "?" will match one or no symbols:
```
example asd?f will match asdf and asf
```
caret "^" - used at the beginning of the line means that the line starts with;
dollar "$" - means at the end of the line.
Examples
If a file is requested return the file from the store called sata1:
```
/ip tftp add req-filename=file.txt real-filename=/sata1/file.txt allow=yes read-only=yes
```
If we want to give out one specific file no matter what the user is requesting:
```
/ip tftp add req-filename=.* real-filename=/sata1/file.txt allow=yes read-only=yes
```
If the user requests aaa.bin or bbb.bin then give them ccc.bin:
```
/ip tftp add req-filename="(aaa.bin)|(bbb.bin)" real-filename="/sata1/ccc.bin\\0" allow=yes read-only=yes
```
```
RouterOS receives TFTP requests, but the client gets a transfer timeout?
```
```
Some embedded clients request large block sizes and yet do not handle fragmented packets correctly. For these clients, it is recommended to
set "max-block-size" on the RouterOS side or "blksize" on Client-side to the value of the smallest MTU on your network minus 32 bytes (20
bytes for IP, 8 for UDP, and 4 for TFTP) and more if you use IP options on your network.

## Summary
Sub-menu: /interface 6to4
6to4 is a special mechanism that allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over IPv4 networks without the need of explicitly configured tunnel interfaces. It is
especially useful for connecting two or more IPv6 networks over a network that does not have IPv6 support. There are two different ways of 6to4
mechanism. If remote-address is not configured, the router will encapsulate and send an IPv6 packet directly over IPv4 if the first 16 bits are 2002 , using
the next 32 bits as the destination (IPv4 address converted to hex). In other case, the IPv6 packet will be sent directly to the IPv4 remote-address.

## Introduction
Sub-menu: /interface eoip
Ethernet over IP (EoIP) Tunneling is a MikroTik RouterOS protocol based on GRE RFC 1701 that creates an Ethernet tunnel between two routers on top of
an IP connection. The EoIP tunnel may run over IPIP tunnel, PPTP tunnel, or any other connection capable of transporting IP.
When the bridging function of the router is enabled, all Ethernet traffic (all Ethernet protocols) will be bridged just as if there where a physical Ethernet
interface and cable between the two routers (with bridging enabled). This protocol makes multiple network schemes possible.
Network setups with EoIP interfaces:
```
Possibility to bridge LANs over the Internet
Possibility to bridge LANs over encrypted tunnels
Possibility to bridge LANs over 802.11b 'ad-hoc' wireless networks
```
The EoIP protocol encapsulates Ethernet frames in GRE (IP protocol number 47) packets (just like PPTP) and sends them to the remote side of the EoIP
tunnel.

## Introduction
Sub-menu: /interface gre
Standards: RFC1701
GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) is a tunneling protocol that was originally developed by Cisco. It can encapsulate a wide variety of protocols creating
a virtual point-to-point link.
GRE is the same as IPIP and EoIP which were originally developed as stateless tunnels. This means that if the remote end of the tunnel goes down, all
traffic that was routed over the tunnels will get blackholed. To solve this problem, RouterOS has added a 'keepalive' feature for GRE tunnels.

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-fast-path (y
es | no; Default: y
es)
```
```
Whether to allow FastPath processing. Must be disabled if IPsec tunneling is used.
```
```
clamp-tcp-mss (y

```
```
Controls whether to change MSS size for received TCP SYN packets. When enabled, a router will change the MSS size for
received TCP SYN packets if the current MSS size exceeds the tunnel interface MTU (taking into account the TCP/IP overhead).
The received encapsulated packet will still contain the original MSS, and only after decapsulation the MSS is changed.
```
```
comment (string;
Default: )
```
```
Short description of the tunnel.
```
```
disabled (yes | no
; Default: no)
```
```
Enables/disables tunnel.
```
```
dont-fragment (in
herit | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to include DF bit in related packets:
```
```
no - fragment if needed, inherit - use Dont Fragment flag of original packet.
```
```
(Without Dont Fragment: inherit - packet may be fragmented).
```
```
dscp (inherit |
integer [0-63];
Default: )
```
```
Set dscp value in Gre header to a fixed value or inherit from dscp value taken from tunnelled traffic
```
```
ipsec-secret (string
; Default: )
```
```
When secret is specified, router adds dynamic IPsec peer to remote-address with pre-shared key and policy (by default phase2
uses sha1/aes128cbc).
```
```
keepalive (integer
[/time],integer 0..
4294967295 ;
Default: 10s,10)
```
```
Tunnel keepalive parameter sets the time interval in which the tunnel running flag will remain even if the remote end of tunnel goes
down. If configured time,retries fail, interface running flag is removed. Parameters are written in following format: KeepaliveInter
val,KeepaliveRetries where KeepaliveInterval is time interval and KeepaliveRetries - number of retry attempts. By default
keepalive is set to 10 seconds and 10 retries.
```
```
l2mtu (integer [0..
65536]; Default: 6
5535 )
```
```
Layer2 Maximum transmission unit.
```
```
GRE tunnel adds a 24 byte overhead (4-byte gre header + 20-byte IP header). GRE tunnel can forward only IP and IPv6 packets (ethernet type
800 and 86dd). Do not use the "Check gateway" option "arp" when a GRE tunnel is used as a route gateway.
```
```
local-address (IP;
Default: 0.0.0.0)
```
```
IP address that will be used for local tunnel end. If set to 0.0.0.0 then IP address of outgoing interface will be used.

```
```
Layer3 Maximum transmission unit.
```
```
name (string;
Default: )
```
```
Name of the tunnel.
```
```
remote-address (IP
; Default: )
```
```
IP address of remote tunnel end.
```
Setup example
The goal of this example is to get Layer 3 connectivity between two remote sites over the internet
We have two sites, Site1 with local network range 10.1.101.0/24 and Site2 with local network range 10.1.202.0/24.
The first step is to create GRE tunnels. A router on site 1:
```
/interface gre add name=myGre remote-address=192.168.90.1 local-address=192.168.80.1
```
A router on site 2:
```
/interface gre add name=myGre remote-address=192.168.80.1 local-address=192.168.90.1
```
As you can see tunnel configuration is quite simple.
Now we just need to set up tunnel addresses and proper routing. A router on site 1:
```
In this example, a keepalive is not configured, so tunnel interface will have a running flag even if remote tunnel end is not reachable
```
```
/ip address add address=172.16.1.1/30 interface=myGre
/ip route add dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.2
```
A router on site 2:
```
/ip address add address=172.16.1.2/30 interface=myGre
/ip route add dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1
```
At this point, both sites have Layer 3 connectivity over the GRE tunnel.

Example
Suppose we want to add an IPIP tunnel between routers R1 and R2:
At first, we need to configure IPIP interfaces and then add IP addresses to them.
The configuration for router R1 is as follows:
```
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> add
local-address: 10.0.0.1
remote-address: 22.63.11.6
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
# NAME MTU LOCAL-ADDRESS REMOTE-ADDRESS
0 X ipip1 1480 10.0.0.1 22.63.11.6
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> en 0
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> /ip address add address=1.1.1.1/24 interface=ipip1
```
The configuration of the R2 is shown below:
```
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> add local-address=22.63.11.6 remote-address=10.
0.0.1
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
# NAME MTU LOCAL-ADDRESS REMOTE-ADDRESS
0 X ipip1 1480 22.63.11.6 10.0.0.1
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> enable 0
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> /ip address add address=1.1.1.2/24 interface=ipip1
```
Now both routers can ping each other:
```
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip> /ping 1.1.1.2
1.1.1.2 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=24 ms
1.1.1.2 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=19 ms
1.1.1.2 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=20 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 19/21.0/24 ms
[admin@MikroTik] interface ipip>
```

Introduction
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a set of protocols defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to secure packet exchange over unprotected
IP/IPv6 networks such as the Internet.
IPsec protocol suite can be divided into the following groups:
```
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols. Dynamically generates and distributes cryptographic keys for AH and ESP.
Authentication Header (AH) RFC 4302
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) RFC 4303
```
Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE)
The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a protocol that provides authenticated keying material for the Internet Security Association and Key Management
Protocol (ISAKMP) framework. There are other key exchange schemes that work with ISAKMP, but IKE is the most widely used one. Together they
provide means for authentication of hosts and automatic management of security associations (SA).
Most of the time IKE daemon is doing nothing. There are two possible situations when it is activated:
There is some traffic caught by a policy rule which needs to become encrypted or authenticated, but the policy doesn't have any SAs. The policy notifies
the IKE daemon about that, and the IKE daemon initiates a connection to a remote host. IKE daemon responds to remote connection. In both cases, peers
establish a connection and execute 2 phases:
```
Phase 1 - The peers agree upon algorithms they will use in the following IKE messages and authenticate. The keying material used to derive keys
for all SAs and to protect following ISAKMP exchanges between hosts is generated also. This phase should match the following settings:
authentication method
DH group
encryption algorithm
exchange mode
hash algorithm
NAT-T
DPD and lifetime (optional)
```
```
Phase 2 - The peers establish one or more SAs that will be used by IPsec to encrypt data. All SAs established by the IKE daemon will have
lifetime values (either limiting time, after which SA will become invalid, or the amount of data that can be encrypted by this SA, or both). This
phase should match the following settings:
IPsec protocol
mode (tunnel or transport)
authentication method
PFS (DH) group
lifetime
```
```
There are two lifetime values - soft and hard. When SA reaches its soft lifetime threshold, the IKE daemon receives a notice and starts another
phase 2 exchange to replace this SA with a fresh one. If SA reaches a hard lifetime, it is discarded.
```
```
Phase 1 is not re-keyed if DPD is disabled when the lifetime expires, only phase 2 is re-keyed. To force phase 1 re-key, enable DPD.
```
IKE can optionally provide a Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), which is a property of key exchanges, that, in turn, means for IKE that compromising the long
term phase 1 key will not allow to easily gain access to all IPsec data that is protected by SAs established through this phase 1. It means an additional
keying material is generated for each phase 2.
The generation of keying material is computationally very expensive. Exempli Gratia, the use of the modp8192 group can take several seconds even on a
very fast computer. It usually takes place once per phase 1 exchange, which happens only once between any host pair and then is kept for a long time.
PFS adds this expensive operation also to each phase 2 exchange.
Diffie-Hellman Groups
Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol allows two parties without any initial shared secret to create one securely. The following Modular Exponential
(MODP) and ECP Diffie-Hellman (also known as "Oakley") Groups are supported:
```
Diffie-Hellman Group Name Reference
```
```
Group 1 768 bits MODP group RFC 2409
```
```
Group 2 1024 bits MODP group RFC 2409

```
Group 5 1536 bits MODP group RFC 3526
```
```
Group 14 2048 bits MODP group RFC 3526
```
```
Group 15 3072 bits MODP group RFC 3526
```
```
Group 16 4096 bits MODP group RFC 3526
```
```
Group 17 6144 bits MODP group RFC 3526
```
```
Group 18 8192 bits MODP group RFC 3526

```
Group 19 256 bits random ECP group RFC 5903
```
```
Group 20 384 bits random ECP group RFC 5903
```
```
Group 21 521 bits random ECP group RFC 5903
```
More on standards can be found here.
Larger DH groups offer better security but require more CPU power. Here are a few commonly used DH groups with varying levels of security and CPU
impact:
DH Group 14 (2048-bit) - Provides a reasonable balance between security and CPU usage. It offers 2048-bit key exchange, which is considered secure for
most applications today and is widely supported.
DH Group 5 (1536-bit) - Offers a slightly lower level of security compared to DH Group 14 but has a lower CPU impact due to the smaller key size. It is still
considered secure for many scenarios.
DH Group 2 (1024-bit) - Should be used with caution because it provides the least security among commonly used groups. It has a lower CPU impact but
is susceptible to attacks, especially as computational power increases. It's generally not recommended for new deployments.
For optimal security, it's advisable to use DH Group 19. It's considered fast and secure. DH Group 2 should generally be avoided unless you have legacy
devices that require it.
```
PSK authentication was known to be vulnerable against Offline attacks in "aggressive" mode, however recent discoveries indicate that offline
attack is possible also in the case of "main" and "ike2" exchange modes. A general recommendation is to avoid using the PSK authentication
method.
```
```
The correct way of calculating security for your network infrastructure would be to choose how many bits of security you want and you could see
how long it would require to decrypt your data, then you have to choose algorithms. Please see information for reference https://www.keylength.
com/en/4/
```
IKE Traffic
To avoid problems with IKE packets hit some SPD rule and require to encrypt it with not yet established SA (that this packet perhaps is trying to establish),
locally originated packets with UDP source port 500 are not processed with SPD. The same way packets with UDP destination port 500 that are to be
delivered locally are not processed in incoming policy checks.
Setup Procedure
To get IPsec to work with automatic keying using IKE-ISAKMP you will have to configure policy, peer, and proposal (optional) entries.

Authentication Header (AH)
```
IPsec is very sensitive to time changes. If both ends of the IPsec tunnel are not synchronizing time equally(for example, different NTP servers
not updating time with the same timestamp), tunnels will break and will have to be established again.
```
```
AES-GCM encryption support for IKEv2 authentication is not yet supported.
```
```
If using IPsec with certificate X.509 must contain "SubjectKeyIdentifier" extension, which is supported only in version 3.
```
```
Using ed25519 - authentication is not yet supported.
```
AH is a protocol that provides authentication of either all or part of the contents of a datagram through the addition of a header that is calculated based on
the values in the datagram. What parts of the datagram are used for the calculation, and the placement of the header depends on whether tunnel or
transport mode is used.
The presence of the AH header allows to verify the integrity of the message but doesn't encrypt it. Thus, AH provides authentication but not privacy.
Another protocol (ESP) is considered superior, it provides data privacy and also its own authentication method.
RouterOS supports the following authentication algorithms for AH:
```
SHA2 (256, 512)
SHA1
MD5
```
Transport mode
In transport mode, the AH header is inserted after the IP header. IP data and header is used to calculate authentication value. IP fields that might change
during transit, like TTL and hop count, are set to zero values before authentication.
Tunnel mode
In tunnel mode, the original IP packet is encapsulated within a new IP packet. All of the original IP packets are authenticated.
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) uses shared key encryption to provide data privacy. ESP also supports its own authentication scheme like that used
in AH.
ESP packages its fields in a very different way than AH. Instead of having just a header, it divides its fields into three components:
```
ESP Header - Comes before the encrypted data and its placement depends on whether ESP is used in transport mode or tunnel mode.
ESP Trailer - This section is placed after the encrypted data. It contains padding that is used to align the encrypted data.
ESP Authentication Data - This field contains an Integrity Check Value (ICV), computed in a manner similar to how the AH protocol works, for
when ESP's optional authentication feature is used.
```
Transport mode
In transport mode, the ESP header is inserted after the original IP header. ESP trailer and authentication value are added to the end of the packet. In this
mode only the IP payload is encrypted and authenticated, the IP header is not secured.
Tunnel mode
In tunnel mode, an original IP packet is encapsulated within a new IP packet thus securing IP payload and IP header.
Encryption algorithms
RouterOS ESP supports various encryption and authentication algorithms.
Authentication:
```
MD5
SHA1
SHA2 (256-bit, 512-bit)
```
Encryption:
```
AES - 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key AES-CBC, AES-CTR, and AES-GCM algorithms;
Blowfish - added since v4.5
Twofish - added since v4.5
Camellia - 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key Camellia encryption algorithm added since v4.5
DES - 56-bit DES-CBC encryption algorithm;
3DES - 168-bit DES encryption algorithm;
```

Statistics
This menu shows various IPsec statistics and errors.
Read-only properties
```
Property Description
```
```
in-errors (integer) All inbound errors that are not matched by other counters.
```
```
in-buffer-errors (integer) No free buffer.
```
```
in-header-errors (integer) Header error.
```
```
in-no-states (integer) No state is found i.e. either inbound SPI, address, or IPsec protocol at SA is wrong.
```
```
in-state-protocol-errors (int
eger)
```
```
Transformation protocol-specific error, for example, SA key is wrong or hardware accelerator is unable to handle the
number of packets.
```
```
Policy order is important starting from v6.40. Now it works similarly to firewall filters where policies are executed from top to bottom (priority
parameter is removed).
```
```
All packets are IPIP encapsulated in tunnel mode, and their new IP header's src-address and dst-address are set to sa-src-address and sa-dst-
address values of this policy. If you do not use tunnel mode (id est you use transport mode), then only packets whose source and destination
addresses are the same as sa-src-address and sa-dst-address can be processed by this policy. Transport mode can only work with packets that
originate at and are destined for IPsec peers (hosts that established security associations). To encrypt traffic between networks (or a network
and a host) you have to use tunnel mode.

```
nat-traversal (yes | no; Default: yes) Use Linux NAT-T mechanism to solve IPsec incompatibility with NAT routers between IPsec peers. This can
only be used with ESP protocol (AH is not supported by design, as it signs the complete packet, including
the IP header, which is changed by NAT, rendering AH signature invalid). The method encapsulates IPsec
ESP traffic into UDP streams in order to overcome some minor issues that made ESP incompatible with
NAT.

will be able to connect. Note that the EAP method should be compatible with EAP-only;
pre-shared-key - authenticate by a password (pre-shared secret) string shared between the peers (not
recommended since an offline attack on the pre-shared key is possible);
rsa-key - authenticate using an RSA key imported in keys menu. Only supported in IKEv1;
pre-shared-key-xauth - authenticate by a password (pre-shared secret) string shared between the peers + XAuth
username and password. Only supported in IKEv1;

eap-peap - also known as PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2;
eap-tls - requires additional client certificate specified under certificate parameter;
eap-ttls.
```
```
generate-policy (no | port-
override | port-strict; Default: no)
```
```
Allow this peer to establish SA for non-existing policies. Such policies are created dynamically for the lifetime of SA.
Automatic policies allows, for example, to create IPsec secured L2TP tunnels, or any other setup where remote peer's
IP address is not known at the configuration time.
```

initiator. In IKEv2, responder also expects this ID in received ID_r from initiator.
```
```
auto - tries to use correct ID automatically: IP for pre-shared key, SAN (DN if not present) for certificate based
connections;
address - IP address is used as ID;
dn - the binary Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding of an ASN.1 X.500 Distinguished Name;

key required). If a remote-certificate is not specified then the received certificate from a remote peer is used and
checked against CA in the certificate menu. Proper CA must be imported in a certificate store. If remote-certificate and
match-by=certificate is specified, only the specific client certificate will be matched. Applicable if digital signature
authentication method (auth-method=digital-signature) is used.
```
```
remote-id (auto | fqdn | user-
fqdn | key-id | ignore; Default: a
uto)
```
```
This parameter controls what ID value to expect from the remote peer. Note that all types except for ignoring will verify
remote peer's ID with a received certificate. In case when the peer sends the certificate name as its ID, it is checked
against the certificate, else the ID is checked against Subject Alt. Name.
```
```
auto - accept all ID's;
address - IP address is used as ID;

Application Guides
RoadWarrior client with NAT
Consider setup as illustrated below. RouterOS acts as a RoadWarrior client connected to Office allowing access to its internal resources.
A tunnel is established, a local mode-config IP address is received and a set of dynamic policies are generated.
```
[admin@mikrotik] > ip ipsec policy print
Flags: T - template, X - disabled, D - dynamic, I - invalid, A - active, * - default
0 T * group=default src-address=::/0 dst-address=::/0 protocol=all proposal=default template=yes

sa-dst-address=10.155.107.9 proposal=default ph2-count=1
```
Currently, only packets with a source address of 192.168.77.254/32 will match the IPsec policies. For a local network to be able to reach remote subnets, it
is necessary to change the source address of local hosts to the dynamically assigned mode config IP address. It is possible to generate source NAT rules
dynamically. This can be done by creating a new address list that contains all local networks that the NAT rule should be applied. In our case, it is
192.168.88.0/24.
```
/ip firewall address-list add address=192.168.88.0/24 list=local-RW
```
By specifying the address list under the mode-config initiator configuration, a set of source NAT rules will be dynamically generated.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config set [ find name="request-only" ] src-address-list=local-RW
```
When the IPsec tunnel is established, we can see the dynamically created source NAT rules for each network. Now every host in 192.168.88.0/24 is able
to access Office's internal resources.
```

Allow only IPsec encapsulated traffic
There are some scenarios where for security reasons you would like to drop access from/to specific networks if incoming/outgoing packets are not
encrypted. For example, if we have L2TP/IPsec setup we would want to drop nonencrypted L2TP connection attempts.
There are several ways how to achieve this:
```
Using IPsec policy matcher in firewall;
Using generic IPsec policy with action set to drop and lower priority (can be used in Road Warrior setups where dynamic policies are generated);
By setting DSCP or priority in mangle and matching the same values in firewall after decapsulation.
```
IPsec policy matcher
Let's set up an IPsec policy matcher to accept all packets that matched any of the IPsec policies and drop the rest:
```
add chain=input comment="ipsec policy matcher" in-interface=WAN ipsec-policy=in,ipsec
add action=drop chain=input comment="drop all" in-interface=WAN log=yes
```
IPsec policy matcher takes two parameters direction, policy. We used incoming direction and IPsec policy. IPsec policy option allows us to inspect packets
after decapsulation, so for example, if we want to allow only GRE encapsulated packet from a specific source address and drop the rest we could set up
the following rules:
```
add chain=input comment="ipsec policy matcher" in-interface=WAN ipsec-policy=in,ipsec protocol=gre
src=address=192.168.33.1
add action=drop chain=input comment="drop all" in-interface=WAN log=yes
```
For L2TP rule set would be:
```
add chain=input comment="ipsec policy matcher" in-interface=WAN ipsec-policy=in,ipsec protocol=udp dst-port=1701
add action=drop chain=input protocol=udp dst-port=1701 comment="drop l2tp" in-interface=WAN log=yes
```
Using generic IPsec policy
The trick of this method is to add a default policy with an action drop. Let's assume we are running an L2TP/IPsec server on a public 1.1.1.1 address and
we want to drop all nonencrypted L2TP:
```
/ip ipsec policy
add src-address=1.1.1.1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 sa-src-address=1.1.1.1 protocol=udp src-port=1701 tunnel=yes
action=discard
```
Now router will drop any L2TP unencrypted incoming traffic, but after a successful L2TP/IPsec connection dynamic policy is created with higher priority
than it is on default static rule, and packets matching that dynamic rule can be forwarded.
```

Manually specifying local-address parameter under Peer configuration
Using different routing table
IPsec, as any other service in RouterOS, uses the main routing table regardless of what local-address parameter is used for Peer configuration. It is
necessary to apply routing marks to both IKE and IPSec traffic.
Consider the following example. There are two default routes - one in the main routing table and another in the routing table "backup". It is necessary to
use the backup link for the IPsec site to site tunnel.
```

```
IPsec peer and policy configurations are created using the backup link's source address, as well as the NAT bypass rule for IPsec tunnel traffic.
```
Policy order is important! For this to work, make sure the static drop policy is below the dynamic policies. Move it below the policy template if
necessary.
```
```

Currently, we see "phase1 negotiation failed due to time up" errors in the log. It is because IPsec tries to reach the remote peer using the main routing
table with an incorrect source address. It is necessary to mark UDP/500, UDP/4500, and ipsec-esp packets using Mangle:
```
/ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-connection chain=output connection-mark=no-mark dst-address=10.155.130.136 dst-port=500,4500
new-connection-mark=ipsec passthrough=yes protocol=udp

add action=mark-routing chain=output connection-mark=ipsec new-routing-mark=backup passthrough=no
```
Using the same routing table with multiple IP addresses
Consider the following example. There are multiple IP addresses from the same subnet on the public interface. Masquerade rule is configured on out-
interface. It is necessary to use one of the IP addresses explicitly.
```
[admin@pair_r1] > /ip address print

IPsec peer and policy configuration is created using one of the public IP addresses.

```
Currently, the phase 1 connection uses a different source address than we specified, and "phase1 negotiation failed due to time up" errors are shown in
the logs. This is because masquerade is changing the source address of the connection to match the pref-src address of the connected route. The solution
is to exclude connections from the public IP address from being masqueraded.
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=accept chain=srcnat protocol=udp src-port=500,4500 place-before=0
```
Application examples
Site to Site IPsec (IKEv1) tunnel
Consider setup as illustrated below. Two remote office routers are connected to the internet and office workstations are behind NAT. Each office has its
own local subnet, 10.1.202.0/24 for Office1 and 10.1.101.0/24 for Office2. Both remote offices need secure tunnels to local networks behind routers.
Site 1 configuration
Start off by creating a new Phase 1profileand Phase 2proposalentries using stronger or weaker encryption parameters that suit your needs. It is advised to
create separate entries for each menu so that they are unique for each peer in case it is necessary to adjust any of the settings in the future. These
parameters must match between the sites or else the connection will not establish.
```
/ip ipsec profile
add dh-group=modp2048 enc-algorithm=aes-128 name=ike1-site2
/ip ipsec proposal
add enc-algorithms=aes-128-cbc name=ike1-site2 pfs-group=modp2048
```
Continue by configuring a peer. Specify the address of the remote router. This address should be reachable through UDP/500 and UDP/4500 ports, so
make sure appropriate actions are taken regarding the router's firewall. Specify the name for this peer as well as the newly created profile.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=192.168.80.1/32 name=ike1-site2 profile=ike1-site2
```
The next step is to create an identity. For a basic pre-shared key secured tunnel, there is nothing much to set except for a strong secret and the peer to
which this identity applies.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add peer=ike1-site2 secret=thisisnotasecurepsk
```
```
If security matters, consider using IKEv2 and a different auth-method.
```
Lastly, create a policy that controls the networks/hosts between whom traffic should be encrypted.
```
/ip ipsec policy
add src-address=10.1.202.0/24 src-port=any dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 dst-port=any tunnel=yes action=encrypt
proposal=ike1-site2 peer=ike1-site2
```
Site 2 configuration
Office 2 configuration is almost identical to Office 1 with proper IP address configuration. Start off by creating a new Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal e
ntries:
```
/ip ipsec profile
add dh-group=modp2048 enc-algorithm=aes-128 name=ike1-site1
/ip ipsec proposal
add enc-algorithms=aes-128-cbc name=ike1-site1 pfs-group=modp2048
```
Next is the peer and identity:
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=192.168.90.1/32 name=ike1-site1 profile=ike1-site1
/ip ipsec identity
add peer=ike1-site1 secret=thisisnotasecurepsk
```
When it is done, create a policy:
```
/ip ipsec policy
add src-address=10.1.101.0/24 src-port=any dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 dst-port=any tunnel=yes action=encrypt
proposal=ike1-site1 peer=ike1-site1
```
At this point, the tunnel should be established and two IPsec Security Associations should be created on both routers:
```
/ip ipsec
active-peers print
installed-sa print
```
NAT and Fasttrack Bypass
At this point if you try to send traffic over the IPsec tunnel, it will not work, packets will be lost. This is because both routers have NAT rules (masquerade)
that are changing source addresses before a packet is encrypted. A router is unable to encrypt the packet because the source address does not match the
address specified in the policy configuration. For more information see the IPsec packet flow example.
To fix this we need to set up IP/Firewall/NAT bypass rule.
Office 1 router:
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=accept place-before=0 src-address=10.1.202.0/24 dst-address=10.1.101.0/24
```
Office 2 router:
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=accept place-before=0 src-address=10.1.101.0/24 dst-address=10.1.202.0/24
```
It is very important that the bypass rule is placed at the top of all other NAT rules.
Another issue is if you have IP/Fasttrack enabled, the packet bypasses IPsec policies. So we need to add accept rule before FastTrack.
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=accept place-before=1
src-address=10.1.101.0/24 dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 connection-state=established,related
add chain=forward action=accept place-before=1
src-address=10.1.202.0/24 dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 connection-state=established,related
```
However, this can add a significant load to the router's CPU if there is a fair amount of tunnels and significant traffic on each tunnel.
The solution is to use IP/Firewall/Raw to bypass connection tracking, that way eliminating the need for filter rules listed above and reducing the load on
CPU by approximately 30%.
```
/ip firewall raw
add action=notrack chain=prerouting src-address=10.1.101.0/24 dst-address=10.1.202.0/24
add action=notrack chain=prerouting src-address=10.1.202.0/24 dst-address=10.1.101.0/24
```
Site to Site GRE tunnel over IPsec (IKEv2) using DNS
This example explains how it is possible to establish a secure and encrypted GRE tunnel between two RouterOS devices when one or both sites do not
have a static IP address. Before making this configuration possible, it is necessary to have a DNS name assigned to one of the devices which will act as a
responder (server). For simplicity, we will use RouterOS built-in DDNS service IP/Cloud.
Site 1 (server) configuration
This is the side that will listen to incoming connections and act as a responder. We will use mode config to provide an IP address for the second site, but
first, create a loopback (blank) bridge and assign an IP address to it that will be used later for GRE tunnel establishment.
```
If you previously tried to establish an IP connection before the NAT bypass rule was added, you have to clear the connection table from the
existing connection or restart both routers.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=loopback
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1 interface=loopback
```
Continuing with the IPsec configuration, start off by creating a new Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal entries using stronger or weaker encryption
parameters that suit your needs. Note that this configuration example will listen to all incoming IKEv2 requests, meaning the profile configuration will be
shared between all other configurations (e.g. RoadWarrior).
```
/ip ipsec profile
add dh-group=ecp256,modp2048,modp1024 enc-algorithm=aes-256,aes-192,aes-128 name=ike2
/ip ipsec proposal
add auth-algorithms=null enc-algorithms=aes-128-gcm name=ike2-gre pfs-group=none
```
Next, create a new mode config entry with responder=yes. This will provide an IP configuration for the other site as well as the host (loopback address) for
policy generation.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config
add address=192.168.99.2 address-prefix-length=32 name=ike2-gre split-include=192.168.99.1/32 system-dns=no
```
It is advised to create a new policy group to separate this configuration from any existing or future IPsec configuration.
```
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=ike2-gre
```
Now it is time to set up a new policy template that will match the remote peers new dynamic address and the loopback address.
```
/ip ipsec policy
add dst-address=192.168.99.2/32 group=ike2-gre proposal=ike2-gre src-address=192.168.99.1/32 template=yes
```
The next step is to create a peer configuration that will listen to all IKEv2 requests. If you already have such an entry, you can skip this step.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add exchange-mode=ike2 name=ike2 passive=yes profile=ike2
```
Lastly, set up an identity that will match our remote peer by pre-shared-key authentication with a specific secret.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=ike2-gre peer=ike2 policy-template-group=ike2-gre secret=test
```
The server side is now configured and listening to all IKEv2 requests. Please make sure the firewall is not blocking UDP/4500 port.
The last step is to create the GRE interface itself. This can also be done later when an IPsec connection is established from the client-side.
```
/interface gre
add local-address=192.168.99.1 name=gre-tunnel1 remote-address=192.168.99.2
```
Configure IP address and route to remote network through GRE interface.
```
/ip address
add address=172.16.1.1/30 interface=gre-tunnel1
/ip route
add dst-network=10.1.202.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.2
```
Site 2 (client) configuration
Similarly to server configuration, start off by creating a new Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal configurations. Since this site will be the initiator, we can
use a more specific profile configuration to control which exact encryption parameters are used, just make sure they overlap with what is configured on the
server-side.
```
/ip ipsec profile
add dh-group=ecp256 enc-algorithm=aes-256 name=ike2-gre
/ip ipsec proposal
add auth-algorithms=null enc-algorithms=aes-128-gcm name=ike2-gre pfs-group=none
```
Next, create a new mode config entry with responder=no. This will make sure the peer requests IP and split-network configuration from the server.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config
add name=ike2-gre responder=no
```
It is also advised to create a new policy group to separate this configuration from any existing or future IPsec configuration.
```
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=ike2-gre
```
Create a new policy template on the client-side as well.
```
/ip ipsec policy
add dst-address=192.168.99.1/32 group=ike2-gre proposal=ike2-gre src-address=192.168.99.2/32 template=yes
```
Move on to peer configuration. Now we can specify the DNS name for the server under the address parameter. Obviously, you can use an IP address as
well.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=n.mynetname.net exchange-mode=ike2 name=p1.ez profile=ike2-gre
```
Lastly, create an identity for our newly created peers.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=ike2-gre peer=p1.ez policy-template-group=ike2-gre secret=test
```
If everything was done properly, there should be a new dynamic policy present.
```
/ip ipsec policy print
Flags: T - template, X - disabled, D - dynamic, I - invalid, A - active, * - default
0 T * group=default src-address=::/0 dst-address=::/0 protocol=all proposal=default template=yes
```
```
1 T group=ike2-gre src-address=192.168.99.2/32 dst-address=192.168.99.1/32 protocol=all proposal=ike2-gre
template=yes
```
```
2 DA src-address=192.168.99.2/32 src-port=any dst-address=192.168.99.1/32 dst-port=any protocol=all
action=encrypt level=unique ipsec-protocols=esp
tunnel=yes sa-src-address=192.168.90.1 sa-dst-address=(current IP of n.mynetname.net) proposal=ike2-gre ph2-
count=1
```
A secure tunnel is now established between both sites which will encrypt all traffic between 192.168.99.2 <=> 192.168.99.1 addresses. We can use these
addresses to create a GRE tunnel.
```
/interface gre
add local-address=192.168.99.2 name=gre-tunnel1 remote-address=192.168.99.1
```
Configure IP address and route to remote network through GRE interface.
```
/ip address
add address=172.16.1.2/30 interface=gre-tunnel1
/ip route
add dst-network=10.1.101.0/24 gateway=172.16.1.1
```
Road Warrior setup using IKEv2 with RSA authentication
This example explains how to establish a secure IPsec connection between a device connected to the Internet (road warrior client) and a device running
RouterOS acting as a server.
RouterOS server configuration
Before configuring IPsec, it is required to set up certificates. It is possible to use a separate Certificate Authority for certificate management, however in this
example, self-signed certificates are generated in RouterOS System/Certificates menu. Some certificate requirements should be met to connect various
devices to the server:
```
Common name should contain IP or DNS name of the server;
SAN (subject alternative name) should have IP or DNS of the server;
EKU (extended key usage) tls-server and tls-client are required.
```
Considering all requirements above, generate CA and server certificates:
```
/certificate
add common-name=ca name=ca
sign ca ca-crl-host=2.2.2.2
add common-name=2.2.2.2 subject-alt-name=IP:2.2.2.2 key-usage=tls-server name=server1
sign server1 ca=ca
```
Now that valid certificates are created on the router, add a new Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal entries with pfs-group=none:
```
/ip ipsec profile
add name=ike2
/ip ipsec proposal
add name=ike2 pfs-group=none
```
Mode config is used for address distribution from IP/Pools:
```
/ip pool
add name=ike2-pool ranges=192.168.77.2-192.168.77.254
/ip ipsec mode-config
add address-pool=ike2-pool address-prefix-length=32 name=ike2-conf
```
Since that the policy template must be adjusted to allow only specific network policies, it is advised to create a separate policy group and template.
```
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=ike2-policies
/ip ipsec policy
add dst-address=192.168.77.0/24 group=ike2-policies proposal=ike2 src-address=0.0.0.0/0 template=yes
```
Create a new IPsec peer entry that will listen to all incoming IKEv2 requests.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add exchange-mode=ike2 name=ike2 passive=yes profile=ike2
```
Identity configuration
The identity menu allows to match specific remote peers and assign different configurations for each one of them. First, create a default identity, that will
accept all peers, but will verify the peer's identity with its certificate.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add auth-method=digital-signature certificate=server1 generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=ike2-conf
peer=ike2 policy-template-group=ike2-policies
```
For example, we want to assign a different mode config for user "A", who uses certificate "rw-client1" to authenticate itself to the server. First of all, make
sure a new mode config is created and ready to be applied for the specific user.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config
add address=192.168.66.2 address-prefix-length=32 name=usr_A split-include=192.168.55.0/24 system-dns=no
```
It is possible to apply this configuration for user "A" by using the match-by=certificate parameter and specifying his certificate with remote-certificate.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add auth-method=digital-signature certificate=server1 generate-policy=port-strict match-by=certificate mode-
config=usr_A peer=ike2 policy-template-group=ike2-policies remote-certificate=rw-client1
```
(Optional) Split tunnel configuration
Split tunneling is a method that allows road warrior clients to only access a specific secured network and at the same time send the rest of the traffic based
on their internal routing table (as opposed to sending all traffic over the tunnel). To configure split tunneling, changes to mode config parameters are
needed.
For example, we will allow our road warrior clients to only access the 10.5.8.0/24 network.
```
/ip ipsec mode-conf
set [find name="rw-conf"] split-include=10.5.8.0/24
```
It is also possible to send a specific DNS server for the client to use. By default, system-dns=yes is used, which sends DNS servers that are configured on
the router itself in IP/DNS. We can force the client to use a different DNS server by using the static-dns parameter.
```
If the peer's ID (ID_i) is not matching with the certificate it sends, the identity lookup will fail. See remote-id in the identities section.
```
```
/ip ipsec mode-conf
set [find name="rw-conf"] system-dns=no static-dns=10.5.8.1
```
While it is possible to adjust the IPsec policy template to only allow road warrior clients to generate policies to network configured by split-include parameter
, this can cause compatibility issues with different vendor implementations (see known limitations). Instead of adjusting the policy template, allow access to
a secured network in IP/Firewall/Filter and drop everything else.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=drop chain=forward src-address=192.168.77.0/24 dst-address=!10.5.8.0/24
```
Generating client certificates
To generate a new certificate for the client and sign it with a previously created CA.
```
/certificate
add common-name=rw-client1 name=rw-client1 key-usage=tls-client
sign rw-client1 ca=ca
```
PKCS12 format is accepted by most client implementations, so when exporting the certificate, make sure PKCS12 is specified.
```
/certificate
export-certificate rw-client1 export-passphrase=1234567890 type=pkcs12
```
A file named cert_export_rw-client1.p12 is now located in the routers System/File section. This file should be securely transported to the client's device.
Typically PKCS12 bundle contains also a CA certificate, but some vendors may not install this CA, so a self-signed CA certificate must be exported
separately using PEM format.
```
/certificate
export-certificate ca type=pem
```
A file named cert_export_ca.crt is now located in the routers System/File section. This file should also be securely transported to the client's device.
PEM is another certificate format for use in client software that does not support PKCS12. The principle is pretty much the same.
```
/certificate
export-certificate ca
export-certificate rw-client1 export-passphrase=1234567890
```
Three files are now located in the routers Files section: cert_export_ca.crt, cert_export_rw-client1.crt and cert_export_rw-client1.key which should be
securely transported to the client device.
Known limitations
Here is a list of known limitations by popular client software IKEv2 implementations.
```
Windows will always ignore networks received by split-include and request policy with destination 0.0.0.0/0 (TSr). When IPsec-SA is generated,
Windows requests DHCP option 249 to which RouterOS will respond with configured split-include networks automatically.
```
```
Both Apple macOS and iOS will only accept the first split-include network.
```
```
Both Apple macOS and iOS will use the DNS servers from system-dns and static-dns parameters only when 0.0.0.0/0 split-include is used.
```
```
While some implementations can make use of different PFS group for phase 2, it is advised to use pfs-group=none under proposals to avoid any
compatibility issues.
```
```
Split networking is not a security measure. The client (initiator) can still request a different Phase 2 traffic selector.
```
RouterOS client configuration
Import a PKCS12 format certificate in RouterOS.
```
/certificate import file-name=cert_export_RouterOS_client.p12 passphrase=1234567890
```
There should now be the self-signed CA certificate and the client certificate in the Certificate menu. Find out the name of the client certificate.
```
/certificate print
```
cert_export_RouterOS_client.p12_0 is the client certificate.
It is advised to create a separate Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal configurations to not interfere with any existing IPsec configuration.
```
/ip ipsec profile
add name=ike2-rw
/ip ipsec proposal
add name=ike2-rw pfs-group=none
```
While it is possible to use the default policy template for policy generation, it is better to create a new policy group and template to separate this
configuration from any other IPsec configuration.
```
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=ike2-rw
/ip ipsec policy
add group=ike2-rw proposal=ike2-rw template=yes
```
Create a new mode config entry with responder=no that will request configuration parameters from the server.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config
add name=ike2-rw responder=no
```
Lastly, create peer and identity configurations.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=2.2.2.2/32 exchange-mode=ike2 name=ike2-rw-client
/ip ipsec identity
add auth-method=digital-signature certificate=cert_export_RouterOS_client.p12_0 generate-policy=port-strict
mode-config=ike2-rw peer=ike2-rw-client policy-template-group=ike2-rw
```
Verify that the connection is successfully established.
```
/ip ipsec
active-peers print
installed-sa print
```
Enabling dynamic source NAT rule generation
If we look at the generated dynamic policies, we see that only traffic with a specific (received by mode config) source address will be sent through the
tunnel. But a router in most cases will need to route a specific device or network through the tunnel. In such case, we can use source NAT to change the
source address of packets to match the mode config address. Since the mode config address is dynamic, it is impossible to create a static source NAT
rule. In RouterOS, it is possible to generate dynamic source NAT rules for mode config clients.
For example, we have a local network 192.168.88.0/24 behind the router and we want all traffic from this network to be sent over the tunnel. First of all, we
have to make a new IP/Firewall/Address list which consists of our local network
```
/ip firewall address-list
add address=192.168.88.0/24 list=local
```
When it is done, we can assign the newly created IP/Firewall/Address list to the mode config configuration.
```
/ip ipsec mode-config
set [ find name=ike2-rw ] src-address-list=local
```
Verify correct source NAT rule is dynamically generated when the tunnel is established.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip firewall nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D ;;; ipsec mode-config
chain=srcnat action=src-nat to-addresses=192.168.77.254 src-address-list=local dst-address-list=!local
```
Windows client configuration
Open PKCS12 format certificate file on the Windows computer. Install the certificate by following the instructions. Make sure you select the Local Machine
store location.
You can now proceed to Network and Internet settings -> VPN and add a new configuration. Fill in the Connection name, Server name, or address
parameters. Select IKEv2 under VPN type. When it is done, it is necessary to select "Use machine certificates". This can be done in Network and Sharing
Center by clicking the Properties menu for the VPN connection. The setting is located under the Security tab.
```
Make sure the dynamic mode config address is not a part of a local network.

macOS client configuration
Open the PKCS12 format certificate file on the macOS computer and install the certificate in the "System" keychain. It is necessary to mark the CA
certificate as trusted manually since it is self-signed. Locate the certificate macOS Keychain Access app under the System tab and mark it as Always Trust.
You can now proceed to System Preferences -> Network and add a new configuration by clicking the + button. Select Interface: VPN, VPN Type: IKEv2
and name your connection. Remote ID must be set equal to common-name or subjAltName of server's certificate. Local ID can be left blank. Under
Authentication Settings select None and choose the client certificate. You can now test the connectivity.

iOS client configuration
Typically PKCS12 bundle contains also a CA certificate, but iOS does not install this CA, so a self-signed CA certificate must be installed separately using
PEM format. Open these files on the iOS device and install both certificates by following the instructions. It is necessary to mark the self-signed CA
certificate as trusted on the iOS device. This can be done in Settings -> General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings menu. When it is done, check
whether both certificates are marked as "verified" under the Settings -> General -> Profiles menu.
You can now proceed to Settings -> General -> VPN menu and add a new configuration. Remote ID must be set equal to common-name or subjAltName

Android (strongSwan) client configuration
Currently, there is no IKEv2 native support in Android, however, it is possible to use strongSwan from Google Play Store which brings IKEv2 to Android.
StrongSwan accepts PKCS12 format certificates, so before setting up the VPN connection in strongSwan, make sure you download the PKCS12 bundle to
your Android device. When it is done, create a new VPN profile in strongSwan, type in the server IP, and choose "IKEv2 Certificate" as VPN Type. When
selecting a User certificate, press Install and follow the certificate extract procedure by specifying the PKCS12 bundle. Save the profile and test the
connection by pressing on the VPN profile.
It is possible to specify custom encryption settings in strongSwan by ticking the "Show advanced settings" checkbox. Currently, strongSwan by default is

Road Warrior setup using IKEv2 with EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication handled by User Manager
(RouterOS v7)
This example explains how to establish a secure IPsec connection between a device connected to the Internet (road warrior client) and a device running
RouterOS acting as an IKEv2 server and User Manager. It is possible to run User Manager on a separate device in network, however in this example both
User Manager and IKEv2 server will be configured on the same device (Office).
RouterOS server configuration
Requirements
For this setup to work there are several prerequisites for the router:
```
Router's IP address should have a valid public DNS record - IP Cloud could be used to achieve this.
Router should be reachable through port TCP/80 over the Internet - if the server is behind NAT, port forwarding should be configured.
User Manager package should be installed on the router.
```
Generating Let's Encrypt certificate
During the EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication, TLS handshake has to take place, which means the server has to have a certificate that can be validated by
the client. To simplify this step, we will use Let's Encrypt certificate which can be validated by most operating systems without any intervention by the user.
To generate the certificate, simply enable SSL certificate under the Certificates menu. By default the command uses the dynamic DNS record provided by
IP Cloud, however a custom DNS name can also be specified. Note that, the DNS record should point to the router.
```
/certificate enable-ssl-certificate
```
If the certificate generation succeeded, you should see the Let's Encrypt certificate installed under the Certificates menu.
```
/certificate print detail where name~"letsencrypt"
```
Configuring User Manager
First of all, allow receiving RADIUS requests from the localhost (the router itself):
```
/user-manager router
add address=127.0.0.1 comment=localhost name=local shared-secret=test
```
Enable the User Manager and specify the Let's Encrypt certificate (replace the name of the certificate to the one installed on your device) that will be used
to authenticate the users.
```
/user-manager
set certificate="letsencrypt_2021-04-09T07:10:55Z" enabled=yes
```
Lastly add users and their credentials that clients will use to authenticate to the server.
```
/user-manager user
add name=user1 password=password
```
Configuring RADIUS client
For the router to use RADIUS server for user authentication, it is required to add a new RADIUS client that has the same shared secret that we already
configured on User Manager.
```
/radius
add address=127.0.0.1 secret=test service=ipsec
```
IPsec (IKEv2) server configuration
Add a new Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal entries with pfs-group=none:
```
/ip ipsec profile
add name=ike2
/ip ipsec proposal
add name=ike2 pfs-group=none
```
Mode config is used for address distribution from IP/Pools.
```
/ip pool
add name=ike2-pool ranges=192.168.77.2-192.168.77.254
/ip ipsec mode-config
add address-pool=ike2-pool address-prefix-length=32 name=ike2-conf
```
Since that the policy template must be adjusted to allow only specific network policies, it is advised to create a separate policy group and template.
```
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=ike2-policies
/ip ipsec policy
add dst-address=192.168.77.0/24 group=ike2-policies proposal=ike2 src-address=0.0.0.0/0 template=yes
```
Create a new IPsec peer entry which will listen to all incoming IKEv2 requests.
```
/ip ipsec peer
add exchange-mode=ike2 name=ike2 passive=yes profile=ike2
```
Lastly create a new IPsec identity entry that will match all clients trying to authenticate with EAP. Note that generated Let's Encrypt certificate must be
specified.
```
/ip ipsec identity
add auth-method=eap-radius certificate="letsencrypt_2021-04-09T07:10:55Z" generate-policy=port-strict mode-
config=ike2-conf peer=ike2 \
policy-template-group=ike2-policies
```
(Optional) Split tunnel configuration
Split tunneling is a method that allows road warrior clients to only access a specific secured network and at the same time send the rest of the traffic based
on their internal routing table (as opposed to sending all traffic over the tunnel). To configure split tunneling, changes to mode config parameters are
needed.
For example, we will allow our road warrior clients to only access the 10.5.8.0/24 network.
```
/ip ipsec mode-conf
set [find name="rw-conf"] split-include=10.5.8.0/24
```
It is also possible to send a specific DNS server for the client to use. By default, system-dns=yes is used, which sends DNS servers that are configured on
the router itself in IP/DNS. We can force the client to use a different DNS server by using the static-dns parameter.
```
/ip ipsec mode-conf
set [find name="rw-conf"] system-dns=no static-dns=10.5.8.1
```
(Optional) Assigning static IP address to user
Static IP address to any user can be assigned by use of RADIUS Framed-IP-Address attribute.
```
/user-manager user
set [find name="user1"] attributes=Framed-IP-Address:192.168.77.100 shared-users=1
```
(Optional) Accounting configuration
To keep track of every user's uptime, download and upload statistics, RADIUS accounting can be used. By default RADIUS accounting is already enabled
for IPsec, but it is advised to configure Interim Update timer that sends statistic to the RADIUS server regularly. If the router will handle a lot of
simultaneous sessions, it is advised to increase the update timer to avoid increased CPU usage.
```
/ip ipsec settings
set interim-update=1m
```
Basic L2TP/IPsec setup
This example demonstrates how to easily set up an L2TP/IPsec server on RouterOS for road warrior connections (works with Windows, Android, iOS,
macOS, and other vendor L2TP/IPsec implementations).
RouterOS server configuration
The first step is to enable the L2TP server:
```
Split networking is not a security measure. The client (initiator) can still request a different Phase 2 traffic selector.
```
```
To avoid any conflicts, the static IP address should be excluded from the IP pool of other users, as well as shared-users should be set to 1 for
the specific user.
```
```
/interface l2tp-server server
set enabled=yes use-ipsec=required ipsec-secret=mySecret default-profile=default
```
use-ipsec is set to required to make sure that only IPsec encapsulated L2TP connections are accepted.
Now what it does is enables an L2TP server and creates a dynamic IPsec peer with a specified secret.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /ip ipsec peer> print
0 D address=0.0.0.0/0 local-address=0.0.0.0 passive=yes port=500
auth-method=pre-shared-key secret="123" generate-policy=port-strict
exchange-mode=main-l2tp send-initial-contact=yes nat-traversal=yes
hash-algorithm=sha1 enc-algorithm=3des,aes-128,aes-192,aes-256
dh-group=modp1024 lifetime=1d dpd-interval=2m dpd-maximum-failures=5
```
The next step is to create a VPN pool and add some users.
```
/ip pool add name=vpn-pool range=192.168.99.2-192.168.99.100
```
```
/ppp profile
set default local-address=192.168.99.1 remote-address=vpn-pool
```
```
/ppp secret
add name=user1 password=123
add name=user2 password=234
```
Now the router is ready to accept L2TP/IPsec client connections.
RouterOS client configuration
For RouterOS to work as L2TP/IPsec client, it is as simple as adding a new L2TP client.
```
/interface l2tp-client
add connect-to=1.1.1.1 disabled=no ipsec-secret=mySecret name=l2tp-out1 \
password=123 use-ipsec=yes user=user1
```
It will automatically create dynamic IPsec peer and policy configurations.
Troubleshooting/FAQ

Peers are unable to negotiate encryption parameters causing the connection to drop. To solve this issue, enable IPSec to debug logs and find out which
parameters are proposed by the remote peer, and adjust the configuration accordingly.

In this example, the remote end requires SHA1 to be used as a hash algorithm, but MD5 is configured on the local router. Setting before the column
symbol (:) is configured on the local side, parameter after the column symbol (:) is configured on the remote side.
"phase1 negotiation failed due to time up" what does it mean?
There are communication problems between the peers. Possible causes include - misconfigured Phase 1 IP addresses; firewall blocking UDP ports 500
and 4500; NAT between peers not properly translating IPsec negotiation packets. This error message can also appear when a local-address parameter is
not used properly. More information available here.
Random packet drops or connections over the tunnel are very slow, enabling packet sniffer/torch fixes the problem?
Problem is that before encapsulation packets are sent to Fasttrack/FastPath, thus bypassing IPsec policy checking. The solution is to exclude traffic that
needs to be encapsulated/decapsulated from Fasttrack, see configuration example here.
How to enable ike2?
For basic configuration enabling ike2 is very simple, just change exchange-mode in peer settings to ike2.

Remote peer sent notify that it cannot accept proposed algorithms, to find the exact cause of the problem, look at remote peers debug logs or configuration
and verify that both client and server have the same set of algorithms.
I can ping only in one direction?
A typical problem in such cases is strict firewall, firewall rules allow the creation of new connections only in one direction. The solution is to recheck firewall
rules, or explicitly accept all traffic that should be encapsulated/decapsulated.
Can I allow only encrypted traffic?
Yes, you can, see "Allow only IPsec encapsulated traffic" examples.
I enable IKEv2 REAUTH on StrongSwan and got the error 'initiator did not reauthenticate as requested'
RouterOS does not support rfc4478, reauth must be disabled on StrongSwan.


# IKEv2 EAP between NordVPN and RouterOS

Installing the root CA
Finding out the server's hostname
Setting up the IPsec tunnel
Choosing what to send over the tunnel
Option 1: Sending all traffic over the tunnel
Option 2: Accessing certain addresses over the tunnel
```
Starting from RouterOS v6.45, it is possible to establish IKEv2 secured tunnel to NordVPN servers using EAP authentication. This manual page explains
how to configure it.

## Installing the root CA
Start off by downloading and importing the NordVPN root CA certificate.
/tool fetch url="https://downloads.nordvpn.com/certificates/root.der"
/certificate import file-name=root.der
There should now be the trusted NordVPN Root CA certificate in System/Certificates menu.
[admin@MikroTik] > /certificate print where name~"root.der"
Flags: K - private-key, L - crl, C - smart-card-key, A - authority, I - issued, R - revoked, E - expired, T -
trusted


# NAME COMMON-NAME SUBJECT-ALT-NAME
FINGERPRINT
0 T root.der_0 NordVPN Root CA
8b5a495db498a6c2c8c...

## Finding out the server's hostname
Navigate to https://nordvpn.com/servers/tools/ and find out the recommended server's hostname. In this case, it is lv20.nordvpn.com.
Setting up the IPsec tunnel
It is advised to create a separate Phase 1 profile and Phase 2 proposal configurations to not interfere with any existing or future IPsec configuration.
/ip ipsec profile
add name=NordVPN
/ip ipsec proposal
add name=NordVPN pfs-group=none
While it is possible to use the default policy template for policy generation, it is better to create a new policy group and template to separate this
configuration from any other IPsec configuration.
/ip ipsec policy group
add name=NordVPN
/ip ipsec policy
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 group=NordVPN proposal=NordVPN src-address=0.0.0.0/0 template=yes
Create a new mode config entry with responder=no that will request configuration parameters from the server.
/ip ipsec mode-config
add name=NordVPN responder=no
Lastly, create peer and identity configurations. Specify your NordVPN credentials in username and password parameters.
/ip ipsec peer
add address=lv20.nordvpn.com exchange-mode=ike2 name=NordVPN profile=NordVPN
/ip ipsec identity
add auth-method=eap certificate="" eap-methods=eap-mschapv2 generate-policy=port-strict mode-config=NordVPN
peer=NordVPN policy-template-group=NordVPN username=support@mikrotik.com password=secret
Verify that the connection is successfully established.
/ip ipsec
active-peers print
installed-sa print
Choosing what to send over the tunnel
If we look at the generated dynamic policies, we see that only traffic with a specific (received by mode config) source address will be sent through the
tunnel. But a router in most cases will need to route a specific device or network through the tunnel. In such a case, we can use source NAT to change the
source address of packets to match the mode config address. Since the mode config address is dynamic, it is impossible to create a static source NAT
rule. In RouterOS it is possible to generate dynamic source NAT rules for mode config clients.
Option 1: Sending all traffic over the tunnel
In this example, we have a local network 10.5.8.0/24 behind the router and we want all traffic from this network to be sent over the tunnel. First of all, we
have to make a new IP/Firewall/Address list which consists of our local network.
/ip firewall address-list
add address=10.5.8.0/24 list=local
It is also possible to specify only single hosts from which all traffic will be sent over the tunnel. Example:
/ip firewall address-list
add address=10.5.8.120 list=local
add address=10.5.8.23 list=local
When it is done, we can assign newly created IP/Firewall/Address list to mode config configuration.
/ip ipsec mode-config
set [ find name=NordVPN ] src-address-list=local
Verify correct source NAT rule is dynamically generated when the tunnel is established.
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip firewall nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D ;;; ipsec mode-config
chain=srcnat action=src-nat to-addresses=192.168.77.254 src-address-list=local dst-address-list=!local
Option 2: Accessing certain addresses over the tunnel
It is also possible to send only specific traffic over the tunnel by using the connection-mark parameter in the Mangle firewall. It works similarly as Option 1 -
a dynamic NAT rule is generated based on configured connection-mark parameter under mode config.
First of all, set the connection-mark under your mode config configuration.
/ip ipsec mode-config
set [ find name=NordVPN ] connection-mark=NordVPN
When it is done, a NAT rule is generated with the dynamic address provided by the server:
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip firewall nat print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
0 D ;;; ipsec mode-config
chain=srcnat action=src-nat to-addresses=192.168.77.254 connection-mark=NordVPN
After that, it is possible to apply this connection-mark to any traffic using Mangle firewall. In this example, access to mikrotik.com and 8.8.8.8 is granted
over the tunnel.
Create a new address list:
/ip firewall address-list
add address=mikrotik.com list=VPN
add address=8.8.8.8 list=VPN
Apply connection-mark to traffic matching the created address list:
/ip firewall mangle
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting dst-address-list=VPN new-connection-mark=NordVPN passthrough=yes
```
Warning
```
```
Make sure the dynamic mode config address is not a part of the local network.
```
```
It is also possible to combine both options (1 and 2) to allow access to specific addresses only for specific local addresses/networks
```

# L2TP

## Overview
Layer Two Tunneling Protocol "L2TP" extends the PPP model by allowing the L2 and PPP endpoints to reside on different devices interconnected by a
packet-switched network.  L2TP includes PPP authentication and accounting for each L2TP connection. Full authentication and accounting of each
connection may be done through a RADIUS client or locally. L2TP traffic uses UDP protocol for both control and data packets. UDP port 1701 is used only
for link establishment, further traffic is using any available UDP port (which may or may not be 1701). This means that L2TP can be used with most
firewalls and routers (even with NAT) by enabling UDP traffic to be routed through the firewall or router.  L2TP standard is defined in RFC 2661. The
L2TPv3 support added in 7.1 version. Support IPv4, IPv6.

## Introduction
It may be useful to use L2TP just as any other tunneling protocol with or without encryption. The L2TP standard says that the most secure way to encrypt
data is using L2TP over IPsec (Note that it is the default mode for Microsoft L2TP client) as all L2TP control and data packets for a particular tunnel appear
as homogeneous UDP/IP data packets to the IPsec system.
Multilink PPP (MP) is supported in order to provide MRRU (the ability to transmit full-sized 1500 and larger packets) and bridging over PPP links (using
Bridge Control Protocol (BCP) that allows sending raw Ethernet frames over PPP links). This way it is possible to setup bridging without EoIP. The bridge
should either have an administratively set MAC address or an Ethernet-like interface in it, as PPP links do not have MAC addresses.

L2TP Server
An interface is created for each tunnel established to the given server. There are two types of interfaces in the L2TP server's configuration
```
Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall rules or elsewhere) created for
the particular user;
Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and its username does not match any existing static entry
(or in case the entry is active already, as there can not be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same name);
```
Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that use
in router configuration (for example, in firewall), so if you need persistent rules for that user, create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to use a
dynamic configuration.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
Multiple L2tp/ipsec clients behind the same NAT will not work in this mode. To achieve such
scenario, disable use-ipsec and set static policies for clients with enabled tunnel=yes,

```
```
Maximum Transmission Unit. Max packet size that L2TP interface will be able to send without packet fragmentation.

# Quick Example
L2TP Server
On the servers side we will enable L2TP-server and create a PPP profile for a particular user:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface l2tp-server server set enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > /ppp secret add local-address=10.0.0.2 name=MT-User password=StrongPass profile=default-
encryption remote-address=10.0.0.1 service=l2tp
```
L2TP Client
L2TP client setup in the RouterOS is very simple.  In the following example, we already have a preconfigured 3 unit setup. We will take a look more
detailed on how to set up L2TP client with username "MT-User", password "StrongPass" and server 192.168.51.3:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface l2tp-client \
add connect-to=192.168.51.3 disabled=no name=MT-User password=StrongPass user=MT-User
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface l2tp-client print

Overview
Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) is a draft from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group. It introduces various improvements
to the original L2TP, allowing the encapsulation of Layer 2 (L2) payloads within L2TP. More precisely, L2TPv3 outlines the protocol for tunnelling Layer 2
payloads across an IP core network using L2 virtual private networks (VPNs).

# LAC and LNS setup with Cisco as LAC

LNS
Status Check

```

## Overview
LAC/LNS setup or otherwise known as Virtual Private DialUp Network (VPDN) allows long-distance point-to-point connection between remote dial-up
users and private networks.
Dial-up client uses PPPOE to connect to a L2TP access concentrator (LAC), LAC determines that session should be forwarded through a IP network to the
L2TP Network Server (LNS), creates L2TP tunnel and forwards PPP frames to the server where client is authenticated and session established (see
diagram below).
At the time of writing this article RouterOS cannot be used in LAC role. For this reason article will demonstrate how to set up very basic network with
RouterOS as LNS and Cisco router as LAC.

## Configuration
We will be using simple configuration to demonstrate very basics of VPDN setup. Lets assume that LAC will forward to the LNS clients with FQDN name
containing mt.lv domain.

## Client
For the sake of simplicity lets assume that client is RouterOS router:
```
/interface pppoe-client add interface=ether1 user=good_worker@mt.lv password=strongpass
```

## LAC
Lets assume that client is connected to the GigabitEthernet1 port and IP address of the LNS server is 10.155.101.231
```
aaa new-model
!
aaa authentication ppp default local
!

pppoe enable group MAIN-BBA
!

ppp mtu adaptive
ppp authentication chap
!
```
Note that this setup does not authenticate client nor locally nor via RADIUS, does not actually check domain name, does not control L2 access for the sake
of simplicity. If you want to use those features refer to Cisco configuration manuals.
LNS
On the LNS we need to enable L2TP server and set up method to authenticate the L2TP connection from the LAC.
```
/interface l2tp-server server
set enabled=yes
/ppp l2tp-secret
add address=10.155.101.216/32 secret=tunnelpass
```
Now the actual user authentication. In this case we will be using local authentication method for the sake of simplicity.
```
/ip pool
add name=pool0 ranges=192.168.99.2-192.168.99.99
/ppp profile
set default local-address=192.168.99.1 remote-address=pool0
/ppp secret
add name=good_worker@mt.lv password=strongpass
```
Status Check
On the LNS you can see all successfully connected clients by checking l2tp server interfaces or checking active ppp connections:
```
[admin@CHR_v6_bgp] /interface l2tp-server> print
Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic, R - running
# NAME USER MTU CLIENT-ADDRESS UPTIME ENCODING
0 DR <l2tp-... good_worker@mt.lv 1450 10.155.101.216 6h13m49s

```

# NAME SERVICE CALLER-ID ADDRESS UPTIME ENCODING
0 good_worker@mt.lv l2tp 10.155.101.216 192.168.99.2 6h15m57s
```
On the LAC we can also see active client sessions and active L2TP tunnel between LAC and LNS:
```
csrLAC#show vpdn
```
```
L2TP Tunnel and Session Information Total tunnels 1 sessions 1
```
```
LocTunID RemTunID Remote Name State Remote Address Sessn L2TP Class/

Vcid, Circuit
18521 16 26090 good_worker@mt.lv, Gi1 est 06:17:07 571
```
Session Establishment
Lets look closely on how clients sessions gets authenticated and established over the LAC.
```
Client initiates PPPoE call
LAC and Client begins LCP negotiation
after CHAP has been negotiated, LAC sends CHAP challenge
Client sends CHAP response
LAC checks whether client session should be forwarded to the LNS based on received domain name. Check can be done locally or using
RADIUS server. Client also can be authenticated here before forwarding session.
LAC brings up an L2TP tunnel
LNS checks if the LAC is allowed to open a tunnel and run the authentication process. The Tunnel is up and ready to forward VPDN sessions.
LAC forwards negotiated with the client LCP options, username and password to the LNS
LNS authenticates the client locally or using RADIUS and sends CHAP response
IP Control Protocol (IPCP) phase is performed, IP addresses and routes are installed. At this point sessions is considered established.

## Overview
The OpenVPN security model is based on SSL, the industry standard for secure communications via the internet. OpenVPN implements OSI layer 2 or 3
secure network extensions using the SSL/TLS protocol. Support IPv4, IPv6.

## Introduction
OpenVPN has been ported to various platforms, including Linux and Windows, and its configuration is likewise on each of these systems, so it makes it
easier to support and maintain. OpenVPN can run over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports, multiplexing
created SSL tunnels on a single TCP/UDP port. OpenVPN is one of the few VPN protocols that can make use of a proxy, which might be handy
sometimes.

## Limitations
Currently, noteable unsupported OpenVPN features:
```
LZO compression
```
OpenVPN username is limited to 27 characters and the password to 233 characters. Password cap increased in 7.18_ab253 to 1000 characters.

tunnel.
```
```
protocol (tcp | udp; Default: tcp) indicates the protocol to use when connecting with the remote endpoint.
```
```

hostname must be present in the server's certificate.
```
```
tls-version (any | only-1.2; Default: any) Specifies which TLS versions to allow
```
```
use-peer-dns (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to add DNS servers provided by the OVPN server to IP/DNS
configuration.
```
```
route-nopull (yes | no; Default: no) Specifies whether to allow the OVPN server to add routes to the OVPN client
instance routing table.
```
```
user (string; Default: ) User name used for authentication.
```
Also, it is possible to import the OVPN client configuration from a .ovpn configuration file. Such a file usually is provided from the OVPN server side and
already includes configuration so you need to worry only about a few parameters.
```
/interface/ovpn-client/import-ovpn-configuration ovpn-password=securepassword \
key-passphrase=certificatekeypassphrase ovpn-user=myuserid skip-cert-import=no
```
OVPN client supports tls authentication. The configuration of tls-auth can be added only by importing .ovpn configuration file. Using tls-auth requires that
you generate a shared-secret key, this key should be added to the client configuration file .ovpn.
Note* ROS client requires user name and password. Authentication is managed by server side, if its supports tls, then user name will be ignored.
```
key-direction 1
<tls-auth>
#
# 2048 bit OpenVPN static key
#
-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----
-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----
</tls-auth>
```
```
7.17beta5 added support to allow non-null auth in gcm mode.
```
Tls-crypt, tls-crypt v2
To improve TLS auth, Tls-crypt is added in version 7.17rc3.
Tls-crypt, tls-crypt v2 is suppoorted only for ovpn client with following settings:
“auth SHA256” and no key-direction in server configuration,
“auth SHA256” and “key-direction 1” in client configuration is needed for authentication to work.
Example configuration files:
client-1.ovpn
server-1.conf
OVPN Server
```
/interface ovpn-server
```
An interface is created for each tunnel established to the given server. There are two types of interfaces in the OVPN server's configuration
```
Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall rules or elsewhere) created for
the particular user.
Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and its username does not match any existing static entry
(or in case the entry is active already, as there can not be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same name).
```
Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that use
in router configuration (for example, in the firewall), so if you need a persistent rule for that user, create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to
use dynamic configuration.

```
```
def1 – Use this flag to override the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 rather
than 0.0.0.0/0. This has the benefit of overriding but not wiping out the original default gateway.
disabled - Do not send redirect-gateway flags to the OVPN client.
ipv6 - Redirect IPv6 routing into the tunnel on the client side. This works similarly to the def1
flag, that is, more specific IPv6 routes are added (2000::/4 and 3000::/4), covering the whole
IPv6 unicast space.

Also, it is possible to prepare a .ovpn file for the OVPN client which can be easily imported on the end device.
```
/interface/ovpn-server/server/export-client-configuration ca-certificate=myCa.crt \
client-certificate=client1.crt client-cert-key=client1.key server-address=192.168.88.1
server=myServerName
```
Example
Setup Overview
```
It is very important that the date on the router is within the range of the installed certificate's date of expiration. To overcome any certificate
verification problems, enable NTP date synchronization on both the server and the client.
```
Assume that Office public IP address is 2.2.2.2 and we want two remote OVPN clients to have access to 10.5.8.20 and 192.168.55.0/24 networks behind
the office gateway.
Creating Certificates
All certificates can be created on the RouterOS server using the certificate manager. See example >>.
For the simplest setup, you need only an OVPN server certificate.
Server Config
The first step is to create an IP pool from which client addresses will be assigned and some users.
```
/ip pool add name=ovpn-pool range=192.168.77.2-192.168.77.254
```
```
/ppp profile add name=ovpn local-address=192.168.77.1 remote-address=ovpn-pool
/ppp secret
add name=client1 password=123 profile=ovpn
add name=client2 password=234 profile=ovpn
```
Assume that the server certificate is already created and named "server"
```
/interface ovpn-server server add disabled=no certificate=server name=myServer
```
Client Config
Add manually which networks you want to access over the tunnel.
```
/interface ovpn-client
add name=ovpn-client1 connect-to=2.2.2.2 user=client1 password=123 disabled=no
/ip route
add dst-address=10.5.8.20 gateway=ovpn-client1
add dst-address=192.168.55.0/24 gateway=ovpn-client1
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ovpn-client1
```
Push Route
Push route support are added in 7.14, the maximum of possible input is limited to 1400 characters.
example: route network/IP [netmask] [gateway] [metric].
```
/interface ovpn-server server set myServer push-routes="192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.109.1 9"
```
VRF support
Support starting from 7.17 version is added, and couple changes introduced in configuration, if you use latest version, please refer to this example:
Server side configuration:
```
/interface ovpn-server server
add disabled=no certificate=yourcert auth=sha1 cipher=aes128-cbc require-client-certificate=yes
protocol=tcp name=ovpn-server1 vrf=main
```

## Overview
Point to Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) is simply a method of encapsulating PPP packets into Ethernet frames. PPPoE is an extension of the standard Point
to Point Protocol (PPP) and it the successor of PPPoA. PPPoE standard is defined in RFC 2516. The PPPoE client and server work over any Layer2
Ethernet level interface on the router, for example, Wireless, Ethernet, EoIP, etc. Generally speaking, PPPoE is used to hand out IP addresses to clients
based on authentication by username (and also if required, by workstation) as opposed to workstation only authentication where static IP addresses or
DHCP are used. It is advised not to use static IP addresses or DHCP on the same interfaces as PPPoE for obvious security reasons.

## Introduction
PPPoE provides the ability to connect a network of hosts over a simple bridging access device to a remote Access Concentrator.
Supported connections:
```
MikroTik RouterOS PPPoE client to any PPPoE server;
MikroTik RouterOS server (access concentrator) to multiple PPPoE clients (clients are available for almost all operating systems and most
routers);
```

## PPPoE Operation
PPPoE has two distinct stages(phases):
```
Discovery phase;
Session phase;
```

## Discovery phase
There are four steps to the Discovery stage. When it completes, both peers know the PPPoE SESSION_ID and the peer's Ethernet address, which
together define the PPPoE session uniquely:
```
PPPoE Active Discovery Initialization (PADI) - The PPPoE client sends out a PADI packet to the broadcast address. This packet can also
populate the "service-name" field if a service name has been entered in the dial-up networking properties of the PPPoE client. If a service name
has not been entered, this field is not populated
PPPoE Active Discovery Offer (PADO) - The PPPoE server, or Access Concentrator, should respond to the PADI with a PADO if the Access
Concentrator is able to service the "service-name" field that had been listed in the PADI packet. If no "service-name" field had been listed, the
Access Concentrator will respond with a PADO packet that has the "service-name" field populated with the service names that the Access
Concentrator can service. The PADO packet is sent to the unicast address of the PPPoE client
PPPoE Active Discovery Request (PADR) - When a PADO packet is received, the PPPoE client responds with a PADR packet. This packet is
sent to the unicast address of the Access Concentrator. The client may receive multiple PADO packets, but the client responds to the first valid PA
```
```

```

```
```

```
```
DO that the client received. If the initial PADI packet had a blank "service-name" field filed, the client populates the "service-name" field of the PADR
packet with the first service name that had been returned in the PADO packet.
PPPoE Active Discovery Session Confirmation (PADS) - When the PADR is received, the Access Concentrator generates a unique session
identification (ID) for the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) session and returns this ID to the PPPoE client in the PADS packet. This packet is sent to
the unicast address of the client.
```
PPPoE session termination:
```
PPPoE Active Discovery Terminate (PADT) - Can be sent anytime after a session is established to indicate that a PPPoE session terminated. It
can be sent by either server or client.
```
Session phase
When the discovery stage is completed, both peers know PPPoE Session ID and other peer's Ethernet (MAC) address which together defines the PPPoE
session. PPP frames are encapsulated in PPPoE session frames, which have Ethernet frame type 0x8864.
When a server sends confirmation and a client receives it, PPP Session is started that consists of the following stages:
```
LCP negotiation stage
Authentication (CHAP/PAP) stage
IPCP negotiation stage - where the client is assigned an IP address.
```
PPPoE server sends Echo-Request packets to the client to determine the state of the session, otherwise, the server will not be able to determine that
session is terminated in cases when a client terminates session without sending Terminate-Request packet.
MTU
Typically, the largest Ethernet frame that can be transmitted without fragmentation is 1500 bytes. PPPoE adds another 6 bytes of overhead and the PPP
field adds two more bytes, leaving 1492 bytes for IP datagram. Therefore max PPPoE MRU and MTU values must not be larger than 1492.
TCP stacks try to avoid fragmentation, so they use an MSS (Maximum Segment Size). By default, MSS is chosen as MTU of the outgoing interface minus
the usual size of the TCP and IP headers (40 bytes), which results in 1460 bytes for an Ethernet interface. Unfortunately, there may be intermediate links
with lower MTU which will cause fragmentation. In such a case TCP stack performs path MTU discovery. Routers that cannot forward the datagram without
fragmentation are supposed to drop the packet and send ICMP-Fragmentation-Required to originating host. When a host receives such an ICMP packet, it
tries to lower the MTU. This should work in the ideal world, however in the real world many routers do not generate fragmentation-required datagrams, also
many firewalls drop all ICMP datagrams.
The workaround for this problem is to adjust MSS if it is too big.

## PPPoE Server
There are two types of interface (tunnel) items in PPPoE server configuration - static users and dynamic connections. An interface is created for each
tunnel established to the given server. Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall
rules or elsewhere) created for the particular user. Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and its username
does not match any existing static entry (or in case the entry is active already, as there can not be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same
name - set one-session-per-host value if this is a problem). Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so
it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that use in router configuration (for example, in firewall), so if you need a persistent rule for that user,
create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to use a dynamic configuration.


# Access concentrator

Property Description
```
```
authentication ( mschap2

mschap1, chap, pap")
```
```
Authentication algorithm
```
```
default-profile (string;
Default: "default")
```
```
interface (string; Default:
"")
```
```
Interface that the clients are connected to
```
```
keepalive-timeout (time;
Default: "10")
```
```
Defines the time period (in seconds) after which the router is starting to send keepalive packets every second. If there is no
traffic and no keepalive responses arrive for that period of time (i.e. 2 * keepalive-timeout), the non responding client is
proclaimed disconnected.
```
```
max-mru (integer;
Default: "1480")
```
```
Maximum Receive Unit. The optimal value is the MTU of the interface the tunnel is working over reduced by 20 (so, for
1500-byte Ethernet link, set the MTU to 1480 to avoid fragmentation of packets)
```
```
max-mtu (integer;
Default: "1480")
```
```
Maximum Transmission Unit. The optimal value is the MTU of the interface the tunnel is working over reduced by 20 (so, for
1500-byte Ethernet link, set the MTU to 1480 to avoid fragmentation of packets)
```
```
For Windows, some connection instructions may use the form where the "phone number", such as "MikroTik_AC\mt1", is specified to indicate
that "MikroTik_AC" is the access concentrator name and "mt1" is the service name.
```
```
Specifying MRRU means enabling MP (Multilink PPP) over a single link. This protocol is used to split big packets into smaller ones. Under
Windows, it can be enabled in the Networking tab, Settings button, "Negotiate multi-link for single link connections". MRRU is hardcoded to
1614 on Windows. This setting is useful to overcome PathMTU discovery failures. The MP setting should be enabled on both peers.
```
```
In both cases PPP users must be configured properly - static entries do not replace PPP configuration.
```
```
max-sessions (integer;
Default: "0")
```
```
Maximum number of clients that the AC can serve. '0' = no limitations.
```
```
mrru (integer: 512..
65535 | disabled;
Default: "disabled")
```
```
Maximum packet size that can be received on the link. If a packet is bigger than tunnel MTU, it will be split into multiple
packets, allowing full size IP or Ethernet packets to be sent over the tunnel.
```
```
one-session-per-host (ye
s | no; Default: "no")
```
```
Allow only one session per host (determined by MAC address). If a host tries to establish a new session, the old one will be
closed.
```
```
pppoe-over-vlan-range (i
nteger 1..4094; Default: "")
```
```
This setting allows a PPPoE server to operate over 802.1Q VLANs. By default, a PPPoE server only accepts untagged
packets on its interface. However, in scenarios where clients are on separate VLANs, instead of creating multiple 802.1Q
VLAN interfaces and bridging them together or configuring individual PPPoE servers for each VLAN, you can specify the
necessary VLANs directly in the PPPoE server settings.
```
```
When you specify the VLAN IDs, the PPPoE server will accept both untagged packets and 802.1Q tagged packets from
clients, and it will reply using the same VLAN. This setting can also be applied to both CVLAN and SVLAN interfaces. For
example, when the use-service-tag=yes option is used on a VLAN interface, enabling QinQ setups as well.
```
```
The setting supports a range of VLAN IDs, as well as individual VLANs specified using comma-separated values. For
example: pppoe-over-vlan-range=100-115,120,122,128-130.
```
```
service-name (string;
Default: "")
```
```
The PPPoE service name. Server will accept clients which sends PADI message with service-names that matches this
setting or if service-name field in PADI message is not set.
```
The PPPoE server (access concentrator) supports multiple servers for each interface - with differing service names. The access concentrator name and
PPPoE service name are used by clients to identify the access concentrator to register with. The access concentrator name is the same as the identity of
the router displayed before the command prompt. The identity may be set within the /system identity submenu.
Specifying MRRU means enabling MP (Multilink PPP) over a single link. This protocol is used to split big packets into smaller ones.  Their MRRU is
hardcoded to 1614. This setting is useful to overcome PathMTU discovery failures. The MP setting should be enabled on both peers.
Quick Example
PPPoE Client
To configure MikroTik RouterOS to be a PPPoE client, just add a PPPoE-client with the following parameters as in the example:
```
Do not assign an IP address to the interface you will be receiving the PPPoE requests on.
```
```
The default keepalive-timeout value of 10s is OK in most cases. If you set it to 0, the router will not disconnect clients until they explicitly log out
or the router is restarted. To resolve this problem, the one-session-per-host property can be used.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pppoe-client add interface=ether2 password=StrongPass service-name=pppoeservice

```
PPPoE Server
To configure MikroTik RouterOS to be an Access Concentrator (PPPoE Server):
```
add an IP address pool for the clients from 10.0.0.2-10.0.0.5;
add PPP profile;
add PPP secret (username/password);
add the PPPoE server itself;
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip pool

# IPv6 PD over PPP
```
Summary
Configuration

Client
Testing status
```

## Summary
This example demonstrates how to set up PPPoE server and client to use IPv6 Prefix Delegation.
IPv6 Prefixes can be delegated over PPP interfaces. When client connects, PPP will automatically add dynamic DHCPv6-PD server. This allows to run
DHCPv6 client on PPP interfaces.

## Configuration

## Server
dhcpv6-pd-pool parameter under PPP Profiles is used to enable PPP-PD. PPP will use specified IPv6 pool to create a dynamic DHCP server.
So first step is to add IPv6 pool:
```
/ipv6 pool
add name=myPool prefix=2001:db8:7501:ff00::/60 prefix-length=62
```
Now we can configure PPP profile and add PPPoE server
```
/ppp profile set default dhcpv6-pd-pool=myPool
```
```
/interface pppoe-server server
add service-name=test interface=ether1
```

## Client
On client side we need to set up PPPoE client interface and run DHCP client on it.
```
/interface pppoe-client
add name=client-test interface=ether1 user=a1 service-name=test
```
```
/ipv6 dhcp-client
add interface=client-test pool-name=ppp-test pool-prefix-length=64
```

## Testing status
On server side check if dynamic DHCP server is added and prefix is bound to specific client:
```
[admin@RB1100] /ipv6 dhcp-server> print
Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, I - invalid

# MLPPP over single and multiple links

Summary
MLPPP over single link
Configuration Example
MLPPP over multiple links
Configuration Example
```

## Summary
Standards: RFC 1990
Multi-Link Point to Point Protocol (MP, Multi-Link PPP, MultiPPP or MLPPP) is a method of splitting, recombining, and sequencing data across multiple
logical data links.
In a situation where we have multiple DSL links a pair of devices, performance by “widening the pipe” between two devices can be increased by using
Multi-Link PPP, without going to a newer, more expensive technology.
Large packets are actually split into bits and sent evenly over ALL logical data links. This is done instantaneously with NO loss of bandwidth. It is important
to understand that other end of the link needs to use the same protocol to recombine your data.
Multilink is based on an LCP option negotiation that allows to indicate to its peer that it is capable of combining multiple physical links.

## MLPPP over single link
Typically size of the packet sent over PPP link is reduced due to overhead. MP can be used to transmit and receive full frame over single ppp link. To
make it work the Multilink Protocol uses additional LCP configuration options Multilink Maximum Received Reconstructed Unit (MRRU)
To enable Multi-link PPP over single link you must specify MRRU (Maximum Receive Reconstructed Unit) option. If both sides support this feature there
are no need for MSS adjustment (in firewall mangle). Study shows that MRRU is less CPU expensive that 2 mangle rules per client. MRRU allows to divide
packet to multiple channels therefore increasing possible MTU and MRU (up to 65535 bytes)
Under Windows it can be enabled in Networking tag, Settings button, "Negotiate multi-link for single link connections". Their MRRU is hard coded to 1614.

## Configuration Example
Let's configure pppoe server compatible with Windows clients and MRRU enabled.
```
[admin@RB800] /interface pppoe-server server> add service-name=myPPP interface=ether1 mrru=1614
[admin@RB800] /interface pppoe-server server> print
Flags: X - disabled
0 service-name="myPPP" interface=ether1 max-mtu=1480 max-mru=1480 mrru=1614
authentication=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2 keepalive-timeout=10 one-session-per-host=no
max-sessions=0 default-profile=default
```
In short - standard PPP link - just specify MRRU in both sides.

## MLPPP over multiple links
MLPPP over multiple links allow to create a single PPP link over multiple physical connections. All PPP links must come from the same server (server
must have MLPPP over multiple links support) and all PPP links must have same user name and password.
And to enable MLPPP you just need to create PPP client and specify multiple interfaces instead of single interface. RouterOS has MLPPP client support
only. Presently there are no MLPPP server support available.
```
MTU will be reduced by 4 bytes to work properly when MPPE encryption is enabled
```
Configuration Example
ISP gives to its client two physical links (DSL lines) 1Mbps each. To get aggregated 2Mbps pipe we have to set up MLPPP. Consider ISP router is pre-
configured to support MLPPP.
Configuration on router (R1) is:
```
/interface pppoe-client
add service-name=ISP interface=ether1,ether2 user=xxx password=yyy disabled=no \
add-default-route=yes use-peer-dns=yes
```
```
[admin@RB800] /interface pppoe-client> print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
0 name="pppoe-out1" max-mtu=1480 max-mru=1480 mrru=disabled interface=ether1,ether2
user="xxx" password="yyy" profile=default service-name="ISP" ac-name="" add-default-route=yes
dial-on-demand=no use-peer-dns=yes allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```
Now when PPPoE client is connected we can set up rest of configuration, local network address, enable DNS requests, set up masquerade and firewall
```
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=local
```
```
/ip dns set allow-remote-request=yes
```
```
/ip firewall nat
add chain=src-nat action=masquerade out-interface=pppoe-out1
```
```
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop \
comment="Drop Invalid connections"
add chain=input connection-state=established action=accept \
comment="Allow Established connections"
add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept \
comment="Allow ICMP"
add chain=input src-address=192.168.88.0/24 action=accept \
in-interface=!pppoe-out1
add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop everything else"
```

# PPTP

## Overview
PPTP has many known security issues and we do not recommend using it. However, this protocol is integrated into common operating systems, and it is
easy to set it up. PPTP can be useful in networks where security is not of concern.
IPv6 is not supported on this protocol.
PPTP traffic uses TCP port 1723 and IP protocol GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation, IP protocol ID 47), as assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). PPTP can be used with most firewalls and routers by enabling traffic destined for TCP port 1723 and protocol 47 traffic to be routed
through the firewall or router.  PPTP includes PPP authentication and accounting for each PPTP connection. Full authentication and accounting of each
connection may be done through a RADIUS client or locally.

## PPTP Client

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
add-default-route (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to add PPTP remote address as a default route.

```
```
dial-on-demand (yes | no; Default: no) connects to PPTP server only when outbound traffic is generated. If selected, then route with gateway
address from 10.112.112.0/24 network will be added while connection is not established.
```

```

## PPTP Server
```
/interface pptp-server
```
An interface is created for each tunnel established to the given server. There are two types of interfaces in the PPTP server's configuration:
```
Static interfaces are added administratively if there is a need to reference the particular interface name (in firewall rules or elsewhere) created for
the particular user;
Dynamic interfaces are added to this list automatically whenever a user is connected and its username does not match any existing static entry
(or in case the entry is active already, as there can not be two separate tunnel interfaces referenced by the same name);
```
Dynamic interfaces appear when a user connects and disappear once the user disconnects, so it is impossible to reference the tunnel created for that use
in router configuration (for example, in firewall), so if you need persistent rules for that user, create a static entry for him/her. Otherwise, it is safe to use a
dynamic configuration.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```

the server does not receives response from the client, then disconnect after 5 seconds. Logs will show 5x "LCP
missed echo reply" messages and then disconnect.
```
```
max-mru (integer; Default: 1450

multiple packets, allowing full size IP or Ethernet packets to be sent over the tunnel.
```
Example
PPTP Client
The following example demonstrates how to set up a PPTP client with username "MT-User", password "StrongPass" and server 192.168.62.2:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pptp-client add connect-to=192.168.62.2 disabled=no name=pptp-out1
password=StrongPass user=MT-User
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pptp-client print
Flags: X - disabled; R - running
```
```
In both cases PPP users must be configured properly - static entries do not replace PPP configuration.
```
```

password="StrongPass" profile=default-encryption keepalive-timeout=60 add-default-route=no
dial-on-demand=no allow=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
```
PPTP Server
On the other side we simply enable the PPTP server and create a PPP secret for a particular user:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface pptp-server server set enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > ppp secret add local-address=10.0.0.1 name=MT-User password=StrongPass profile=default-

## Overview
Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) transports a PPP tunnel over a TLS channel. The use of TLS over TCP port 443 allows SSTP to pass through
virtually all firewalls and proxy servers.

## Introduction
Let's take a look at the SSTP connection mechanism:
```
A TCP connection is established from client to server (by default on port 443);
SSL validates the server certificate. If a certificate is valid, a connection is established otherwise the connection is turned down. (But see note
below);
The client sends SSTP control packets within the HTTPS session which establishes the SSTP state machine on both sides;
PPP negotiation over SSTP. The client authenticates to the server and binds IP addresses to the SSTP interface;
```
SSTP tunnel is now established and packet encapsulation can begin;
```
Starting from v5.0beta2 SSTP does not require certificates to operate and can use any available authentication type. This feature will work only
between two MikroTik routers, as it is not in accordance with Microsoft standards. Otherwise to establish secure tunnels mschap authentication
and client/server certificates from the same chain should be used.

```
Certificates
To set up a secure SSTP tunnel, certificates are required. On the server, authentication is done only by username and password, but on the client - the
server is authenticated using a server certificate. It is also used by the client to cryptographically bind SSL and PPP authentication, meaning - the clients
send a special value over SSTP connection to the server, this value is derived from the key data that is generated during PPP authentication and server
certificate, this allows the server to check if both channels are secure.
If SSTP clients are on Windows PCs then the only way to set up a secure SSTP tunnel when using a self-signed certificate is by importing the "server"
certificate on the SSTP server and on the Windows PC adding a CA certificate in the trusted root.
A similar configuration on RouterOS client would be to import the CA certificate and enabling the verify-server-certificate option. In this scenario, Man-in-
the-Middle attacks are not possible.
Between two Mikrotik routers, it is also possible to set up an insecure tunnel by not using certificates at all. In this case, data going through the SSTP
tunnel is using anonymous DH and Man-in-the-Middle attacks are easily accomplished. This scenario is not compatible with Windows clients.
It is also possible to make a secure SSTP tunnel by adding additional authorization with a client certificate. Configuration requirements are:
```
certificates on both server and client
verification options enabled on server and client
```
This scenario is also not possible with Windows clients, because there is no way to set up a client certificate on Windows.
Certificate Error Messages
When SSL handshake fails, you will see one of the following certificate errors:
```
certificate is not yet valid - notBefore certificate date is after the current time;
certificate has expired - certificate expiry date is before the current time;
cinvalid certificate purpose - the supplied certificate cannot be used for the specified purpose;
cself signed certificate in a chain - the certificate chain could be built up using the untrusted certificates but the root could not be found locally;
cunable to get issuer certificate locally - CA certificate is not imported locally;
cserver's IP address does not match certificate - server address verification is enabled, but the address provided in certificate does not match the
server's address;
```
Quick Example
SSTP Client
In the following configuration example, e will create a simple SSTP client without using a certificate:
```
[admin@MikroTik > interface sstp-client add connect-to=192.168.62.2 disabled=no name=sstp-out1
password=StrongPass profile=default-encryption user=MT-User
[admin@MikroTik > interface sstp-client print
Flags: X - disabled; R - running
0 R name="sstp-out1" max-mtu=1500 max-mru=1500 mrru=disabled connect-to=192.168.62.2:443
http-proxy=0.0.0.0:443 certificate=none verify-server-certificate=no
verify-server-address-from-certificate=yes user="MT-User" password="StrongPass"
profile=default-encryption keepalive-timeout=60 add-default-route=no dial-on-demand=no
authentication=pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2 pfs=no tls-version=any
```
```
If your server certificate is issued by a CA which is already known by Windows, then the Windows client will work without any additional
certificate imports to a trusted root.
```
```
RSA key length must be at least 472 bits if a certificate is used by SSTP. Shorter keys are considered as security threats.
```
SSTP Server
We will configure PPP secret for a particular user, afterwards simply enable an SSTP server:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ppp secret add local-address=10.0.0.1 name=MT-User password=StrongPass remote-address=10.
0.0.5 service=sstp
[admin@MikroTik] > interface sstp-server server set default-profile=default-encryption enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] > interface sstp-server server print
enabled: yes
port: 443
max-mtu: 1500
max-mru: 1500
mrru: disabled
keepalive-timeout: 60
default-profile: default-encryption
authentication: pap,chap,mschap1,mschap2
certificate: none
verify-client-certificate: no
pfs: no
tls-version: any
```
```
In P2P setups network address will be same with other endpoint local address.
```
```
As with any other ppp tunnel, SSTP also supports BCP which allows it to bridge SSTP tunnel with a local interface. For example in setups
where routers are connected to Internet through ether1, workstations and laptops are connected to ether2. Both local networks are routed
through SSTP client, and they are not in the same broadcast domain BCP is used.

WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more
useful than IPsec while avoiding massive headaches. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general-
purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it
is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable.

```
List of IP (v4 or v6) addresses with CIDR masks from which incoming traffic for this peer is allowed and to which outgoing traffic for this
peer is directed. This IP address has to be in the same subnet as WireGuard interface set on ROS. If WireGuard interface is at
192.168.99.1/24, You have to input 192.168.99.2 to the client. By adding this IP under 'Allowed Address', you are saying that only this
specific client (phone for example) is permitted to connect to this peer configuration. Allowed-address range cannot overlap on one
interface, so you need to set own range for each peer.

The local port upon which this WireGuard tunnel will listen for incoming traffic from peers, and the port from which it will source outgoing
packets.
```
```
name (stri
ng;
Default: )
```
```
Allows adding name to a peer. Name will be used as a reference for a peer in WireGuard logs. (Available from RouterOS version 7.15)
```
```
responder
(yes | no;
Default: no
)
```
```
Specifies if peer is intended to be connection initiator or only responder. Should be used on WireGuard devices that are used as "servers"
for other devices as clients to connect to. Otherwise router will all repeatedly try to connect "endpoint-address" or "current-endpoint-
address".
```
*AllowedIPs  configuration that is provided to the client through WireGuard peer export (configuration file or QR code) can not be changed and will be
"0.0.0.0/0, ::/0" at the moment. If it is necessary to change these values on remote end, then that is up to the remote peer software used for WireGuard
connection.

Application examples
Site to Site WireGuard tunnel
Consider setup as illustrated below. Two remote office routers are connected to the internet and office workstations are behind NAT. Each office has its
own local subnet, 10.1.202.0/24 for Office1 and 10.1.101.0/24 for Office2. Both remote offices need secure tunnels to local networks behind routers.
WireGuard interface configuration
First of all, WireGuard interfaces must be configured on both sites to allow automatic private and public key generation. The command is the same for both
routers:
```
/interface/wireguard
add listen-port=13231 name=wireguard1
```
Now when printing the interface details, both private and public keys should be visible to allow an exchange.
Office1
```
When you encounter issues with reply traffic having the wrong source address, using NAT to translate packet source addresses to your
loopback interface is a common workaround. This approach helps ensure that the source address is consistent and correct when packets are
routed back through the network.
```
```
Any private key will never be needed on the remote side device - hence the name private.
```
```
/interface/wireguard print
Flags: X - disabled; R - running
0 R name="wireguard1" mtu=1420 listen-port=13231 private-key="yKt9NJ4e5qlaSgh48WnPCDCEkDmq+VsBTt/DDEBWfEo="
public-key="u7gYAg5tkioJDcm3hyS7pm79eADKPs/ZUGON6/fF3iI="
```
Office2
```
/interface/wireguard/print
Flags: X - disabled; R - running
0 R name="wireguard1" mtu=1420 listen-port=13231 private-key="KMwxqe/iXAU8Jn9dd1o5pPdHep2blGxNWm9I944/I24="
public-key="v/oIzPyFm1FPHrqhytZgsKjU7mUToQHLrW+Tb5e601M="
```
Peer configuration
Peer configuration defines who can use the WireGuard interface and what kind of traffic can be sent over it. To identify the remote peer, its public key must
be specified together with the created WireGuard interface.
Office1
```
/interface/wireguard/peers
add allowed-address=10.1.101.0/24,10.255.255.1/32 endpoint-address=192.168.80.1 endpoint-port=13231
interface=wireguard1 \
public-key="v/oIzPyFm1FPHrqhytZgsKjU7mUToQHLrW+Tb5e601M="
```
Office2
```
/interface/wireguard/peers
add allowed-address=10.1.202.0/24,10.255.255.2/32 endpoint-address=192.168.90.1 endpoint-port=13231
interface=wireguard1 \
public-key="u7gYAg5tkioJDcm3hyS7pm79eADKPs/ZUGON6/fF3iI="
```
IP and routing configuration
Lastly, IP and routing information must be configured to allow traffic to be sent over the tunnel.
Office1
```
/ip/address
add address=10.255.255.1/30 interface=wireguard1
/ip/route
add dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 gateway=wireguard1
```
Office2
```
/ip/address
add address=10.255.255.2/30 interface=wireguard1
/ip/route
add dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 gateway=wireguard1
```
Firewall considerations
The default RouterOS firewall will block the tunnel from establishing properly. The traffic should be accepted in the "input" chain before any drop rules on
both sites.
Office1
```
/ip/firewall/filter
add action=accept chain=input dst-port=13231 protocol=udp src-address=192.168.80.1
```
Office2
```
/ip/firewall/filter
add action=accept chain=input dst-port=13231 protocol=udp src-address=192.168.90.1
```
Additionally, it is possible that the "forward" chain restricts the communication between the subnets as well, so such traffic should be accepted before any
drop rules as well.
Office1
```
/ip/firewall/filter
add action=accept chain=forward dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 src-address=10.1.101.0/24
add action=accept chain=forward dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 src-address=10.1.202.0/24
```
Office2
```
/ip/firewall/filter
add action=accept chain=forward dst-address=10.1.101.0/24 src-address=10.1.202.0/24
add action=accept chain=forward dst-address=10.1.202.0/24 src-address=10.1.101.0/24
```
RoadWarrior WireGuard tunnel
RouterOS configuration
Add a new WireGuard interface and assign an IP address to it.
```
/interface wireguard
add listen-port=13231 name=wireguard1
/ip address
add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=wireguard1
```
Adding a new WireGuard interface will automatically generate a pair of private and public keys. You will need to configure the public key on your remote
devices. To obtain the public key value, simply print out the interface details.
```
[admin@home] > /interface wireguard print
Flags: X - disabled; R - running
0 R name="wireguard1" mtu=1420 listen-port=13231 private-key="cBPD6JNvbEQr73gJ7NmwepSrSPK3np381AWGvBk/QkU="
public-key="VmGMh+cwPdb8//NOhuf1i1VIThypkMQrKAO9Y55ghG8="
```
For the next steps, you will need to figure out the public key of the remote device. Once you have it, add a new peer by specifying the public key of the
remote device and allowed addresses that will be allowed over the WireGuard tunnel.
```
/interface wireguard peers
add allowed-address=192.168.100.2/32 interface=wireguard1 public-key="<paste public key from remote device
here>"
```
Firewall considerations
If you have default or strict firewall configured, you need to allow remote device to establish the WireGuard connection to your device.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="allow WireGuard" dst-port=13231 protocol=udp place-before=1
```
To allow remote devices to connect to the RouterOS services (e.g. request DNS), allow the WireGuard subnet in input chain.
```
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=input comment="allow WireGuard traffic" src-address=192.168.100.0/24 place-before=1
```
Or simply add the WireGuard interface to "LAN" interface list.
```
/interface list member
add interface=wireguard1 list=LAN
```
iOS configuration
Download the WireGuard application from the App Store. Open it up and create a new configuration from scratch.
First of all give your connection a "Name" and choose to generate a keypair. The generated public key is necessary for peer's configuration on RouterOS
side.
Specify an IP address in "Addresses" field that is in the same subnet as configured on the server side. This address will be used for communication. For
this example, we used 192.168.100.1/24 on the RouterOS side, you can use 192.168.100.2 here.
If necessary, configure the DNS servers. If allow-remote-requests is set to yes under IP/DNS section on the RouterOS side, you can specify the remote
WireGuard IP address here.
Click "Add peer" which reveals more parameters.
The "Public key" value is the public key value that is generated on the WireGuard interface on RouterOS side.
"Endpoint" is the IP or DNS with port number of the RouterOS device that the iOS device can communicate with over the Internet.
"Allowed IPs" are set to 0.0.0.0/0 to allow all traffic to be sent over the WireGuard tunnel.
```
Depending on your configuration, you may need to add a NAT rule
chain=dstnat action=dst-nat to-ports=port protocol=udp in-interface=interface dst-port=port
```
Windows 10 configuration
Download WireGuard installer from Wireguard
Run as Administrator.
Press Ctrl+n to add new empty tunnel, add name for interface, Public key should be auto generated copy it to RouterOS peer configuration.
Add to server configuration, so full configuration looks like this (keep your auto generated PrivateKey in [Interface] section:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = your_autogenerated_private_key=
Address = 192.168.100.2/24
DNS = 192.168.100.1
```
```

## Introduction
The ZeroTier network hypervisor is a self-contained network virtualization engine that implements an Ethernet virtualization layer similar to VXLAN built
atop a cryptographically secure global peer-to-peer network. It provides advanced network virtualization and management capabilities on par with an
enterprise SDN switch, but across both local and wide area networks and connecting almost any kind of app or device.
MikroTik has added ZeroTier to RouterOS v7.1rc2 as a separate package for the ARM/ARM64 architecture.
Zerotier has been upgraded to 1.14.0 on 7.17rc6 ROS version.
Wait, so what can I use it for?
```
Hosting a game server at home (useful for LAN only games) or simply creating a LAN party with your friends;
Accessing LAN devices behind NAT directly;
Accessing LAN devices via SSH without opening port to the Internet;
Using your local Pi-Hole setup from anywhere via the Internet;
```

## Video tutorial
```
ZeroTier
```

## Required Network Configuration

## What ports does ZeroTier use?
It listens on three 3 UDP ports:
```
9993 - The default
A random, high numbered port derived from your ZeroTier address
A random, high numbered port for use with UPnP/NAT-PMP mappings
```
That means your peers could be listening on any port. To talk with them directly, you need to be able to send them to any port.

## Recommended Local Network and Internet Gateway Configuration
These ZeroTier recommended guidelines are consistent with the vast majority of typical deployments using commodity gateways and access points:
```
Don't restrict outbound UDP traffic.
Supporting either UPnP or NAT-PMP on your network can greatly improve performance by allowing ZeroTier endpoints to map external ports and
avoid NAT traversal entirely.
```

### 1.

### 2.
```
IPv6 is recommended and can greatly improve direct connection reliability if supported on both ends of a direct link. If present it should be
implemented without NAT (NAT is wholly unnecessary with IPv6 and only adds complexity) and with a stateful firewall that permits bidirectional
UDP conversations.
Don't use "symmetric" NAT. Use "full cone" or "port restricted cone" NAT. Symmetric NAT is extremely hostile to peer-to-peer traffic and will
degrade VoIP, video chat, games, WebRTC, and many other protocols as well as ZeroTier.
No more than one layer of NAT should be present between ZeroTier endpoints and the Internet. Multiple layers of NAT introduce connection
instability due to chaotic interactions between states and behaviors at different levels. No Double NAT.
NATs should have a port mapping or connection timeout no shorter than 60 seconds.
Place no more than about 16,000 devices behind each NAT-managed external IP address to ensure that each device can map a sufficient
number of ports.
Switches and wireless access points should allow direct local traffic between local devices. Turn off any "local isolation" features. Some switches
might allow finer-grained control, and on these, it would be sufficient to allow local UDP traffic to/from 9993 (or in general).
```
Configuration example
By default, ZeroTier is designed to be zero-configuration. A user can start a new ZeroTier node without having to write configuration files or provide the IP
addresses of other nodes. It’s also designed to be fast. Any two devices in the world should be able to locate each other and communicate almost instantly
so the following example will enable ZeroTier on RouterOS device and connect one mobile phone using the ZeroTier application.
```
Register on my.zerotier.com and Create A Network, obtain the Network ID, in this example: 1d71939404912b40;
```
```

```
```

```
```
Download and Install ZeroTier NPK package in RouterOS, you can find under in the "Extra packages", upload package on the device and reboot
the unit;
Enable the default (official) ZeroTier instance:
```
```
[admin@mikrotik] > zerotier/enable zt1
```
```
Add a new network, specifying the network ID you created in the ZeroTier cloud console:
```
```
[admin@mikrotik] zerotier/interface/add network=1d71939404912b40 instance=zt1
```
```
Verify ZeroTier configuration:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > zerotier/interface/print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, MAC-ADDRESS, NETWORK, NETWORK-NAME, STATUS
# NAME MAC-ADDRESS NETWORK NETWORK-NAME STATUS
0 R zerotier1 42:AC:0D:0F:C6:F6 1d71939404912b40 modest_metcalfe OK
```
```
Now you might need to allow connections from the ZeroTier interface to your router, and optionally, to your other LAN interfaces:
```
```
/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward in-interface=zerotier1 place-before=0
/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input in-interface=zerotier1 place-before=0
```
```
Install a ZeroTier client on your smartphone or computer, follow the ZeroTier manual on how to connect to the same network from there.
If "Access Control" is set to "Private", you must authorize nodes before they become members:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip/address/print where interface~"zero"
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: ADDRESS, NETWORK, INTERFACE
# ADDRESS NETWORK INTERFACE
3 D 192.168.192.105/24 192.168.192.0 zerotier1

sent=3 received=3 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=407us avg-rtt=436us max-rtt=452us
```
Peer
```
zerotier/peer/
```
```
You should specify routes to specific internal subnets in the ZeroTier cloud console, to make sure you can access those networks when
connecting from other devices.
```
ZeroTier`s peer is an informative section with a list of nodes that your node knows about. Nodes can not talk to each other unless they are joined and
authorized on the same network.

Controller
RouterOS implements ZeroTier functionality in the role of a node where most of the network configuration must be done on the ZeroTier webpage
dashboard. However, in situations where you would prefer to do all the configuration on your own device, RouterOS offers to host your own controller
A common misunderstanding is to conflate network controllers with root servers (planet and moons). Root servers are connection facilitators that operate
at the VL1 level. Network controllers are configuration managers and certificate authorities that belong to the VL2 level. Generally, root servers don’t join or
control virtual networks and network controllers are not root servers, though it is possible to have a node do both.
```
/zerotier/controller/
```
Every ZeroTier instance has a self-hosting network controller that can be used to host virtual networks. A controller is responsible for admitting members to
the network, and issuing default configuration information including certificates. Controllers can in theory host up to 2^24 networks and serve many millions
of devices (or more), but we recommend spreading large numbers of networks across many controllers for load balancing and fault tolerance reasons.
Parameters
```
Property Description
```
```
broadcast  (
yes | no;
Default: yes)
```
```
Allow receiving broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) packets.
```
```
comment (stri
ng; Default: )
```
```
Descriptive comment for the controller.
```
```
copy-from (str
ing; Default: )
```
```
Copies an existing item. It takes default values of a new item's properties from another item. If you do not want to make an exact copy,
you can specify new values for some properties. When copying items that have names, you will usually have to give a new name to a
copy.
```
```
instance (string
; Default: zt1)
```
```
ZeroTier instance name.
```
```
ip-range (IP;

```
```
ip6-6plane (
yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
An option gives every member a /80 within a /40 network but uses NDP emulation to route all IPs under that /80 to their owner. The 6pl
ane mode is great for use cases like Docker since it allows every member to assign IPv6 addresses within its /80 that just work
instantly and globally across the network.
```

```
Configuration example
In the following example, we will use RouterOS built-in ZeroTier controller to send our new network hosts appropriate certificates, credentials, and
configuration information. The controller will operate from the "RouterOS Home" device and we will join in our network 3 units: mobile phone, laptop,
RouterOS Office device, but theoretically, you can join up to 100 devices in one network.
RouterOS Home
First, we enable the default instance which operates at the VL1 level :
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> print
Columns: NAME, PORT, IDENTITY.PUBLIC
# NAME PORT IDENTITY.
PUBLIC
```
```
;;; ZeroTier Central controller - https://my.zerotier.com/
0 zt1 9993 879c0b5265:0:
d5fd2d17805e011d9b93ce8779385e427c8f405e520eea9284809d8444de0335a817xxb21aa4ba153bfbc229ca34d94e08de96d925a4aaa1
9b252da546693a28
```
Now we create a new network via the controller section which will operate at the VL2 level. Each network has its own controller and each network ID is
generated from the controller address and controller ID combination.
Note that we use the private=yes option for a more secure network:
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> controller/add name=ZT-private instance=zt1 ip-range=172.27.27.10-172.27.27.20
private=yes routes=172.27.27.0/24
[admin@Home] /zerotier> controller/print
Columns: INSTANCE, NAME, NETWORK, PRIVATE
# INSTANCE NAME NETWORK PRIVATE
0 zt1 ZT-private 879c0b5265a99e4b yes
```
Add our new network under the interface section:
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> interface/add network=879c0b5265a99e4b name=myZeroTier instance=zt1
[admin@Home] /zerotier> interface/print interval=1
Columns: NAME, MAC-ADDRESS, NETWORK, STATUS
# NAME MAC-ADDRESS NETWORK STATUS
0 myZeroTier 4A:19:35:6E:00:6E 879c0b5265a99e4b ACCESS_DENIED
```
Each new peer asks for a controller to join the network, in this situation, we have ACCESS_DENIED status and we have to authorize a new peer, that is
because we used the private=yes option.
After authorization, each member in the network receives information from the controller about new peers and approval they can exchange packets with
them:
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> controller/member/print
Columns: NETWORK, ZT-ADDRESS
# NETWORK ZT-ADDRESS
0 ZT-private 879a0b5265
[admin@Home] /zerotier> controller/member/set 0 authorized=yes
```
Verify newly configured IP address and route:
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> /ip/address/print where interface~"Zero"
Flags: D - DYNAMIC
Columns: ADDRESS, NETWORK, INTERFACE
# ADDRESS NETWORK INTERFACE
4 D 172.27.27.15/24 172.27.27.0 myZeroTier
```
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> /ip/route/pr where gateway~"Zero"
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; A - ACTIVE; c, y - COPY
Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE
DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY DISTANCE
DAc 172.27.27.0/24 myZeroTier 0
```
RouterOS Office
Configuration on the Office device. We will enable the default instance and ask a controller to join the 879c0b5265a99e4b network:
```
[admin@office] /zerotier> interface/add network=879c0b5265a99e4b instance=zt1 name=ZT-interface
[admin@office] /zerotier> interface/print interval=1
Columns: NAME, MAC-ADDRESS, NETWORK, STATUS
# NAME MAC-ADDRESS NETWORK STATUS
0 ZT-interface 4A:40:1C:38:97:BA 879c0b5265a99e4b ACCESS_DENIED
```
As previously, because our network is private, we have to authorize a new peer via "RouterOS home device". After that verify from controller received IP
address and route:
```
[admin@Home] /zerotier> controller/member/print
Flags: A - AUTHORIZED
Columns: NETWORK, ZT-ADDRESS, IP-ADDRESS, LAST-SEEN
# NETWORK ZT-ADDRESS IP-ADDRESS LAST-SEEN

## Summary
MikroTik RouterOS supports various types of Ethernet interfaces - ranging from 10Mbps to 10Gbps Ethernet over copper twisted pair, 1Gbps, 10Gbps,
25Gbps SFP/SFP+/SFP28 interfaces and 40Gbps, 100Gbps QSFP+/QSFP28 interfaces. Certain RouterBoard devices are equipped with a combo
interface that simultaneously contains two interface types (e.g. Ethernet over twisted pair and SFP/SFP+ interface) allowing to select the most suitable
option or creating a physical link failover. Through RouterOS, it is possible to control different Ethernet related properties like link speed, auto-negotiation,
duplex mode, etc, monitor a transceiver diagnostic information and see a wide range of Ethernet related statistics.

## Auto-negotiation and forced link mode
Auto-negotiation is a communication method and a set of steps employed by Ethernet devices connected via twisted pair cables. It enables these devices
to agree on key transmission settings, including speed, duplex mode, and flow control. During this process, the connected devices initially exchange
information about their capabilities concerning these settings. Afterward, they mutually select the best possible transmission mode that both devices can
support effectively.
In RouterOS, auto-negotiation is always enabled by default and it selects the best possible transmission mode based on configured advertise arguments
which acepts multiple values. Other option is to force the interface into single speed, but for this property to work it requires disabled auto-negotiation.
```
# Enabled auto-negotiation (default) with multiple advertise values
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=ether2 ] advertise=100M-baseT-full,1G-baseT-full
```
```
# Disabled auto-negotiation with single speed value
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=ether3 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=100M-baseT-full
```

## Advertise
Prior to RouterOS version 7.12, when auto-negotiation was enabled interfaces attempted to guess the maximum available speed of the interface on the
other end (making the advertise setting inapplicable for SFP/QSFP interfaces).
After the RouterOS version 7.12, you can now manually set the advertise bits to specify the desired link modes you want to use. The speed arguments
have also been revised to provide clearer representation, as the previous values were too ambiguous. Additionally, the full-duplex setting has been
removed because the new link modes already encompass the duplex options(see table below).
```
Link Modes (for advertise and speed properties) Description
```
```
For additional information about MikroTik SFP and QSFP type of interfaces and their compatibility, please refer to wired interface compatibility
page.
```
```
RouterOS SFP/QSFP auto-negotiation does not support the same mechanisms as Ethernet interfaces, this is just extra way to influence
guessing the link mode to set for the interface.

Before manually configuring the advertise bits for your interface, first determine which bits are supported by executing the command /interface
ethernet monitor and checking the "supported" list. You can also view the advertise bits supported by your transceiver under "sfp-supported" field.
Additionally, the "advertising" will show the bits that RouterOS has automatically set. The list is generated by comparing the maximum available link mode
values on your interface and transceiver and selecting the ones that match.
```
Link Mode Naming Scheme
```
```
Transmission Rates: The first number followed by 'M' or 'G' (e.g., 10M, 100M, 1G) represents the data transmission rates in megabits or gigabits
per second.
```
```
Interface Types: The symbols after "base" indicate the interface types:
```
```
T: Stands for twisted pair cabling, followed by the duplex mode (either half or full).
SR-LR: Stands for "short-range" and "long-range" optical modules, including other variants like LRM, ER, ZR, etc. These link modes
should be used with optical modules.
CR: Stands for twin-axial copper and is used with direct attach cable (DAC). For 1Gbps DAC, the appropriate link mode is 1G-baseX.
```
```
Number of Lines:
```
```
CR2: means two lines.
CR4: means four lines.
```

One application where manually set advertise settings could be used is for all of sub-interfaces under QSFP. The overall configuration process starts with
the topmost enabled port. If the chosen mode is valid and supported, it will be applied. If that particular link mode requires multiple lanes, the advertise and
speed configuration of the next interface is ignored, but the interface should remain enabled. The next available free lane or port follows a similar process.
```
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-1 ] advertise=50G-baseCR2
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-3 ] advertise=25G-baseCR
set [ find default-name=qsfp28-1-4 ] advertise=25G-baseCR
```
Forced Mode
In the situation when a warning message appears in the log records after connecting the DAC cable or optical module, as example:
```
10:20:47 interface,warning sfp-sfpplus1 module auto-initialization failed, try forced-mode
```
This may indicate that the connected cable or module has a corrupted or bad EEPROM checksum, which causes the automatic connection configuration to
fail. This functionality was introduced in RouterOS version 7.12 and may affect some links that worked in the past by mistake with wrongly assumed module
/cable attributes, which could lead to various problems related to link connection and device functionality.
In such cases, you can attempt to set the link mode manually, and this might help establish a working link. The following forced port setting examples are
provided:
```
For DAC cables and connection speeds of 1G/10G/25G:
```
```
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=1G-baseT-full
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseCR
```
```
For optical modules and connection speeds of 1G/10G/25G:
```
```
/interface ethernet
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=1G-baseX
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
set [ find default-name=sfp-sfpplus1 ] auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
```
FEC
```
Note: When selecting the interface speed setting, pay attention to what rates your DAC cable supports (check cable specification data)
```
```
Note: When selecting the interface speed setting, pay attention to what rates your optical module supports (check module specification data)
```
FEC (Forward Error Correction) is a digital signal processing method that improves the bit error rate of SFP28, QSFP+, and QSFP28 links by adding
information (parity bits) to the data at the transmitter side. The receiver side then uses this  information to detect and correct errors that may have been
introduced during transmission.
To ensure a successful link, the same fec-mode should be used on both ends of the link. RouterOS uses a disabled fec-mode as the default setting, but it
can be changed to fec74 (also known as FC-FEC) or fec91 (also known as RS-FEC). For more information on FEC mode options, refer to the property
description. The table below shows the FEC modes supported for each link mode:

```
Advertised link modes, only applies when auto-negotiation is enabled.
Advertising higher speeds than the actual interface supported speed can
result in undefined behavior. Multiple options are allowed.
```
arp (disabled | enabled | local-proxy-arp | proxy-arp | reply-only;
Default: enabled)
```
Address Resolution Protocol mode:
```
```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
local-proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and
sends replies to the same interface
proxy-arp - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends
replies to other interfaces
reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originated from
matching IP address/MAC address combinations which are entered as
static entries in the ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically
stored in the ARP table. Therefore for communications to be successful,
a valid static entry must already exist.
```
arp-timeout (auto | integer; Default: auto) How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are
received from IP. Value auto equals to the value of arp-timeout in IP
/Settings, default is 30s.
auto-negotiation (yes | no; Default: yes) When enabled, the interface "advertises" its maximum capabilities to achieve
the best connection possible.
```
Note1: Auto-negotiation should not be disabled on one end only,
otherwise Ethernet Interfaces may not work properly.
Note2: Gigabit Ethernet and NBASE-T Ethernet links cannot work with
auto-negotiation disabled.
```
bandwidth (integer/integer; Default: unlimited/unlimited) Sets max rx/tx bandwidth in kbps that will be handled by an interface. TX limit
is supported on all Atheros switch-chip ports. RX limit is supported only on
Atheros8327/QCA8337 switch-chip ports.
cable-setting (default | short | standard; Default: default) Changes the cable length setting (only applicable to NS DP83815/6 cards)
combo-mode (auto | copper | sfp; Default: auto) When auto mode is selected, the port that was first connected will establish
the link. In case this link fails, the other port will try to establish a new link. In
case of a reboot, any of the two ports can be running, it depends on which
port will successfully establish the link first. When sfp mode is selected, the
interface will only work through SFP/SFP+ cage. When copper mode is
selected, the interface will only work through RJ45 Ethernet port.
comment (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of an item
disable-running-check (yes | no; Default: yes) Disable running check. If this value is set to 'no', the router automatically
detects whether the NIC is connected with a device in the network or not.
Default value is 'yes' because older NICs do not support it. (relevant only to
CHR and x86)
fec-mode (auto | fec74 | fec91 | off; Default: auto) Changes Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode for SFP28, QSFP+ and
QSFP28 interfaces. Same mode should be used on both link ends, otherwise
FEC mismatch could result in non-working link or even false link-ups.
```
It is recommended to enable FEC, particularly when creating link between
CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches. Some optical modules might rely on FEC
functionality in MACs.
```
```
auto - same as off
fec74 - enables IEEE 802.3 clause 74 FEC (aka FC-FEC), can be used
with 25Gbps, 40Gbps and 50Gbps link modes
fec91 - enables IEEE 802.3 clause 91 FEC (aka RS-FEC), can be used
with 25Gbps, 50Gbps and 100Gbps link modes
off - disabled FEC.
```
tx-flow-control (on | off | auto; Default: off) When set to on, the port will generate pause frames to the upstream device
to temporarily stop the packet transmission. Pause frames are only
generated when some routers output interface is congested and packets
cannot be transmitted anymore. auto is the same as on except when auto-
negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what
other end advertises.
rx-flow-control (on | off | auto; Default: off) When set to on, the port will process received pause frames and suspend
transmission if required. auto is the same as on except when auto-
negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what
other end advertises.
full-duplex (yes | no; Default: yes) Defines whether the transmission of data appears in two directions
simultaneously, only applies when auto-negotiation is disabled. Since
RouterOS v7.12, the setting is replaced with new speed link modes.
l2mtu (integer [0..65536]; Default: ) Layer2 Maximum transmission unit. Read more.
mac-address (MAC; Default: ) Media Access Control number of an interface.
mdix-enable (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether the MDI/X auto cross over cable correction feature is enabled for
the port (Hardware specific, e.g. ether1 on RB500 can be set to yes/no.
Fixed to 'yes' on other hardware.)
mtu (integer [0..65536]; Default:  1500 ) Layer3 Maximum transmission unit
name (string; Default: ) Name of an interface
orig-mac-address (read-only: MAC; Default: ) Original Media Access Control number of an interface.
passthrough-interface (interface; Default: ) Sets an interface in passthrough mode on CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe device.
By default, the PCIe interface will show up as four virtual Ethernet interfaces.
Two interfaces in passthrough mode to the 25G SFP28 cages. The
remaining two virtual Ethernet-PCIe interfaces are bridged with the Gigabit
Ethernet port for management access.
poe-out (auto-on | forced-on | off; Default: off) Poe Out settings. Read more.
poe-priority (integer [0..99]; Default: ) Poe Out settings. Read more.
sfp-shutdown-temperature (integer; Default: 95 |  80 ) The temperature in Celsius at which the interface will be temporarily turned
off due to too high detected SFP module temperature (introduced v6.48).
The default value for SFP/SFP+/SFP28 interfaces is 95, and for QSFP+
/QSFP28 interfaces 80 (introduced v7.6).
sfp-rate-select (high | low; Default: high) Allows to control rate select pin for SFP ports.

Detect Cable Problems
A cable test can detect problems or measure the approximate cable length if the cable is unplugged on the other end and there is, therefore, "no-link".
RouterOS will show:
```
which cable pair is damaged
the distance to the problem
how exactly the cable is broken - short-circuited or open-circuited
```
This also works if the other end is simply unplugged - in that case, the total cable length will be shown.
Here is an example output:
```
[admin@CCR] > interface ethernet cable-test ether2
name: ether2
status: no-link
cable-pairs: open:4,open:4,open:4,open:4
```
In the above example, the cable is not shorted but “open” at 4 meters distance, all cable pairs are equally faulty at the same distance from the switch chip.
Currently cable-test is implemented on the following devices:

Stats
Using "/interface ethernet print stats" command, it is possible to see a wide range of Ethernet-related statistics. The list of statistics can differ
between RouterBoard devices due to different Ethernet drivers. The list below contains all available counters across all RouterBoard devices. Most of the
Ethernet statistics can be remotely monitored using SNMP and MIKROTIK-MIB.
```
Currently cable-test is not supported on Combo ports.

## MikroTik SFP/SFP+/SFP28/QSFP+/QSFP28 compatibility
This article shows the compatibility of MikroTik devices with SFP, SFP+, SFP28, QSFP+, and QSFP28 transceivers. It features detailed compatibility
tables that provide valuable insights into which transceivers are suitable for use with MikroTik devices. Additionally, some practical configuration examples
are provided using the RouterOS CLI to set different data transmission rates. For more detailed descriptions of properties, please refer to the Ethernet user
manual.

MikroTik devices and SFP, SFP+, SFP28, QSFP+, and QSFP28 modules do not have any restrictions for other vendor equipment.
```
```
While MikroTik cannot ensure full compatibility with modules from all manufacturers, as long as the other vendor modules and devices comply
with transceiver multi-source agreement (MSA) they should be compatible with MikroTik.
```
```
RouterOS uses a disabled FEC mode as the default setting for SFP28 and QSFP28 interfaces. To ensure a successful link with other vendor
devices, you may need to enable FEC mode by configuring it to either fec74 or fec91. For more information please refer to the Ethernet user
manual.

SFP+ interface compatibility with 1G optical transceivers
For MikroTik devices with SFP+ interface that support both 10G and 1G link rate, following settings must be set on both linked devices for required
interfaces. These settings only relate when optical SFP transceivers are used. In order to get them working in 1G link rate, use the following configuration:
```
# Since RouterOS v7.12
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=1G-baseX
```
```
# Older RouterOS
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=1Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
```
auto-negotiation disabled
port speed 1G
full-duplex
```

SFP+ interface compatibility with 10G/25G optical transceivers
MikroTik devices with SFP+ ports can establish 10G links using 10G/25G optical fiber transceivers, however additional SFP Rate Select setting must be
configured to avoid data corruption during transmission. The following settings are required on the SFP+ interface:
```
# Since RouterOS v7.12
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR sfp-rate-select=low
```
```
# Older RouterOS
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10Gbps full-duplex=yes sfp-rate-select=low
```
This requirement applies to MikroTik 10G/25G modules:
```
XS+31LC10D
XS+2733LC15D
```
SFP+/SFP28 interface compatibility with 2.5G transceivers
The 2.5G link rate support is implemented since RouterOS v7.3. MikroTik devices with SFP+ and SFP28 interfaces that support 2.5G link rate require
following settings to be set on both linked device interfaces.
```
# Since RouterOS v7.12
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=2.5G-baseX
```
```
# Older RouterOS
/interface ethernet set sfp-sfpplus1 auto-negotiation=no speed=2.5Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
```
auto-negotiation disabled
port speed 2.5G
full-duplex
```

```
QSFP+/QSFP28 interface supported link rates
In RouterOS, QSFP+ and QSFP28 interfaces are designed to handle high-speed data transmission by utilizing multiple channels. Each QSFP+ or QSFP28
interface is divided into four sub-interfaces, each corresponding to a transmission channel necessary for proper operation.
Below are examples of how QSFP+ and QSFP28 interfaces appear in RouterOS:

### # QSFP+
```
/interface ethernet print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, MTU, MAC-ADDRESS, ARP, SWITCH
# NAME MTU MAC-ADDRESS ARP SWITCH
1 qsfpplus1-1 1500 48:8F:5A:B6:09:8C enabled switch1
2 qsfpplus1-2 1500 48:8F:5A:B6:09:8D enabled switch1
3 qsfpplus1-3 1500 48:8F:5A:B6:09:8E enabled switch1
4 qsfpplus1-4 1500 48:8F:5A:B6:09:8F enabled switch1
```
```
# QSFP28
/interface ethernet print
Flags: R - RUNNING
Columns: NAME, MTU, MAC-ADDRESS, ARP, SWITCH
# NAME MTU MAC-ADDRESS ARP SWITCH
1 qsfp28-1-1 1500 DC:2C:6E:9E:11:14 enabled switch1
2 qsfp28-1-2 1500 DC:2C:6E:9E:11:15 enabled switch1
3 qsfp28-1-3 1500 DC:2C:6E:9E:11:16 enabled switch1
4 qsfp28-1-4 1500 DC:2C:6E:9E:11:17 enabled switch1
```
Configuration and monitoring for these sub-interfaces may vary based on factors such as auto-negotiation, advertised speeds, and the type of transceiver
(e.g., break-out cable or single fiber). The following sections will provide guidance on the configuration necessary for each use case.
```
The naming convention for QSFP+ and QSFP28 sub-interfaces includes two parts:
```
```
The first digit following "qsfpplus" or "qsfp28-" represents the QSFP+ or QSFP28 physical interface.
The second digit, ranging from 1 to 4, denotes each of the individual channels.
```
```
Disabling or enabling any of the four sub-interfaces will trigger a reconfiguration of the entire port group, restarting all four channels.
```
QSFP+
For MikroTik CRS3xx series devices, QSFP+ interfaces support the following link speeds:
```
1x 40G
4x 10G
4x 1G
```
Link Configuration:
```
40G: Can be configured with either auto-negotiation or a forced 40G speed.
4x10G and 4x1G: Must be set with a forced speed mode and auto-negotiation disabled.
```
Starting from RouterOS version 7.12, in addition to choosing the right transmission rate, it's important to specify the correct link mode. For example, you
might use CR4 for DAC(Direct Attach Copper) or SR4-LR4 for optical fiber.
Configuration Examples:
For RouterOS v7.12 and later:
```
# 1x40G - DAC
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=40G-baseCR4
```
```
# 1x40G - Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=40G-baseSR4-LR4
```
```
# 4x10G - DAC
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
```
```
# 4x10G - Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseSR-LR
```
For RouterOS versions earlier than v7.12:
```
# 1x40G - DAC/Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=40Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
```
# 4x10G - DAC/Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10Gbps full-duplex=yes
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=10Gbps full-duplex=yes
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=10Gbps full-duplex=yes
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=10Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
QSFP28
For MikroTik CRS5xx series and CCR2216 devices, QSFP28 interfaces support the following link speeds:
```
1x 100G
2x 50G (available since RouterOS v7.12)
1x 40G
4x 25G
4x 10G
4x 1G
```
```
In single-link mode, only the first QSFP+ sub-interface needs to be configured, while the remaining sub-interfaces should remain enabled.
```
Link Configuration:
```
100G: Can be configured with either auto-negotiation or a forced 100G speed.
2x50G, 1x40G, 4x25G, 4x10G, and 4x1G: Must be set with a forced speed mode and auto-negotiation disabled.
```
Starting from RouterOS version 7.12, in addition to choosing the right transmission rate, it's important to specify the correct link mode. For example, you
might use CR4 for DAC(Direct Attach Copper) or SR4-LR4 for optical fiber.
Configuration Examples:
For RouterOS v7.12 and later:
```
# 1x100G - DAC
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=100G-baseCR4
```
```
# 1x100G - Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-2-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=100G-baseSR4-LR4
```
```
# 2x50G - DAC
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=50G-baseCR2
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=50G-baseCR2
```
```
# 2x50G - Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=50G-baseSR2-LR2

/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
```
For RouterOS versions earlier than v7.12:
```
# 1x100G - DAC/Optical
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=100Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
```
# 4x25G - DAC/Optical

/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=25Gbps full-duplex=yes
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=25Gbps full-duplex=yes
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=25Gbps full-duplex=yes
```
QSFP+/QSFP28 interface compatibility with breakout cables
MikroTik devices can establish links between QSFP+/QSFP28 and SFP+/SFP28 ports using breakout cables.
Configuration Examples:
```
Not supported: 1x 50G, 2x 40G
```
```
In single-link mode, only the first QSFP28 sub-interface needs to be configured, while the remaining sub-interfaces should remain enabled.
Similarly, for 2x50G link mode, only the master interfaces (e.g., qsfp28-1-1 and qsfp28-1-3) need to be configured, but the other sub-interfaces
must remain enabled.
```
For RouterOS v7.12 and later:

### # QSFP+ - DAC
```
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfpplus1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=10G-baseCR
```
```

/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-4 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseSR-LR
```
It is also possible to use QSFP28 to 2x50G QSFP28 Breakout Cables:
```
# 2x50G - DAC
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=50G-baseCR2

/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-3 auto-negotiation=no speed=50G-baseSR2-LR2
```
Or to configure different speed rates for each QSFP+/QSFP28 sub-interfaces:

### # QSFP28 - DAC
```
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-1 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseCR
/interface ethernet set qsfp28-1-2 auto-negotiation=no speed=25G-baseCR

# PWR Line

## Summary
The PWR-Line series devices allow Ethernet-like connectivity between supported devices over regular power lines. When plugged into the same electrical
circuit, the PWR-Line devices will establish connectivity by using the HomePlug AV standard.

## Properties
```
arp (disabled |
enabled | proxy-arp |
reply-only; Default: e
nabled)
```
```
Address Resolution Protocol mode:
```
```
disabled - the interface will not use ARP
enabled - the interface will use ARP
proxy-arp - the interface will use the ARP proxy feature
reply-only - the interface will only reply to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which
are entered as static entries in the "/ip arp" table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the ARP table.
Therefore for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
```
```
bandwidth (integer
/integer; Default: unli
mited/unlimited)
```
```
Sets max rx/tx bandwidth in kbps that will be handled by an interface. TX limit is supported on all Atheros switch-chip ports. RX
limit is supported only on Atheros8327/QCA8337 switch-chip ports.
```
```
comment (string;
Default: )
```
```
Descriptive name of an item
```
```
l2mtu (integer [0..
65536]; Default: )
```
```
Layer2 Maximum transmission unit. MTU in RouterOS
```
```
mac-address (MAC;
Default: )
```
```
Media Access Control number of an interface.
```
```
mtu (integer [0..
65536]; Default: 1500 )
```
```
Layer3 Maximum transmission unit
```
```
name (string;
Default: )
```
```
Name of an interface
```
```
orig-mac-address (M
AC; Default: )
```
```
rx-flow-control (on |
off | auto; Default: off)
```
```
When set to on, the port will process received pause frames and suspend transmission if required. auto is the same as on
except when auto-negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what the other end advertises. The
feature is supported on AR724x, AR9xxx, and QCA9xxx CPU ports, all CCR ports, and all Atheros switch chip ports.
```
```
tx-flow-control (on |
off | auto; Default: off)
```
```
When set to on, the port will send pause frames when specific buffer usage thresholds are met. auto is the same as on except
when auto-negotiation=yes flow control status is resolved by taking into account what the other end advertises. The feature is
supported on AR724x, AR9xxx, and QCA9xxx CPU ports, all CCR ports, and all Atheros switch chip ports.
```

## Menu specific commands
```
Property Description
```
```
configure () The command configures the attached PWR-Line device's network-key, network-password, plc-cco-selection-mode.
```
```
join () Initiates the pairing sequence which will look for other PWR-Line devices in the same electrical circuit that is also in the pairing mode.
This mode lasts for 60 seconds.
```
```
leave () Initiates the leaving sequence which essentially randomizes the device's network-key.
```
```
monitor () Outputs PWR-Line-related statuses in real-time.
```
```
upgrade-
firmware ()
```
```
Upgrades the PWR-Line device with specified firmware-file and pib-file files.
```
Configuration example
For two or more devices to be able to connect with each other, they must share the same network-key value. The currently configured network-key can be
seen using the monitor command as plc-actual-network-key.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface pwr-line monitor pwr-line1
name: pwr-line1
connection-to-plc: ok
tx-flow-control: no
rx-flow-control: no
plc-actual-network-key: c973947c200e1540b0f84b571d92bebe
plc-hw-platform: QCA7420
plc-sw-platform: MAC
plc-fw-version: 1.4.0(24-20180515-CS)
plc-line-freq: 50Hz
plc-zero-crossing: detected
plc-mac: B8:69:F4:C4:34:68
```
Method 1
There are two ways to set the same network-key on different devices. You can either use the network-key parameter which is a hashed version of network-
password parameter. Or use the network-password parameter and let the router apply the hash on a human-readable string.
For example:
```
/interface pwr-line configure pwr-line1 network-password=mynetwork
```
is the same as:
```
/interface pwr-line configure pwr-line1 network-key=cb01fcc6167bf3d1edb1433c2ebde4b3
```
You must set the same key or password on all devices you wish to communicate with each other.
Method 2
It is possible to use the join and leave commands and make the PWR-Line devices automatically synchronize the network-key value. It is advised to use
the leave command before using the join command to make sure a new network-key is randomly generated and the device is not part of any old network.
```
/interface pwr-line leave pwr-line1
```
Then we can issue the join command. When doing so, the pairing sequence is enabled for 60 seconds, meaning you have to enable pairing mode on
another device within 60 seconds for them to successfully pair.
```
/interface pwr-line join pwr-line1
```
Method 3
It is also possible to set a specified role for the PWR-Line device (master or slave) with the plc-cco-selection-mode parameter.
```
Property Description
```
```
plc-cco-selection-mode (auto | always | never;
Default: auto)
```
```
Sets PWR-Line device mode:
```
```
auto - PWR-Line will automatically decide what role to take depending on the situation upon
joining a PWR-Line network.
always - PWR-Line will always be forced to act as "central-coordinator" or master device.
never - PWR-Line will always be forced to act as a slave device.
```
Example:
```
/interface pwr-line configure pwr-line1 plc-cco-selection-mode=auto
```
```
/interface pwr-line configure pwr-line1 plc-cco-selection-mode=always
```
```
/interface pwr-line configure pwr-line1 plc-cco-selection-mode=never
```
Sync Button usage
```
Hold 0.5 – 3 seconds to turn on sync mode. For 120 seconds will try to communicate with another PWR-LINE device. A blinking orange LED light
indicates that it is in search mode. You have to also do the same on the other PWR-LINE device, so they can synchronize. Press the button again
to cancel the search. You can also manually set the security keys in RouterOS settings.
```
```
Hold 5 – 8 seconds to generate a new security key. This is needed to remove a PWR-LINE device from an existing PWR-LINE network.
```
```
Hold 10 – 15 seconds to reset all PWR-LINE related settings.
```
Supported Hardware
The device is fully compatible with our PWR-LINE AP and the newest revisions of products that have a MicroUSB port, such as hAP lite, hAP lite tower,
hAP mini, mAP, and mAP lite have a pwr-line interface. A simple software upgrade to v6.44+ enables this feature (supported by the mentioned devices
with serial numbers that end with /9xx). PWR-LINE functionality is also supported by some previously manufactured units - if you have a unit with a serial
number that ends with /8xx, upgrade to 6.44+ and see if the pwr-line interface shows up).


# Wireless
```
In This Section:
```
```
This section will describe the configuration of 802.11 wireless protocols and best use examples.
```
```
Wireless capabilities of a router can greatly enhance the usability of your home or office network or provide a solution for industrial structures.
Choosing the right device for setup can be a puzzle to inexperienced users. This guide intends to explain different parameters and suggest a thought
process to not get lost in the vast selection of MikroTik routers.
```

## RouterOS package type
```
Since RouterOS v7.13 some MikroTik devices can choose between two types of Wireless NPK package (ie. wireless drivers), depending on the
required features and the device type. More details can be found in the respective documentation sections. CAPsMAN functionality is included in the
routeros bundle package, regardless of CPU architecture and independent of wireless drivers, ie. you can run CAPsMAN on an model.
```
```
In short:
```
```
CAPsMAN can run anywhere, on any MikroTik device. You can run both new and old CAPsMAN at the same time in most cases (when
running both on an AX router, built in cards can't be used)
MIPS type devices have no choice of driver, only legacy drivers are supported
ARM CPU 802.11AC wireless devices and 802.11AX wireless devices have a choice of wireless driver.
```
```
The below table helps you choose in this case:
```

## Old 802.11ac ARM CPU devices*

Frequencies
MikroTik provides routers with interfaces in 3 frequency bands - 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 60GHz. Each frequency band has its own advantages and use
cases.
2.4GHz
Nowadays considered legacy because of overuse, it is still the most widely supported band. If you have a wireless client like phone, laptop or another
device, it will most probably support this band. Even IoT devices often support 2.4GHz band. Because of the lower frequency, the 2.4GHz band can
better overcome obstacles, so sequentially it has a bigger range than a 5GHz device, but it also usually has smaller throughput (internet speed). Also,
it can severely suffer from interference (noise) from other 2.4GHz wireless devices, because almost every home access point supports 2.4GHz band
and it performs well through walls and over large distances also, there are fewer frequencies to choose from (3 non-overlapping). If you have many
close neighbors (apartments, shared office building) chances are 2.4GHz band will be saturated and performance will be lower. This band can also be
used for industrial links.
5GHz
Usually, new phones and laptops also support 5GHz band. If your client device and router support 802.11ac (sometimes referred to as just "ac") it will
be faster than the 2.4GHz band. 5GHz band has more frequencies to choose from, but also usually has a lower range than 2.4GHz band. If you have
new client devices, your network will benefit from an ac router. The 5GHz band is also often used for industrial links, because of the big frequency
range.
60GHz
Currently, there are very few client devices (phones, laptops) that support the 60GHz band. However, it offers cutting edge solutions for industrial
links. For example, if you have 2 points that must be connected at distances up to 1500 meters you will get a 1 Gbps duplex link. For example, one of
the MikroTik products is called the Wireless Wire because it provides the same speed as 1Gbps wired connection, but you will need a clear line of
sight to establish the link.
Use case
RouterOS software on MikroTik devices provides broad and coherent configuration possibilities. RouterOS software allows you to use MikroTik
devices in many ways, for example, if needed, a "home access point" device can be easily reconfigured to act as a client or form a point to point link, if
needed. The "home AP" is simply the default configuration, but it can be changed to whatever configuration you wish. That being said, it is best to use
hardware for its intended purpose.
Home AP for phones and laptops
Before you determine the most optimal choice for your setup, you should answer questions like how many clients you want to connect, what range you
should cover and what speeds you want to get.
Client count
More connected clients mean higher latency and smaller throughput. We recommend 20-50 clients per interface to reach the peak performance,
depending on conditions the number of clients can go up to 100 and still work stable. If clients will need high throughput or data traffic is time sensitive
it is advised to plan fewer clients per access point. Often it is beneficial to choose simpler access points but place them denser.
Range
The range of wireless connections depends on many conditions. Some of those are antenna gain, transmit power of router and client device,
interference from other devices, obstacles (walls, metal objects), router placement. An important factor to note is that all involved devices affect the
achievable distance, meaning that no matter how strong and sensitive your AP is, a small phone will be limited by its own transmit power and
sensitivity. One device is unable to cover large areas if the client devices are mobile phones. Usually, only a few hundred meters can be achieved and
more AP devices are required to cover bigger areas.
```
Antenna gain is measured in dBi and determines how narrow the beam is. The radiation pattern of 0 dBi (practically impossible) is of the
shape of a sphere, 1.5 dBi - 5 dBi radiates to all directions almost equally but has some dents and sides where the signal will be stronger. > 9
dBi has an obvious directional radiation pattern. Antennas with higher antenna gain if properly positioned will reach further in the necessary
direction.
Transmit power measured in dBm or mW determines signal strength that is coming out of a wireless interface. Mobile devices usually have
small transmit power to save battery power. Even if, for example, phone reports an OK received signal strength, the router may receive a
weak signal from the phone.
```
```
Interference from other devices increases the noise floor and it gets harder for the router to distinguish signal from noise, therefore, the signal
must be stronger and client closer to the access point. Access points in the same frequency occupy the same air time decreasing throughput
and increased latency.
```
```
Some objects decrease (attenuate) signal strength while others reflect the signal. Usually, in buildings, you have to keep in mind walls and
their thickness, floor, and ceiling, metallic objects, glass, and wood also attenuate the signal.
```
```
Placement of access point also affects range. The access point shouldn't be covered by metallic objects or surfaces so the signal would have
space to spread.
```
Speed
If speed is important, then you should choose a 5GHz wireless router with 802.11 ac support.
For other wireless antennas to connect (CPE to AP)
Often it is necessary to connect two or more points, like, connect buildings on campus or connect client homes to network, or establish a long link.
MikroTik provides solutions in these situations too. In order to choose, you must know the distance, whether you have to connect two points (point to
point - PtP) or multiple points (point to multipoint - PtMP) and what speeds you need.
Distance
Because in these situations we are dealing with directional antennas and big distances, you must keep in mind that alignment and line of sight are
crucial. For small distances up to 1500 meters, we advise using 60 GHz devices which will provide stability and great speed. Also, in small distances,
2.4 GHz or 5 GHz devices with small antenna gain will do just fine, although, you won't get such speeds as with 60 GHz devices. For longer links
antenna gain and transmit power should be taken into consideration. Higher signal strength will allow higher data rates which mean higher throughput.
Choose your frequency wisely to escape interference with other wireless links. Keep in mind that in cities even above the roof there often is
interference from neighboring 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz links.
PtP or PtMP
PtP and PtMP links differ in some areas. For PtMP you most probably will want an antenna with a wider beam also called - sector antenna. Such
antenna covers a wider angle but also has less gain, therefore, less distance. Also in PtMP access point must have at least level 4 RouterOS software
license. Clients or devices that are connected to the access point and devices in PtP link can have license level 3 and narrower beamwidth.
Speed
For higher speeds in short links, you must choose 60 GHz devices, in longer distances - 5GHz ac devices.
Note
For controlling large networks of access points you can use AP Controller (CAPsMAN) (Controlled access point manager). All RouterOS devices can
act as CAPsMAN servers, however, it is advised to use appropriate devices for the task, with higher CPU power and more RAM. All RouterOS devices
with 2GHz and/or 5GHz interface and software level at least 4 can be CAP (Controlled access point) clients and connect to a CAPsMAN server. For
controlling hundreds of access points, we advise using our CCR series devices. For controlling thousands of access point you might want to try using
CHR or an x86 machine.

## Overview
The 'WiFi' configuration menu, introduced in RouterOS 7.13, is a RouterOS menu for managing Wi-Fi 5 wave2 and newer WiFi interfaces.
Devices with compatible radios also require either the 'wifi-qcom-ac' driver package (for 802.11ac chipsets) or the 'wifi-qcom'  driver package for 802.11ax
and newer chipsets.
The configuration menu used to be called 'wifiwave2' in RouterOS versions before 7.13, where it was a part of the 'wifiwave2' software package.
WiFi Terminology
Before we move on let's familiarize ourselves with terms important for understanding the operation of the menu. These terms will be used throughout the
article.
```
Profile - refers to the configuration preset created under one of this WiFi sub-menus: aaa, channel, security, datapath, or interworking.
Configuration profile - configuration preset defined under /interface/wifi/configuration, it can reference various profiles.
Station - wireless client.
```
Basic Configuration
Basic password-protected AP
```
/interface/wifi
set wifi1 disabled=no configuration.country=Latvia configuration.ssid=MikroTik security.authentication-
types=wpa2-psk,wpa3-psk security.passphrase=8-63_characters
```
Open AP with OWE transition mode
Opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE) allows the creation of wireless networks that do not require the knowledge of a password to connect, but still offer
the benefits of traffic encryption and management frame protection. It is an improvement on regular open access points.
However, since a network cannot be simultaneously encrypted and unencrypted, 2 separate interface configurations are required to offer connectivity to
older devices that do not support OWE and offer the benefits of OWE to devices that do.
This configuration is referred to as OWE transition mode.
```
/interface/wifi
add master-interface=wifi1 name=wifi1_owe configuration.ssid=MikroTik_OWE security.authentication-types=owe
security.owe-transition-interface=wifi1 configuration.hide-ssid=yes
set wifi1 configuration.country=Latvia configuration.ssid=MikroTik security.authentication-types="" security.
owe-transition-interface=wifi1_owe
enable wifi1,wifi1_owe
```
Client devices that support OWE will prefer the OWE interface. If you don't see any devices in your registration table that are associated with the regular
open AP, you may want to move on from running a transition mode setup to a single OWE-encrypted interface.
Resetting configuration
WiFi interface configurations can be reset by using the 'reset' command.
```
/interface/wifi reset wifi1
```
Configuration profiles
One of the new WiFi additions is configuration profiles, you can create various presets, that can be assigned to interfaces as needed. Configuration
settings for WiFi are grouped in profiles according to the parameter sections found at the end of this page - aaa, channel, configuration, datapath, interworki
ng, and security, and can then be assigned to interfaces. Configuration profiles can include other profiles as well as separate parameters from other
categories.
This optional flexibility is meant to allow each user to arrange their configuration in a way that makes the most sense for them, but it also means that each
parameter may have different values assigned to it in different sections of the configuration.

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.

### 4.
The following priority determines, which value is used:
```
Value in interface settings
Value in a profile assigned to the interface
Value in configuration profile assigned to interface
Value in a profile assigned to the configuration profile (which in turn is assigned to the interface).
```
If you are at any point unsure of which parameter value will be used for an interface, you can issue "/interface/wifi/print detail". The print command will
show all values that the interface will have, including inherited values.
To see only values that were configured directly on the interface, without displaying inherited ones, use "/interface/wifi/print config".
For an example of configuration profile usage, see the following:
```

Access List
The access list provides multiple ways of filtering and managing wireless connections.
RouterOS will check each new connection to see if its parameters match the parameters specified in any access list rule.
The rules are checked in the order they appear in the list. Only management actions specified in the first matching rule are applied to each connection.
Connections, which have been accepted by an access list rule, will be periodically checked, to see if they remain within the permitted time and signal-range.
If they do not, they will be terminated.
The access list has two kinds of parameters - filtering, and action. Filtering properties are only used for matching clients, to whom the access list rule
should be applied to. Action parameters can change connection parameters for that specific client and potentially overriding its default connection
parameters with ones specified in the access list rule.
MAC address authentication
Implemented through the query-radius action, MAC address authentication is a way to implement a centralized whitelist of client MAC addresses using a
RADIUS server.
When a client device tries to associate with an AP, which is configured to perform MAC address authentication, the AP will send an access-request
message to a RADIUS server with the device's MAC address as the user name and an empty password. If the RADIUS server answers with access-
accept to such a request, the AP proceeds with whatever regular authentication procedure (passphrase or EAP authentication) is configured for the
interface.
Access rule examples
Only accept connections to guest network from nearby devices during business hours
```
/interface/wifi/access-list/print detail
Flags: X - disabled
0 signal-range=-60..0 allow-signal-out-of-range=5m ssid-regexp="MikroTik Guest" time=7h-19h,mon,tue,wed,thu,
fri action=accept
```
```
1 ssid-regexp="MikroTik Guest" action=reject
```
Reject connections from locally-administered ('anonymous'/'randomized') MAC addresses
```
/interface/wifi/access-list/print detail
Flags: X - disabled
0 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:00 mac-address-mask=02:00:00:00:00:00 action=reject
```
Assigning a different passphrase for a specific client can be useful, if you need to provide wireless access to a client, but don't want to share your wireless
password, or don't want to create a separate SSID. When the matching client connects to this network, instead of using the password defined in the
interface configuration, the access list will make that client use a different password. Just make sure that the specific client doesn't get matched by a more
generic access list rule first.
Or reject all unknown MAC addresses, can be added as an ultimate rule, at the end of access list. - If you want to allow only specific clients on the network,
make sure to also add a reject rule at the end of access-list, as there is no implicit reject rule by default.
```
print detail and print detail config can also be used on /interface/wifi/configuration and will work in the same manner
as in /interface/wifi/ menu.
```
```
Before 7.15 /interface/wifi/actual-configuration/ menu was used, now the same functionality is achieved with the help of print
command.
```
```
Take care when writing access list rules which reject clients. After being repeatedly rejected by an AP, a client device may start avoiding it. The
VLAN ID can't be set by the access list to wifi-qcom-ac interface's clients, without configuring the pvid value for the interface first.
```
```
/interface wifi access-list
add action=accept disabled=no mac-address=22:F9:70:E5:D2:8E interface=wifi1 passphrase=StrongPassword
```
Frequency scan
The '/interface/wifi/frequency-scan wifi1' command provides information about RF conditions on available channels that can be obtained by running the
frequency-scan command. Used to approximate the spectrum usage, it can be useful to find less crowded frequencies.
Scan command
The '/interface wifi scan' command will scan for access points and print out information about any APs it detects. It doesn't show the frequency usage, per
channel, but it will reveal all access points that are transmitting. You can use the "connect" button, to initiate a connection to a specific AP.
The scan command takes all the same parameters as the frequency-scan command.
```
Running a frequency scan will disconnect all connected clients, or if the interface is in station mode, it will disconnect from AP.
```
Sniffer
The sniffer command enables monitor mode on a wireless interface. This turns the interface into a passive receiver for all WiFi transmissions.
The command continuously prints out information on received packets and can save them locally to a pcap file or stream them using the TZSP protocol.
The sniffer will operate on whichever channel is configured for the chosen interface.
Spectral scan
The spectral scan can scan frequencies supported by your wifi interface, and plot them directly in the console. The spectral scan has been available since
the 7.16beta1 version.
```
/interface/wifi/spectral-scan <wifiinterface name> range=
```
Continuously monitors spectral data. This command uses the same data source as 'spectral-history', and shares many parameters.
To use spectral scan, you must use the "range=" attribute.
Each line displays one spectrogram bucket -- frequency, magnitude (dBm), peak, and a character graphic bar. A bar shows power value with ':' characters
and average peak hold with '.' characters.
data - min/max/avg, by default average is used for data. The average should be used in most scenarios, but in some cases "min" can be useful to check if
there are any frequencies that have a constant signal output on them. Max represents the strongest signal that was detected during the interval of the
scan, similar to the peak.
duration - terminate command after a specified time. default is indefinite;
freeze-frame-interval - Time interval at which to update command output
interval - interval of how often to update the primary data values, not peak
peak-mode - avg/max/disabled - peak reflects the strongest signal over peak-hold-duration. By default "avg" is used, it is the average of max values over
"peak-hold-duration", if "max" is used, then the highest value will be shown until the next "peak-hold-duration" update.
peak-hold-duration - changes the peak hold duration used by peak-mode, by default 5 seconds.
range - scan specific range, required;
resolution - frequency step for spectral scan
show-interference - yes/no
Possible types of classified interference:
```
Microwave oven (MWO)
Continuous Wave (CW)
WLAN (Wideband) (WIFI)
```
```
Spectral scan is supported only by the wifi-qcom driver, it is not supported by the wifi-qcom-ac driver.
```
```
Cordless phone 2.4 (CORDLESS24)
Cordless phone 5 (CORDLESS5)
Bluetooth (BLUETOOTH)

```


# Spectral history
```
/interface/wifi/spectral-history <wifi interface name> range=
```
Plots spectrogram. Power values that fall in different ranges are printed as different colored characters with the same foreground and background color, so
it is possible to copy and paste the terminal output of this command.
data - min/max/avg, by default average is used for data. The average should be used in most scenarios, but in some cases "min" can be useful to check if
there are any frequencies that have a constant signal output on them. Max will show the strongest signal that was detected, instead of the average signal.
interv - interval of how often to update the data values;
interval - interval at which spectrogram lines are printed;
duration - terminate command after a specified time. default is indefinite;
range - scan specific range, required;
resolution - frequency step;
show-interference - yes/no

## WPS

## WPS client
The wps-client command enables obtaining authentication information from a WPS-enabled AP.
```
/interface/wifi/wps-client wifi1
```

## WPS server
An AP can be made to accept WPS authentication by a client device for 2 minutes by running the following command.
```
/interface/wifi wps-push-button wifi1
```
Radios
Information about the capabilities of each radio can be gained by running the `/interface/wifi/radio print detail` command.  It can be useful to see what
bands are supported by the interface and what channels can be selected. The country profile that is applied to the interface will influence the results.
```

```
While Radio information gives us information about supported channel width, it is also possible to deduce this information from the product page, to do so
you need to check the following parameters: number of chains, max data rate. Once you know these parameters, you need to check the modulation and
coding scheme (MCS) table, for example, here: https://mcsindex.com/.
If we take hAP ax^2 , as an example, we can see that number of chains is 2, and the max data rate is 1200 - 1201 in the MCS table. In the MCS table we
need to find entry for 2 spatial streams - chains, and the respective data rate, which in this case shows us that 80MHz is the maximum supported channel
width.
Registration table
'/interface/wifi/registration-table/' displays a list of connected wireless clients and detailed information about them.
De-authentication
Wireless peers can be manually de-authenticated (forcing re-association) by removing them from the registration table.
```
/interface/wifi/registration-table remove [find where mac-address=02:01:02:03:04:05]
```
WiFi CAPsMAN
WiFi CAPsMAN allows applying wireless settings to multiple MikroTik WiFi AP devices from a central configuration interface.
More specifically, the Controlled Access Point system Manager (CAPsMAN) allows the centralization of wireless network management. When using the
CAPsMAN feature, the network will consist of a number of 'Controlled Access Points' (CAP) that provide wireless connectivity and a 'system Manager'
(CAPsMAN) that manages the configuration of the APs, it also takes care of client authentication.
WiFi CAPsMAN only passes wireless configuration to the CAP, all forwarding decisions are left to the CAP itself - there is no CAPsMAN forwarding mode.
Requirements:
```
Any RouterOS device, that supports the WiFi package, can be a controlled wireless access point (CAP) as long as it has at least a Level 4
RouterOS license.
WiFi CAPsMAN server can be installed on any RouterOS device that supports the WiFi package, even if the device itself does not have a
wireless interface
Unlimited CAPs (access points) supported by CAPsMAN
```
Radio Provisioning
CAPsMAN distinguishes between actual wireless interfaces (radios) based on their built-in MAC address (radio-mac). This implies that it is impossible to
manage two radios with the same MAC address on one CAPsMAN. Radios currently managed by CAPsMAN (provided by connected CAPs) are listed in /
interface/wifi/radio menu, this list will also include the built-in wifi interfaces that are present on CAPsMAN itself if there are any:
```
[admin@c52i] > interface/wifi/radio/print
Flags: L - LOCAL
Columns: CAP, RADIO-MAC, INTERFACE
# CAP RADIO-MAC INTERFACE
0 L 18:FD:74:AF:F4:28 wifi1
1 L 18:FD:74:AF:F4:29 wifi2
2 hapAX3@192.168.88.30 48:A9:8A:0B:F7:4B cap1
```
When CAP connects, CAPsMAN at first tries to bind each CAP radio to CAPsMAN master interface based on radio-mac. If an appropriate interface is
found, the radio gets set up using master interface configuration and configuration of slave interfaces that refer to a particular master interface. At this
moment interfaces (both master and slaves) are considered bound to radio and radio is considered provisioned. This happens only if there were matching
static entries already present under /interface/wifi , typically if the entry was made previously either manually, or with provisioning rules that contain
action "create-enabled" or "create-disabled".
If no matching master interface for radio is found, CAPsMAN executes 'provisioning rules', which are defined under /interface/wifi/provisioning/.
Provisioning rules is an ordered list of rules that contain settings that specify which radio to match and settings that determine what action to take if a radio
matches.
When CAP joins CAPsMAN, and there is no matching interface for it present under /interface/wifi , provisioning rules will automatically be checked,
once a match is found, the CAP's wireless interface will appear under /interface/wifi. Such an interface is "provisioned", provisioned in this context
means that there is a wifi interface present for the radio, and it has a configuration profile assigned to it.
There is also an option to manually provision interfaces, which will make CAPsMAN start evaluating provisioning rules against the specific interface, and a
new interface will be created upon match. If there was already an entry present for the radio under /interface/wifi/, that entry will be deleted and re-
created. Manual provisioning re-creates the interface and is generally not needed, since provisioning rules are evaluated automatically, and if you change
the configuration profile associated with the provisioning rule, the changes will be applied to all wifi interfaces that use that configuration. If you manually
provision interfaces, the interface ID or name can change, resulting in broken references to other objects, for example, bridge ports.
Manual provision can be done under /interface/wifi/capsman/remote-cap/provision to provision all radios associated with specific CAPs, it
can also be done under /interface/wifi/radio/provision , to provision specific radios.
CAPsMAN cannot manage it's own wifi interfaces using configuration.manager=capsman, it is enough to just set the same configuration profile on
local interfaces manually as you would with provisioning rules, and the end result will be the same as if they were CAPs. That being said, it is also possible
to provision local interfaces via /interface/wifi/radio menu, it should be noted that to regain control of local interfaces after provisioning, you will
need to disable the matching provisioning rules and press "provision" again, which will return local interfaces to an unconfigured state.
CAPsMAN - CAP simple configuration example:
```
WiFi CAPsMAN can only control WiFi interfaces, and WiFi CAPs can join only WiFi CAPsMAN, similarly, regular CAPsMAN only supports non-
WiFi caps.
```
```
The CAPs don't send traffic usage information to CAPsMAN.
```
```
Provision must be done only initially, and is done automatically upon CAP joining if there are matching provisioning rules that are enabled.
If you adjust any configuration profile that is linked to the provisioned interface, all changes will be "pushed" as soon as you apply changes to
the profile, with no need to re-create the already existing interface.
Provisioning itself is not for sending configuration, it is for essentially creating a new interface. In most cases, there is no reason to perform
manual provisioning once you already have CAP interfaces running.
```
CAPsMAN in WiFi uses the same menu as a regular WiFi interface, meaning when you pass configuration to CAPs, you have to use the same
configuration, security, channel configuration, etc. as you would for regular WiFi interfaces.
CAPsMAN:
```
#create a security profile
/interface wifi security
add authentication-types=wpa3-psk name=sec1 passphrase=HaveAg00dDay
```
```
#create configuraiton profiles to use for provisioning
/interface wifi configuration
add country=Latvia name=5ghz security=sec1 ssid=CAPsMAN_5
add name=2ghz security=sec1 ssid=CAPsMAN2
add country=Latvia name=5ghz_v security=sec1 ssid=CAPsMAN5_v
```
```
#configure provisioning rules, configure band matching as needed
/interface wifi provisioning
add action=create-dynamic-enabled master-configuration=5ghz slave-configurations=5ghz_v supported-bands=\
5ghz-n
add action=create-dynamic-enabled master-configuration=2ghz supported-bands=2ghz-n
```
```
#enable CAPsMAN service
/interface wifi capsman
set ca-certificate=auto enabled=yes
```

### CAP:
```
#enable CAP service, in this case CAPsMAN is on same LAN, but you can also specify "caps-man-addresses=x.x.x.x"
here
/interface/wifi/cap set enabled=yes
```
```
#set configuration.manager= on the WiFi interface that should act as CAP
/interface/wifi/set wifi1,wifi2 configuration.manager=capsman-or-local
```
CAPsMAN - CAP VLAN configuration example:
In this example, we will assign VLAN10 to our main SSID, and will add VLAN20 for the guest network, ether5 from CAPsMAN is connected to CAP.
CAPsMAN:
```
You can configure sub-configuration menus, directly under "/interface/wifi/configuration" or reference previously created profiles in the main
configuration profile
```
```
If the CAP is hAP ax^2 or hAP ax^3 , it is strongly recommended to enable RSTP in the bridge configuration, on the CAP
```
```
configuration.manager should only be set on the CAP device itself, don't pass it to the CAP or configuration profile that you provision.
```
```
The interface that should act as CAP needs additional configuration under "interface/wifi/set wifiX configuration.manager="
```
```
CAPs using "wifi-qcom" package can get "vlan-id" via Datapath from CAPsMAN, CAPs using "wifi-qcom-ac" package will need to use the
configuration provided at the end of this example.

/interface/wifi/set wifi1,wifi2 configuration.manager=capsman-or-local
```
```
Passing datapaths "MAIN/GUEST" from the start of the example to "wifi-qcom-ac" CAP would be misconfiguration, make sure to use datapath
without "vlan-id" specified to such devices.

Some MikroTik Wi-Fi 5 APs, which ship with their interfaces managed by the 'wireless' menu, can install the additional 'wifi-qcom-ac' package to make their
interfaces compatible with the 'wifi' menu instead.
To do this, it is necessary to uninstall the 'wireless' package, then install 'wifi-qcom-ac'.
Compatibility
The wifi-qcom-ac package includes alternative drivers for IPQ4018/4019 and QCA9984 radios that make them compatible with the WiFi configuration
menu. For possible, wifi-qcom-ac/wifi-qcom/wireless, package combinations, please see the package types section here.
As a rule of thumb, the package is compatible with 802.11ac products, which have an ARM CPU. It is NOT compatible with any of our 802.11ac products
which have a MIPS CPU.
```

Channel properties
Properties in this category specify the desired radio channel.
```
Property Description
```
```
band (2ghz-g | 2ghz-n | 2ghz-ax
| 5ghz-a | 5ghz-ac | 5ghz-an | 5g
hz-ax)
```
```
Frequency band and wireless standard that will be used by the AP. Defaults to newest supported standard.
Note that band support is limited by radio capabilities.
```
```
frequency (list of integers or
integer ranges)
```
```
For an interface in AP mode, specifies frequencies (in MHz) to consider when picking control channel center
frequency.
```
```
For an interface in station mode, specifies frequencies on which to scan for APs.
```
```
Leave unset (default) to consider all frequencies supported by the radio and permitted by the applicable regulatory
profille.
```
```
The parameter can contain 1 or more comma-separated values of integers or, optionally, ranges of integers denoted
using the syntax RangeBeginning-RangeEnd:RangeStep
```
```
Examples of valid channel.frequency values:
```
```
2412
2412,2432,2472
5180-5240:20,5500-5580:20
```
```
secondary-frequency (list of
integers | 'disabled')
```
```
Frequency (in MHz) to use for the center of the secondary part of a split 80+80MHz channel.
```
```
Only official 80MHz channels (5210, 5290, 5530, 5610, 5690, 5775) are supported.
```
```
Leave unset (default) for automatic selection of secondary channel frequency.
```
```
skip-dfs-channels  (10min-cac |
all | disabled; default: disabled)
```
```
Whether to avoid using channels, on which channel availability check (listening for presence of radar signals) is
required.
```
```

all - interface will avoid using all channels, on which CAC is required
disabled  - interface may select any supported channel, regardless of CAC requirements
```
```
width ( 20mhz | 20/40mhz | 20
/40mhz-Ce | 20/40mhz-eC | 20
/40/80mhz | 20/40/80+80mhz |
20/40/80/160mhz)
```
```
Width of radio channel. Defaults to widest channel supported by the radio hardware.
```
```
reselect-interval (time interval; D
efault: disabled)
```
```
Specifies when the interface should rescan channel availability and select the most appropriate one to use.
Specifying interval will allow the system to select this interval dynamically and randomly. This helps to avoid a
situation when many APs at the same time scan the network, select the same channel, and prefer to use it at the
same time. reselect-interval uses a background scan.
```
```
The reselect process will choose the most suitable channel considering the number of networks in the channel,
channel usage, and overlap with networks in adjacent channels. It can be used with a list of frequencies defined, or
with frequency not set - using all supported frequencies.
```
Configuration properties
This section includes properties relating to the operation of the interface and the associated radio.
```
Property Description
```
```
antenna-gain (intege
r 0..30)
```
```
Overrides the default antenna gain. The master interface of each radio sets the antenna gain for every interface which uses the
same radio.
```
```
This setting cannot override the antenna gain to be lower than the minimum antenna gain of a radio.
No default value.
```
beacon-interval (time
interval 100ms..1s;
default: 100ms)
```
Interval between beacon frames of an AP.
```
chains (list of integer
0..7 )
```
Radio chains to use for receiving signals. Defaults to all chains available to the corresponding radio hardware.
```
country (name of a
country; default: Latv
ia)
```
Determines, which regulatory domain restrictions are applied to an interface.
```
distance () Maximum link distance in kilometers, needs to be set for long-range outdoor links. The value should reflect the distance to the
AP or station that is furthest from the device. Unconfigured value allows usage of 2 km links.
dtim-period (integer
1..255; default: 1 )
```
Period at which to transmit multicast traffic, when there are client devices in power save mode connected to the AP. Expressed
as a multiple of the beacon interval.
```
```
Higher values enable client devices to save more energy, but increase network latency.
```
hide-ssid (no | yes;
default: no) yes - AP does not include its SSID in beacon frames, and does not reply to probe requests that have broadcast SSID.
no - AP includes its SSID in the beacon frames, and replies to probe requests that have broadcast SSID.
manager (capsman |
capsman-or-local | lo
cal; default: local)
```
capsman - the interface will act as CAP only, this option should not be passed via provisioning rules to the CAP
```
```
capsman-or-local - the interface will get configuration via CAPsMAN or use its own, if /interface/wifi/cap is not enabled.
```
```
local - interface won't contact CAPsMAN in order to get configuration.
```
max-clients (integer
1..1000; default: 1000
)
```
Maximum number of associated clients.
```
mode (ap | station) Interface operation mode
```
ap (default) - interface operates as an access point
station - interface acts as a client device, scanning for access points advertising the configured SSID
station-bridge - interface acts as a client device and enables support for a 4-address frame format, so that the interface can
be used as a bridge port
station-pseudobridge - the interface keeps track of outgoing IP connections and performs MAC address translation similarly
to how IP masquerading works
```
multicast-enhance (e
nabled | disabled;
default: disabled)
```
With the multicast-enhance feature enabled, an AP will convert every multicast-addressed IP or IPv6 packet into multiple unicast-
addressed frames for each connected station.
This may improve link throughput and reliability since, unlike multicast frames, unicasts are acknowledged by stations and
transmitted using a higher data rate.
```
```
The 802.11 standard defines beacon interval in terms of time units (1 TU = 1.024 ms). The actual interval between
beacons will be 1 TU for every 1 ms configured.
```
```
Every AP running on the same radio (i.e. a master AP and all its 'virtual'/'slave' APs) must use the same beacon
interval.
```
```
It is important to set this value correctly to comply with local regulations and ensure interoperability with other devices.
```
```
distance is not used by the wifi-qcom-ac package. Setting distance above the actual needed value can have
detrimental effects on throughput and latency.
```
```
The 'wifi' station-bridge mode,  is incompatible with APs running the older 'wireless' package and vice versa.
```
```
qos-classifier (dscp-
high-3-bits | priority;
default: priority)
```
```
dscp-high-3-bits - interface will transmit data packets using a WMM priority equal to the value of the 3 most significant bits
of the IP DSCP field
priority - interface will transmit data packets using a WMM priority equal to that set by IP firewall or bridge filter
```
```
ssid (string; default: no
)
```
```
The name of the wireless network, aka the (E)SSID.
```
```
station-roaming (no |
yes; Default: no)
```
```
Wifi interface running in station or station-bridge mode will periodically scan for AP candidates to roam to, the weaker the signal
to AP is, the more often the scan will be performed. If an AP with a better signal is found, the station will roam to it. FT is
supported, and station will respond to BSS Transion Request if steering.wnm is enabled.
```
```
tx-chains (list of
integer 0..7)
```
```
Radio chains to use for transmitting signals. Defaults to all chains available to the corresponding radio hardware.
```
```
tx-power (integer 0..
40 )
```
```
A limit on the transmit power (in dBm) of the interface. Can not be used to set power above limits imposed by the regulatory
profile. Unset by default.
```
Datapath properties
Parameters relating to forwarding packets to and from wireless client devices.
```
Property Description
```
```
bridge (bridge interface) Bridge interface to add interface to, as a bridge port.
Virtual ('slave') interfaces are by default added to the same bridge, if any, as the corresponding master interface.
Master interfaces are not by default added to any bridge.
```
```

)
```
```
Bridge port cost to use when adding as bridge port.
```
```
bridge-horizon (none | integer;
default: none)
```
```
Bridge horizon to use when adding as bridge port.
```
```
client-isolation  (no | yes;
default: no)
```
```
Determines whether client devices connecting to this interface are (by default) isolated from others or not.
This policy can be overridden on a per-client basis using access list rules, so a an AP can have a mixture of isolated
and non-isolated clients.
Traffic from an isolated client will not be forwarded to other clients and unicast traffic from a non-isolated client will not
be forwarded to an isolated one.
```
```
interface-list (interface list;
default: no)
```
```
List to which add the interface as a member.
```
```
vlan-id (none | integer 1..
4095; default: none)
```
```
Default VLAN ID to assign to client devices connecting to this interface (only relevant to interfaces in AP mode).
When a client is assigned a VLAN ID, traffic coming from the client is automatically tagged with the ID and only
packets tagged with with this ID are forwarded to the client.
```
Security Properties
Parameters relating to authentication.
```
Property Description
```
```
802.11ac wireless chipsets do not support the dscp-high-3-bits classifier mode. For 802.11ac interfaces, please see D
SCP from priority.
```
```
802.11ac chipsets do not support this type of VLAN tagging , but they can be configured as VLAN access
ports in bridge settings.
```
authentication-types (list of wpa-psk,
wpa2-psk, wpa-eap, wpa2-eap, wpa3-psk,
owe, wpa3-eap, wpa3-eap-192)
```
Authentication types to enable on the interface.
```
```
The default value is an empty list (no authentication, an open network).
```
```
Configuring a passphrase adds to the default list the wpa2-psk authentication method (if the interface is an
AP) or both wpa-psk and wpa2-psk (if the interface is a station).
```
```
Configuring an eap-username and an eap-password adds to the default list wpa-eap and wpa2-eap
authentication methods.
```
connect-group ( string ) APs within the same connect group do not allow more than 1 client device with the same MAC address.
This is to prevent malicious authorized users from intercepting traffic intended to other users ('MacStealer'
attack) or performing a denial of service attack by spoofing the MAC address of a victim.
```
Handling of new connections with duplicate MAC addresses depends on the connect-priority of AP
interfaces involved.
```
```
By default, all APs are assigned the same connect-group.
```
connect-priority (accept-priority/hold-
priority (integers))
```
These parameters determine, how a connection is handled if the MAC address of the client device is the
same as that of another active connection to another AP.
If (accept-priority of AP2) < (hold-priority of AP1), a connection to AP2 wil cause the client to be dropped
from AP1.
If (accept-priority of AP2) = (hold-priority of AP1), a connection to AP2 will be allowed only if the MAC
address can no longer be reached via AP1.
If (accept-priority of AP2) > (hold-priority of AP1), a connection to AP2 will not be accepted.
```
```
If omitted, hold-priority is the same as accept-priority.
By default, APs, which perform user authentication, have higher priority (lower integer value), than open
APs.
```
dh-groups (list of 19, 20, 21) Identifiers of elliptic curve cryptography groups to use in SAE (WPA3) authentication.
disable-pmkid (no | yes; default: no) For interfaces in AP mode, disables inclusion of a PMKID in EAPOL frames. Disabling PMKID can cause
compatibility issues with client devices that make use of it.
```
yes - Do not include PMKID in EAPOL frames.
no  - include PMKID in EAPOL frames.
```
eap-accounting (no | yes; default: no) Send accounting information to RADIUS server for EAP-authenticated peers.
eap-anonymous-identity (string; default: no
ne)
```
Optional anonymous identity for EAP outer authentication.
```
eap-certificate-mode (dont-verify-certificate
| no-certificates | verify-certificate | verify-
certificate-with-crl; default: dont-verify-
certificate)
```
Policy for handling the TLS certificate of the RADIUS server.
```
```
verify-certificate - require server to have a valid certificate. Check that it is signed by a trusted
certificate authority.
dont-verify-certificate - Do not perform any checks on the certificate.
no-certificates - Attempt to establish the TLS tunnel by performing anonymous Diffie-Hellman key
exchange. To be used if the RADIUS server has no certificate at all.
verify-certificate-with-crl - Same as verify-certificate, but also checks if the certificate is valid by
checking the Certificate Revocation List.
```
eap-methods (list of peap, tls, ttls) EAP methods to consider for authentication. Defaults to all supported methods.
eap-password (string; default: none) Password to use, when the chosen EAP method requires one.
eap-tls-certificate (certificate; default: none) Name or id of a certificate in the device's certificate store to use, when the chosen EAP authentication
method requires one.
eap-username (string; default: none) Username to use when the chosen EAP method requires one.
```
Properties related to EAP, are only relevant to interfaces in station mode. APs delegate (passthrough) EAP authentication to the RADIUS
server.
```
encryption (list of  ccmp, ccmp-256, gcmp,
gcmp-256, tkip; default: ccmp)
```
A list of ciphers to support for encrypting unicast traffic.
```
```
Defaults to ccmp.
```

```
ft-nas-identifier (string of 2..96 hex
characters)
```
Fast BSS transition PMK-R0 key holder identifier. Default: MAC address of the interface.
```
ft-over-ds (no | yes; default: no)   Whether to enable fast BSS transitions over DS (distributed system).
ft-preserve-vlanid (no | yes )
no - when a client connects to this AP via 802.11r fast BSS transition, it is assigned a VLAN ID
according to the access and/or interface settings
yes (default) - when a client connects to this AP via 802.11r fast BSS transition, it retains the VLAN
ID, which it was assigned during initial authentication
```
The default behavior is essential when relying on a RADIUS server to assign VLAN IDs to users, since a
RADIUS server is only used for initial authentication.
```
ft-r0-key-lifetime (time interval 1s..
6w3d12h15m; Default: 600000s (~7 days))
```
Lifetime of the fast BSS transition PMK-R0 encryption key.

```
management-protection (allowed | disabled
| required)
```
Whether to use 802.11w management frame protection. Incompatible with management frame protection
in standard wireless package.
```
```
The default value depends on the value of the selected authentication type. WPA2 allows the use of
management protection, WPA3 requires it.
```
multi-passphrase-group (string) Name of /interface/wifi/security/multi-passphrase/ group that will be used. Only a single
group can be defined under the security profile.
owe-transition-interface (interface) Name or internal id of an interface whose MAC address and SSID to advertise as the matching AP when
running in OWE transition mode.
```
Required for setting up open APs that offer OWE, but also work with older devices that don't support the
standard. See configuration example below.
```
```
Take care when configuring encryption ciphers.
```
```
All client devices MUST support the group encryption cipher used by the AP to connect, and some client devices (notably, Intel® 8260) will
also fail to connect if the list of unicast ciphers includes any they don't support.
```
```
Properties related to 802.11r fast BSS transition only apply to interfaces in AP mode. WiFi interfaces in station mode do not support 802.11r.
```
```
For a client device to successfully roam between 2 APs, the APs need to be managed by the same instance of RouterOS. For information on
how to centrally manage multiple APs, see CAPsMAN
```
```
passphrase (string of up to 63 characters) The passphrase to use for PSK authentication types. Defaults to an empty string - "".
```
```
WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK authentication requires a minimum of 8 chars, while WPA3-PSK does not have
a minimum passphrase length.
```
```
sae-anti-clogging-threshold ('disabled' | int
eger; default: 5 )
```
```
Due to SAE (WPA3) associations being CPU resource intensive, overwhelming an AP with bogus
authentication requests makes for a feasible denial-of-service attack.
```
```
This parameter provides a way to mitigate such attacks by specifying a threshold of in-progress SAE
authentications, at which the AP will start requesting that client devices include a cookie bound to their
MAC address in their authentication requests. It will then only process authentication requests that contain
valid cookies.
```
```
sae-max-failure-rate ('disabled' | integer;
default: 40 )
```
```
Rate of failed SAE (WPA3) associations per minute, at which the AP will stop processing new association
requests.
```
```
sae-pwe (both | hash-to-element | hunting-
and-pecking; default: both)
```
```
Methods to support for deriving SAE password element.
```
```
wps (disabled | push-button; default: push-
button) push-button - AP will accept WPS authentication for 2 minutes after 'wps-push-button' command is
called. Physical WPS button functionality not yet implemented.
disabled - AP will not accept WPS authentication
```
Security multi-passphrase properties
/interface/wifi/security/multi-passphrase/
multi-passphrase allows the use of PPSK - private pre-shared keys. Added in 7.17beta1.
It can be used by creating an access list entry and setting multi-passphrase-group name, or by assigning the group to a security profile that the
interface uses.
The total limit of supported passphrases is 10000, the limit is shared between all interfaces. When the interface has an associated multi-passphrase group,
upon being enabled it will start caching all passphrases from the specified group, while caching is taking place, the authentication will be slower. Once
caching is completed there will be no perceptible added delay due to the use of multi-passphrase group.
If an access-list is used to apply multi-passphrase-group, the caching will start upon the first match for the group, and will continue until a match for
the passphrase is found.
If there are thousands of entries for possible passphrases under a single group - it might take a few minutes for caching to complete, depending on device
configuration and model.
```
group (string) assigning the group to a security profile or an access list, will enable use of all passphrases defined under it
```
```
passphrase (string
of up to 63
characters)
```
```
The passphrase to use for PSK authentication types. Multiple users can use the same passphrase.
```
```
Not compatible with WPA3-PSK.

4095 ; Default: )
```
```
vlan-id that will be assigned to clients using this passphrase
```
```
expires (date and
time; "YYYY-MM-
DD HH:SS"
```
```
The expiration date and time for passphrase specified in this entry, doesn't affect the whole group. Once the date is reached,
existing clients using this passphrase will be disconnected, and new clients will not be able to connect using it. If not set,
passphrase can be used indefinetly.
```
```
multi-passphrase is not supported for the WPA3-PSK authentication type.
```
```
Only supported on wifi-qcom interfaces, if wifi-qcom-ac AP has a client that uses a passphrase that has vlan-id
associated with it, the client will not be able to join.
```
```
isolation (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Determines whether the client device using this passphrase is isolated from other clients on AP.
Traffic from an isolated client will not be forwarded to other clients and unicast traffic from a non-isolated client will not be
forwarded to an isolated one.
```
```
disabled (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
Steering properties

```
Property Description
```
```
neighbor-group (string
)
```
```
When sending neighbor reports and BSS transition management requests, an AP will list all other APs within its neighbor group
as potential roaming candidates.
```
```
By default, a dynamic neighbor group is created for each set of APs with the same SSID and authentication settings.
APs operating in the 5GHz band are indicated to be preferable to ones operating in the 2.4GHz band.

Default: none)
```
```
This property is only effective for cards based on Atheros chipset.
```
```
allow-sharedkey (yes | no; Default: no) Allow WEP Shared Key clients to connect. Note that no authentication is done

just accepted at once (if access list allows that)
```
```
ampdu-priorities (list of integer [0..7]; Default: 0 ) Frame priorities for which AMPDU sending (aggregating frames and sending
using block acknowledgment) should get negotiated and used. Using AMPDUs
will increase throughput, but may increase latency, therefore, may not be

enabled only for best-effort traffic.
```
```
amsdu-limit (integer [0..8192]; Default: 8192 ) Max AMSDU that device is allowed to prepare when negotiated. AMSDU
aggregation may significantly increase throughput especially for small frames,
but may increase latency in case of packet loss due to retransmission of
aggregated frame. Sending and receiving AMSDUs will also increase CPU
usage.
```
```
amsdu-threshold (integer [0..8192]; Default: 8192 ) Max frame size to allow including in AMSDU.
```
```

rxa-txb - use antenna 'b' for transmitting, antenna 'a' for receiving
```
```
area (string; Default: ) Identifies group of wireless networks. This value is announced by AP, and can
be matched in connect-list by area-prefix. This is a proprietary extension.
```
```

```
```
arp-timeout (auto | integer; Default: auto) ARP timeout is time how long ARP record is kept in ARP table after no packets
are received from IP. Value auto equals to the value of arp-timeout in /ip settings
, default is 30s
```
band (2ghz-b | 2ghz-b/g | 2ghz-b/g/n | 2ghz-onlyg | 2ghz-onlyn | 5ghz-

```
This property has effect only in AP modes, and when value of rate-set is
configured.
```
bridge-mode (disabled | enabled; Default: enabled) Allows to use station-bridge mode. Read more >>
burst-time (integer | disabled; Default: disabled) Time in microseconds which will be used to send data without stopping. Note
that no other wireless cards in that network will be able to transmit data during
burst-time microseconds. This setting is available only for AR5000, AR5001X,
and AR5001X+ chipset based cards.
channel-width (20/40/80/160mhz-Ceeeeeee | 20/40/80/160mhz-

40mhz-turbo | 20mhz | 10mhz | 5mhz; Default: 20mhz)
```
Use of extension channels (e.g. Ce, eC etc) allows additional 20MHz extension
channels and if it should be located below or above the control (main) channel.
Extension channel allows 802.11n devices to use up to 40MHz (802.11ac up to
160MHz) of spectrum in total thus increasing max throughput. Channel widths
with XX and XXXX extensions automatically scan for a less crowded control
channel frequency based on the number of concurrent devices running in every
frequency and chooses the “C” - Control channel frequency automatically.
```

default-forwarding (yes | no; Default: yes) This is the value of forwarding for clients that do not match any entry in the acce
ss-list
disable-running-check (yes | no; Default: no) When set to yes interface will always have running flag. If value is set to no', the
router determines whether the card is up and running - for AP one or more
clients have to be registered to it, for station, it should be connected to an AP.
disabled (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether interface is disabled
disconnect-timeout (time [0s..15s]; Default: 3s) This interval is measured from third sending failure on the lowest data rate. At
this point 3 * (hw-retries + 1) frame transmits on the lowest data rate had failed.
During disconnect-timeout packet transmission will be retried with on-fail-retry-
time interval. If no frame can be transmitted successfully during disconnect-
timeout, the connection is closed, and this event is logged as "extensive data
loss". Successful frame transmission resets this timer.
distance (integer | dynamic | indoors; Default: dynamic) How long to wait for confirmation of unicast frames (ACKs) before considering
transmission unsuccessful, or in short ACK-Timeout. Distance value has these
behaviors:
```
Dynamic - causes AP to detect and use the smallest timeout that works
with all connected clients.
Indoor - uses the default ACK timeout value that the hardware chip
manufacturer has set.
Number - uses the input value in formula: ACK-timeout = ((distance *
1000) + 299) / 300 us;
```
```
Acknowledgments are not used in Nstreme/NV2 protocols.
```
frame-lifetime (integer [0..4294967295]; Default: 0 ) Discard frames that have been queued for sending longer than frame-lifetime.
By default, when value of this property is 0 , frames are discarded only after
connection is closed.
frequency (integer [0..4294967295]; Default: ) Channel frequency value in MHz on which AP will operate.
Allowed values depend on the selected band, and are restricted by country
setting and wireless card capabilities. This setting has no effect if interface is in
any of station modes, or in wds-slave mode, or if DFS is active.
```
Note: If using mode "superchannel", any frequency supported by the card will
be accepted, but on the RouterOS client, any non-standard frequency must be
configured in the scan-list, otherwise it will not be scanning in non-standard
range. In Winbox, scanlist frequencies are in bold, any other frequency means
the clients will need scan-list configured.
```
frequency-mode (manual-txpower | regulatory-domain | superchannel;
Default: regulatory_domain)
```
Three frequency modes are available:
```
```
regulatory-domain - Limit available channels and maximum transmit power
for each channel according to the value of country
manual-txpower - Same as above, but do not limit maximum transmit
power.
superchannel - Conformance Testing Mode. Allow all channels supported
by the card.
```
```
List of available channels for each band can be seen in /interface wireless info
allowed-channels. This mode allows you to test wireless channels outside the
default scan-list and/or regulatory domain. This mode should only be used in
controlled environments, or if you have special permission to use it in your
region. Before v4.3 this was called Custom Frequency Upgrade, or
Superchannel. Since RouterOS v4.3 this mode is available without special key
upgrades to all installations.
```
frequency-offset (integer [-2147483648..2147483647]; Default: 0 ) Allows to specify offset if the used wireless card operates at a different
frequency than is shown in RouterOS, in case a frequency converter is used in
the card. So if your card works at 4000MHz but RouterOS shows 5000MHz, set
offset to 1000MHz and it will be displayed correctly. The value is in MHz and
can be positive or negative.
guard-interval (any | long; Default: any) Whether to allow use of short guard interval (refer to 802.11n MCS specification
to see how this may affect throughput). "any" will use either short or long,
depending on data rate, "long" will use long.
hide-ssid (yes | no; Default: no)
yes - AP does not include SSID in the beacon frames, and does not reply
to probe requests that have broadcast SSID.
no - AP includes SSID in the beacon frames, and replies to probe requests
that have broadcast SSID.
```
This property has an effect only in AP mode. Setting it to yes can remove this
network from the list of wireless networks that are shown by some client
software. Changing this setting does not improve the security of the wireless
network, because SSID is included in other frames sent by the AP.

```
hw-fragmentation-threshold (integer[256..3000] | disabled; Default: 0 ) Specifies maximum fragment size in bytes when transmitted over the wireless
medium. 802.11 standard packet (MSDU in 802.11 terminologies)
fragmentation allows packets to be fragmented before transmitting over a
wireless medium to increase the probability of successful transmission (only
fragments that did not transmit correctly are retransmitted). Note that
transmission of a fragmented packet is less efficient than transmitting
unfragmented packet because of protocol overhead and increased resource
usage at both - transmitting and receiving party.
hw-protection-mode (cts-to-self | none | rts-cts; Default: none) Frame protection support property read more >>
hw-protection-threshold (integer [0..65535]; Default: 0 ) Frame protection support property read more >>
hw-retries (integer [0..15]; Default: 7 ) Number of times sending frame is retried without considering it a transmission
failure. Data-rate is decreased upon failure and the frame is sent again. Three
sequential failures on the lowest supported rate suspend transmission to this
destination for the duration of on-fail-retry-time. After that, the frame is sent
again. The frame is being retransmitted until transmission success, or until the
client is disconnected after disconnect-timeout. The frame can be discarded
during this time if frame-lifetime is exceeded.
installation (any | indoor | outdoor; Default: any) Adjusts scan-list to use indoor, outdoor or all frequencies for the country that is
set.
interworking-profile (enabled | disabled; Default: disabled)
keepalive-frames (enabled | disabled; Default: enabled) Applies only if wireless interface is in mode=ap-bridge. If a client has not
communicated for around 20 seconds, AP sends a "keepalive-frame".
Note, disabling the feature can lead to "ghost" clients in registration-table.
l2mtu (integer [0..65536]; Default: 1600 )
mac-address (MAC; Default: )
master-interface (string; Default: ) Name of wireless interface that has virtual-ap capability. Virtual AP interface will
only work if master interface is in ap-bridge, bridge, station or wds-slave mode.
This property is only for virtual AP interfaces.
max-station-count (integer [1..2007]; Default: 2007 ) Maximum number of associated clients. WDS links also count toward this limit.
mode (station | station-wds | ap-bridge | bridge | alignment-only |
nstreme-dual-slave | wds-slave | station-pseudobridge | station-
pseudobridge-clone | station-bridge; Default: station)
```
Selection between different station and access point (AP) modes.
Station modes:
```
```
station - Basic station mode. Find and connect to acceptable AP.
station-wds - Same as station, but create WDS link with AP, using
proprietary extension. AP configuration has to allow WDS links with this
device. Note that this mode does not use entries in wds.
station-pseudobridge - Same as station, but additionally perform MAC
address translation of all traffic. Allows interface to be bridged.
station-pseudobridge-clone - Same as station-pseudobridge, but use statio
n-bridge-clone-mac address to connect to AP.
station-bridge - Provides support for transparent protocol-independent L2
bridging on the station device. RouterOS AP accepts clients in station-
bridge mode when enabled using bridge-mode parameter. In this mode,
the AP maintains a forwarding table with information on which MAC
addresses are reachable over which station device. Only works with
RouterOS APs. With station-bridge mode, it is not possible to connect to
CAPsMAN controlled CAP.
```
```
AP modes:
```
```
ap-bridge - Basic access point mode.
bridge - Same as ap-bridge, but limited to one associated client.
wds-slave - Same as ap-bridge, but scan for AP with the same ssid and
establishes WDS link. If this link is lost or cannot be established, then
continue scanning. If dfs-mode is radar-detect, then APs with enabled hide-
ssid will not be found during scanning.
```
```
Special modes:
```
```
alignment-only - Put the interface in a continuous transmit mode that is
used for aiming the remote antenna.
nstreme-dual-slave - allow this interface to be used in nstreme-dual setup.
```
```
MAC address translation in pseudobridge modes works by inspecting packets
and building a table of corresponding IP and MAC addresses. All packets are
sent to AP with the MAC address used by pseudobridge, and MAC addresses
of received packets are restored from the address translation table. There is a
single entry in the address translation table for all non-IP packets, hence more
than one host in the bridged network cannot reliably use non-IP protocols. Note:
Currently IPv6 doesn't work over Pseudobridge
```
mtu (integer [0..65536]; Default: 1500 )
multicast-buffering (disabled | enabled; Default: enabled) For a client that has power saving, buffer multicast packets until next beacon
time. A client should wake up to receive a beacon, by receiving beacon it sees
that there are multicast packets pending, and it should wait for multicast
packets to be sent.
```
The 'wireless' station-bridge mode,  is incompatible with APs running
the newer 'wifi' package and vice versa.
```
multicast-helper (default | disabled | full; Default: default) When set to full, multicast packets will be sent with a unicast destination MAC
address, resolving multicast problem on the wireless link. This option should be
enabled only on the access point, clients should be configured in station-bridge
mode. Available starting from v5.15.
```
disabled - disables the helper and sends multicast packets with multicast
destination MAC addresses
dhcp - dhcp packet mac addresses are changed to unicast mac addresses
prior to sending them out
full - all multicast packet mac address are changed to unicast mac
addresses prior to sending them out
default - default choice that currently is set to dhcp. Value can be changed
in future releases.
```
name (string; Default: ) name of the interface
noise-floor-threshold (default | integer [-128..127]; Default: default) For advanced use only, as it can badly affect the performance of the interface. It
is possible to manually set noise floor threshold value. By default, it is
dynamically calculated. This property also affects received signal strength. This
property is only effective on non-AC chips.
nv2-cell-radius (integer [10..200]; Default: 30 ) Setting affects the size of contention time slot that AP allocates for clients to
initiate connection and also size of time slots used for estimating distance to
client. When setting is too small, clients that are farther away may have trouble
connecting and/or disconnect with "ranging timeout" error. Although during
normal operation the effect of this setting should be negligible, in order to
maintain maximum performance, it is advised to not increase this setting if not
necessary, so AP is not reserving time that is actually never used, but instead
allocates it for actual data transfer.
```
on AP: distance to farthest client in km
on station: no effect
```
nv2-noise-floor-offset (default | integer [0..20]; Default: default)
nv2-preshared-key (string; Default: )
nv2-qos (default | frame-priority; Default: default) Sets the packet priority mechanism, firstly data from high priority queue is sent,
then lower queue priority data until 0 queue priority is reached. When link is full
with high priority queue data, lower priority data is not sent. Use it very carefully,
setting works on AP
```
frame-priority - manual setting that can be tuned with Mangle rules.
default - default setting where small packets receive priority for best latency
```
nv2-queue-count (integer [2..8]; Default: 2 )
nv2-security (disabled | enabled; Default: disabled)
on-fail-retry-time (time [100ms..1s]; Default: 100ms) After third sending failure on the lowest data rate, wait for specified time interval
before retrying.
periodic-calibration (default | disabled | enabled; Default: default) Setting default enables periodic calibration if info default-periodic-calibration
property is enabled. Value of that property depends on the type of wireless
card. This property is only effective for cards based on Atheros chipset.
periodic-calibration-interval (integer [1..10000]; Default: 60 ) This property is only effective for cards based on Atheros chipset.
preamble-mode (both | long | short; Default: both) Short preamble mode is an option of 802.11b standard that reduces per-frame
overhead.
```
On AP:
long - Do not use short preamble.
short - Announce short preamble capability. Do not accept
connections from clients that do not have this capability.
both - Announce short preamble capability.
On station:
long - do not use short preamble.
short - do not connect to AP if it does not support short preamble.
both - Use short preamble if AP supports it.
```
prism-cardtype (100mW | 200mW | 30mW; Default: ) Specify type of the installed Prism wireless card.
proprietary-extensions (post-2.9.25 | pre-2.9.25; Default: post-2.9.25) RouterOS includes proprietary information in an information element of
management frames. This parameter controls how this information is included.
```
pre-2.9.25 - This is older method. It can interoperate with newer versions
of RouterOS. This method is incompatible with some clients, for example,
Centrino based ones.
post-2.9.25 - This uses standardized way of including vendor specific
information, that is compatible with newer wireless clients.
```
radio-name (string; Default: MAC address of an interface) Descriptive name of the device, that is shown in registration table entries on the
remote devices. This is a proprietary extension.
rate-selection (advanced | legacy; Default: advanced) Starting from v5.9 default value is advanced since legacy mode was inefficient.
rate-set (configured | default; Default: default) Two options are available:
```
default - default basic and supported rate sets are used. Values from basic-
rates and supported-rates parameters have no effect.
configured - use values from basic-rates, supported-rates, basic-mcs, mcs.
Read more >>.
```
rx-chains (list of integer [0..3]; Default: 0 ) Which antennas to use for receive. In current MikroTik routers, both RX and TX
chain must be enabled, for the chain to be enabled.
scan-list
(Comma separated list of frequencies and frequency ranges | default.
Since v6.35 (wireless-rep) type also support range:step option;
Default: default)
```
The default value is all channels from selected band that are supported by card
and allowed by the country and frequency-mode settings (this list can be seen
in info). For default scan list in 5ghz band channels are taken with 20MHz step,
in 5ghz-turbo band - with 40MHz step, for all other bands - with 5MHz step. If sc
an-list is specified manually, then all matching channels are taken. (Example: sc
an-list=default,5200-5245,2412-2427 - This will use the default value of scan list
for current band, and add to it supported frequencies from 5200-5245 or 2412-
2427 range.)
```
```
Since RouterOS v6.0 with Winbox or Webfig, for inputting of multiple
frequencies, add each frequency or range of frequencies into separate multiple
scan-lists. Using a comma to separate frequencies is no longer supported in
Winbox/Webfig since v6.0.
```
```
Since RouterOS v6.35 (wireless-rep) scan-list support step feature where it is
possible to manually specify the scan step. Example: scan-list=5500-5600:20
will generate such scan-list values 5500,5520,5540,5560,5580,5600
```
security-profile (string; Default: default) Name of profile from security-profiles
secondary-channel (integer; Default: "") Specifies secondary channel, required to enable 80+80MHz transmission. To
disable 80+80MHz functionality, set secondary-channel to "" or unset the value
via CLI/GUI.
ssid (string (0..32 chars); Default: value of system/identity) SSID (service set identifier) is a name that identifies wireless network.
skip-dfs-channels (string | 10min-cac | all | disabled; Default: disabled) These values are used to skip all DFS channels or specifically skip DFS CAC
channels in range 5600-5650MHz which detection could go up to 10min.
station-bridge-clone-mac (MAC; Default: ) This property has effect only in the station-pseudobridge-clone mode.
```
Use this MAC address when connection to AP. If this value is 00:00:00:00:00:00
, station will initially use MAC address of the wireless interface.
As soon as packet with MAC address of another device needs to be
transmitted, station will reconnect to AP using that address.
```
station-roaming (disabled | enabled; Default: disabled) Station Roaming feature is available only for 802.11 wireless protocol and only
for station modes. Read more >>
supported-rates-a/g (list of rates [12Mbps | 18Mbps | 24Mbps |
36Mbps | 48Mbps | 54Mbps | 6Mbps | 9Mbps]; Default: 6Mbps;
9Mbps; 12Mbps; 18Mbps; 24Mbps; 36Mbps; 48Mbps; 54Mbps)
```
List of supported rates, used for all bands except 2ghz-b.
```
supported-rates-b (list of rates [11Mbps | 1Mbps | 2Mbps | 5.5Mbps];
Default: 1Mbps; 2Mbps; 5.5Mbps; 11Mbps)
```
List of supported rates, used for 2ghz-b, 2ghz-b/g and 2ghz-b/g/n bands. Two
devices will communicate only using rates that are supported by both devices.
This property has effect only when value of rate-set is configured.
```
tdma-period-size (integer [1..10]; Default: 2 ) Specifies TDMA period in milliseconds. It could help on the longer distance
links, it could slightly increase bandwidth, while latency is increased too.
tx-chains (list of integer [0..3]; Default: 0 ) Which antennas to use for transmitting. In current MikroTik routers, both RX
and TX chain must be enabled, for the chain to be enabled.
tx-power (integer [-30..40]; Default: ) For 802.11ac wireless interface it's total power but for 802.11a/b/g/n it's power
per chain.
tx-power-mode (default, card-rates, all-rates-fixed, manual-table;
Default: default)
```
sets up tx-power mode for wireless card
```
```
default - use values stored in the card
all-rates-fixed - use same transmit power for all data rates. Can damage
the card if transmit power is set above rated value of the card for used rate.
manual-table - define transmit power for each rate separately. Can
damage the card if transmit power is set above rated value of the card for
used rate.
card-rates - use transmit power calculated for each rate based on value of t
x-power parameter. Legacy mode only compatible with currently
discontinued products.
```
update-stats-interval (; Default: ) How often to request update of signals strength and ccq values from clients.
Access to registration-table also triggers update of these values.
This is proprietary extension.
vht-basic-mcs (none | MCS 0-7 | MCS 0-8 | MCS 0-9; Default: MCS 0-
7 )
```
Modulation and Coding Schemes that every connecting client must support.
Refer to 802.11ac for MCS specification.
```
```
You can set MCS interval for each of Spatial Stream
```
```
none - will not use selected Spatial Stream
MCS 0-7 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-7
MCS 0-8 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-8
MCS 0-9 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-9
```
vht-supported-mcs (none | MCS 0-7 | MCS 0-8 | MCS 0-9; Default: M
CS 0-9)
```
Modulation and Coding Schemes that this device advertises as supported.
Refer to 802.11ac for MCS specification.
```
```
You can set MCS interval for each of Spatial Stream
```
```
none - will not use selected Spatial Stream
MCS 0-7 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-7
MCS 0-8 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-8
MCS 0-9 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-9
```
wds-cost-range (start [-end] integer[1..200000000]; Default: 50-150) Bridge port cost of WDS links are automatically adjusted, depending on
measured link throughput. Port cost is recalculated and adjusted every 5
seconds if it has changed by more than 10%, or if more than 20 seconds have
passed since the last adjustment.
Setting this property to 0 disables automatic cost adjustment.
Automatic adjustment does not work for WDS links that are manually configured
as a bridge port.
wds-default-bridge (string | none; Default: none) When WDS link is established and status of the wds interface becomes running,
it will be added as a bridge port to the bridge interface specified by this
property. When WDS link is lost, wds interface is removed from the bridge. If
wds interface is already included in a bridge setup when WDS link becomes
active, it will not be added to bridge specified by , and will (needs editing)
wds-default-cost (integer [1..200000000]; Default: 100 ) Initial bridge port cost of the WDS links.
wds-ignore-ssid (yes | no; Default: no) By default, WDS link between two APs can be created only when they work on
the same frequency and have the same SSID value. If this property is set to yes,
then SSID of the remote AP will not be checked. This property has no effect on
connections from clients in station-wds mode. It also does not work if wds-mode
is static-mesh or dynamic-mesh.
wds-mode (disabled | dynamic | dynamic-mesh | static | static-mesh;
Default: disabled)
```
Controls how WDS links with other devices (APs and clients in station-wds
mode) are established.
```
```
disabled does not allow WDS links.
static only allows WDS links that are manually configured in WDS
dynamic also allows WDS links with devices that are not configured in
WDS, by creating required entries dynamically. Such dynamic WDS
entries are removed automatically after the connection with the other AP is
lost.
```
```
-mesh modes use different (better) method for establishing link between AP,
that is not compatible with APs in non-mesh mode. This method avoids one-
sided WDS links that are created only by one of the two APs. Such links cannot
pass any data.When AP or station is establishing WDS connection with another
AP, it uses connect-list to check whether this connection is allowed. If station in
station-wds mode is establishing connection with AP, AP uses access-list to
check whether this connection is allowed.If mode is station-wds, then this
property has no effect.
```
wireless-protocol (802.11 | any | nstreme | nv2 | nv2-nstreme | nv2-
nstreme-802.11 | unspecified; Default: any)
```
Specifies protocol used on wireless interface;
```
```
unspecified - protocol mode used on previous RouterOS versions (v3.x, v4.
x). Nstreme is enabled by old enable-nstreme setting, Nv2 configuration is
not possible.
any : on AP - regular 802.11 Access Point or Nstreme Access Point; on
station - selects Access Point without specific sequence, it could be
changed by connect-list rules.
nstreme - enables Nstreme protocol (the same as old enable-nstreme
setting).
nv2 - enables Nv2 protocol.
nv2 nstreme : on AP - uses first wireless-protocol setting, always Nv2; on
station - searches for Nv2 Access Point, then for Nstreme Access Point.
nv2 nstreme 802.11 - on AP - uses first wireless-protocol setting, always
Nv2; on station - searches for Nv2 Access Point, then for Nstreme Access
Point, then for regular 802.11 Access Point.
```
```
Warning! Nv2 doesn't have support for Virtual AP
```
wmm-support (disabled | enabled | required; Default: disabled) Specifies whether to enable WMM.  Only applies to bands B and G. Other
bands will have it enabled regardless of this setting

Frame protection support (RTS/CTS)
802.11 standard provides means to protect the transmission against other device transmission by using RTS/CTS protocol. Frame protection helps to fight
"hidden node" problem. There are several types of protection:
```
RTS/CTS based protection - device willing to send frame at first sends RequestToSend frame and waits for ClearToSend frame from intended
destination. By "seeing" RTS or CTS frame 802.11 compliant devices know that somebody is about to transmit and therefore do not initiate
transmission themselves
"CTS to self" based protection - device willing to send frame sends CTS frame "to itself". As in RTS/CTS protocol every 802.11 compliant device
receiving this frame know not to transmit. "CTS to self" based protection has less overhead, but it must be taken into account that this only
protects against devices receiving CTS frame (e.g. if there are 2 "hidden" stations, there is no use for them to use "CTS to self" protection,
because they will not be able to receive CTS sent by other station - in this case stations must use RTS/CTS so that other station knows not to
transmit by seeing CTS transmitted by AP).
```
Protection mode is controlled by hw-protection-mode setting of wireless interface. Possible values: none - for no protection (default), rts-cts for RTS/CTS
based protection or cts-to-self for "CTS to self" based protection.
Frame size threshold at which protection should be used is controlled by hw-protection-threshold setting of wireless interface.
For example, to enable "CTS-to-self" based frame protection on AP for all frames, not depending on size, use command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> set 0 hw-protection-mode=cts-to-self hw-protection-threshold=0
```
To enable RTS/CTS based protection on client use command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> set 0 hw-protection-mode=rts-cts hw-protection-threshold=0
```
Nv2
MikroTik has developed a new wireless protocol based on TDMA technology (Time Division Multiple Access) - (Nstreme version 2). See the Nv2
documentation: NV2
TDMA is a channel access method for shared medium networks. It allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into
different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using his own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the
same transmission medium (e.g. radio frequency channel) while using only a part of its channel capacity.
The most important benefits of Nv2 are:
```
Increased speed
More client connections in PTM environments
Lower latency
No distance limitations
No penalty for long distances
```
Nv2 protocol limit is 511 clients.
Warning: Nv2 doesn't have support for Virtual AP
Nv2 Troubleshooting
Increase throughput on long distance with tdma-period-size. In Every "period", the Access Point leaves part of the time unused for data transmission
(which is equal to round trip time - the time in which the frame can be sent and received from the client), it is used to ensure that client could receive the
last frame from Access Point, before sending its own packets to it. The longer the distance, the longer the period is unused.
For example, the distance between Access Point and client is 30km. Frame is sent in 100us one direction, respectively round-trip-time is ~200us. tdma-
period-size default value is 2ms, it means 10% of the time is unused. When tdma-period-size is increased to 4ms, only 5% of time is unused. For 60km
wireless link, round-trip-time is 400ms, unused time is 20% for default tdma-period-size 2ms, and 10% for 4ms. Bigger tdma-period-size value increases
latency on the link.
Access List
Sub-menu: /interface wireless access-list
Access list is used by access point to restrict allowed connections from other devices, and to control connection parameters.
Access list rules are processed one by one until matching rule is found. Then the action in the matching rule is executed. If action specifies that client
should be accepted, client is accepted, potentially overriding it's default connection parameters with ones specified in access list rule.
There are the following parameters for access list rules:
```
client matching parameters:
address - MAC address of the client
interface - optional interface to compare with the interface to which client actually connects to
time - time of day and days when rule matches
signal-range - range in which client signal must fit for the rule to match
allow-signal-out-of-range - option which permits client's signal to be out of the range always or for some time interval
connection parameters:
ap-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to client
client-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to AP (applies to RouterOS clients only)
private-passphrase - PSK passphrase to use for this client if some PSK authentication algorithm is used
vlan-mode - VLAN tagging mode specifies if traffic coming from client should get tagged (and untagged when going to client).
vlan-id - VLAN ID to use if doing VLAN tagging
```
Operation:
```
Access list rules are checked sequentially.
Disabled rules are always ignored.
Only the first matching rule is applied.
If there are no matching rules for the remote connection, then the default values from the wireless interface configuration are used.
If remote device is matched by rule that has authentication=no value, the connection from that remote device is rejected.
```
Warning: If there is no entry in ACL about client which connects to AP (wireless,debug wlan2: A0:0B:BA:D7:4D:B2 not in local ACL, by default accept),
then ACL for this client is ignored during all connection time.
For example, if client's signal during connection is -41 and we have ACL rule
```
/interface/wireless/access-list
add authentication=yes forwarding=yes interface=wlan2 signal-range=-55..0
```
Then the connection is matched to the ACL rule, but if signal drops below -55, client will not be disconnected.
Please note that if "default-authentication=yes" is set on the wireless interface, clients will be able to join even if there are no matching access-list entries.
To make it work correctly it is required that client is matched by any of ACL rules.
If we modify ACL rules in the previous example to:
```
/interface/wireless/access-list
add interface=wlan2 signal-range=-55..0
add authentication=no forwarding=no interface=wlan2 signal-range=-120..-56
```
Then if signal drops to -56, client will be disconnected.

Connect List
Sub-menu: /interface wireless connect-list
connect-list is used to assign priority and security settings to connections with remote access points, and to restrict allowed connections. connect-list is an
ordered list of rules. Each rule in connect-list is attached to specific wireless interface, specified in the interfaceproperty of that rule (this is unlike access
-list, where rules can apply to all interfaces). Rule can match MAC address of remote access point, it's signal strength and many other parameters.
Operation:
```
connect-list rules are always checked sequentially, starting from the first.
disabled rules are always ignored.
Only the first matching rule is applied.
If SSID or exact wireless protocol is provided in the wireless interface configuration Connect List SSIDs or wireless protocols not covered by
wireless interface configuration are ignored.
If connect-list does not have any rule that matches remote access point, then the default values from the wireless interface configuration are used.
If access point is matched by rule that has connect=no value, connection with this access point will not be attempted.
If access point is matched by rule that has connect=yes value, connection with this access point will be attempted.
In station mode, if several remote access points are matched by connect list rules with connect=yes value, connection will be attempted
with access point that is matched by rule higher in the connect-list.
If no remote access points are matched by connect-list rules with connect=yes value, then value of default-authentication interface
property determines whether station will attempt to connect to any access point. If default-authentication=yes, station will choose access
point with best signal and compatible security.
In access point mode, connect-list is checked before establishing WDS link with remote device. If access point is not matched by any rule in the
connect list, then the value of default-authentication determines whether WDS link will be established.

Wireless hardware table
Warning: You must follow to regulatory domain requirements in your country. If you are allowed to use other frequencies, note that Antenna Gain and
Transmit Power may decrease depending on board and frequency. Devices are calibrated only for regulatory frequencies, use non standard frequencies at
your own risk. The list only specifies frequencies accepted by the wireless chip, these frequencies might not always work due to antenna that is built into
the product, device design, filters and other factors. USE STRICTLY AT YOUR OWN RISK
It is possible to deduce supported channel width from the product page, to do so you need to check the following parameters: number of chains and the ma
x data rate. Once you know these parameters, you need to check the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) table, for example, here: https://mcsindex.
com/.
If we take hAP ac, as an example, we can see that number of chains is 3, and the max data rate is 1300 in the MCS table. In the MCS table we need to
find entry for 3 spatial streams - chains, and the respective data rate, which in this case shows us that 80MHz is the maximum supported channel width.

Overview
Advanced Channels feature provides extended opportunities in wireless interface configuration:
```
scan-list that covers multiple bands and channel widths;
non-standard channel center frequencies (specified with KHz granularity) for hardware that allows that;
non-standard channel widths (specified with KHz granularity) for hardware that allows that.
```
Hardware support
Non standard center frequency and width channels can only be used with interfaces that support it.
Currently only Atheros AR92xx based chips support non-standard center frequencies and widths with the following ranges:
```
center frequency range: 2200MHz-2500MHz with step 0.5MHz (500KHz), width range: 2.5MHz-30MHz width step 0.5MHz (500KHz);
center frequency range: 4800MHz-6100MHz with step 0.5MHz (500KHz), width range: 2.5MHz-30MHz width step 0.5MHz (500KHz);
```
AR93xx doesn't support this feature
Configuring Advanced Channels
Advanced Channels are configured in interface wireless channels menu. This menu contains ordered list of user-defined channels that can be grouped by
means of list property. Channels have the following properties:
```
name - name by which this channel can be referred to. If name is not specified when adding channel, it will be automatically generated from
channel frequency and width;
list - name of list this channel is part of. Lists can be used to group channels;
frequency - channel center frequency in MHz, allowing to specify fractional MHz part, e.g. 5181.5;
width - channel width in MHz, allowing to specify fractional MHz part, e.g. 14.5;
band - defines default set of data rates when using this channel;
extension-channel - specifies placement of 11n extension channel.
```
Using Advanced Channels
In order to use Advanced Channels in wireless interface configuration, several interface settings accept channel names or list names as arguments. It is
possible to configure interface with channel that interface does not support. In this case interface will not become operational. It is sole responsibility of
administrator to configure channels in proper way.
frequency
To use particular Advanced Channel for wireless interface (applies to modes that make use of interface frequency setting) specify channel name in
interface frequency setting. For example, to configure interface to operate with center frequency 5500MHz and channel width 14MHz, use the following
commands:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add name=MYCHAN frequency=5500 width=14 band=5ghz-onlyn
list=MYLIST
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> set wlan1 frequency=MYCHAN
```
scan-list
Interface scan-list is used in multiple modes that either gather information for list of channels (like interactive scan command) or selects channel to work on
(like any of station modes or AP modes performing DFS). Interface scan-list can be configured with comma-separated list of the following items:
```
default - default .11 channel list for given country and interface band and channel width;
numeric frequency ranges in MHz;
```
```
Advanced Channel, referred to by name;
Advanced Channel list, referred to by list name.
```
For example, to configure interface to scan 5180MHz, 5200MHz and 5220MHz at first using channel width 20MHz and then using channel width 10MHz,
the following commands can be issued:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5180 width=20 band=5ghz-a list=20MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5200 width=20 band=5ghz-a list=20MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5220 width=20 band=5ghz-a list=20MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5180 width=10 band=5ghz-a list=10MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5200 width=10 band=5ghz-a list=10MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> channels add frequency=5220 width=10 band=5ghz-a list=10MHz-list
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> set wlan1 scan-list=20MHz-list,10MHz-list
```
Nstreme
Sub-menu: /interface wireless nstreme
This menu allows to switch a wireless card to the nstreme mode. In this case the card will work only with nstreme clients.

```
```
The method how to combine frames. A number of frames may be combined into a bigger one to reduce the amount of
protocol overhead (and thus increase speed). The card is not waiting for frames, but in case a number of packets are
queued for transmitting, they can be combined. There are several methods of framing:
```
```
none - do nothing special, do not combine packets (framing is disabled)
best-fit - put as many packets as possible in one frame, until the framer-limit limit is met, but do not fragment
packets
exact-size - put as many packets as possible in one frame, until the framer-limit limit is met, even if fragmentation
will be needed (best performance)
dynamic-size - choose the best frame size dynamically
```
```
name (string) Name of an interface, to which setting will be applied. Read only.
```
Note: The settings here (except for enabling nstreme) are relevant only on Access Point, they are ignored for client devices! The client automatically
adapts to the AP settings.
WDS for Nstreme protocol requires using station-wds mode on one of the peers. Configurations with WDS between AP modes (bridge and ap-bridge) will
not work.
Nstreme Dual
Sub-menu: /interface wireless nstreme-dual
Two radios in nstreme-dual-slave mode can be grouped together to make nstreme2 Point-to-Point connection. To put wireless interfaces into a nstreme2
group, you should set their mode to nstreme-dual-slave. Many parameters from /interface wireless menu are ignored, using the nstreme2, except:
```

```
```
tdma-timing-offset is proportional to distance and is approximately two times the propagation delay. AP measures this so that it can tell
clients what offset to use for their transmissions - clients then subtract this offset from their target transmission time such that
propagation delay is accounted for and transmission arrives at AP when expected. You may occasionally see small negative value (like
few usecs) there for close range clients because of additional unaccounted delay that may be produced in transmitter or receiver
hardware that varies from chipset to chipset.
```
```
tdma-tx-
size (integ
er)
```
```
Value in bytes that specifies the size of data unit whose loss can be detected (data unit over which CRC is calculated) sent by device.
In general - the bigger the better, because overhead is less. On the other hand, small value in this setting can not always be
considered a signal that connection is poor - if device does not have enough pending data that would enable it to use bigger data units
(e.g. if you are just pinging over link), this value will not go up.

Security Profiles
Sub-menu: /interface wireless security-profiles
Security profiles are configured under the /interface wireless security-profiles path in the console, or in the "Security Profiles" tab of the "Wireless" window
in the WinBox. Security profiles are referenced by the Wireless interface security-profile property and security-profile property of Connect Lists.
Basic properties
```
Property Description
```
```
mode (none | static-keys-
optional | static-keys-
required | dynamic-keys;
Default: none)
```
```
Encryption mode for the security profile.
```
```
none - Encryption is not used. Encrypted frames are not accepted.
static-keys-required - WEP mode. Do not accept and do not send unencrypted frames. Station in static-keys-
required mode will not connect to an Access Point in static-keys-optional mode.
static-keys-optional - WEP mode. Support encryption and decryption, but allow also to receive and send
unencrypted frames. Device will send unencrypted frames if encryption algorithm is specified as none. Station in st
atic-keys-optional mode will not connect to an Access Point in static-keys-required mode. See also: static-sta-
private-algo, static-transmit-key.
dynamic-keys - WPA mode.
```
```
name (text; Default: ) Name of the security profile
```
WPA properties
These properties have effect only when mode is set to dynamic-keys.
```
Property Description
```
```
authentication-types (wpa-
psk | wpa2-psk | wpa-eap |
wpa2-eap; Default: )
```
```
Set of supported authentication types, multiple values can be selected. Access Point will advertise supported
authentication types, and client will connect to Access Point only if it supports any of the advertised authentication
types.
```
```
disable-pmkid (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Whether to include PMKID into the EAPOL frame sent out by the Access Point. Disabling PMKID can cause
compatibility issues with devices that use the PMKID to connect to an Access Point.
```
```
yes - removes PMKID from EAPOL frames (improves security, reduces compatibility).
no - includes PMKID into EAPOL frames (reduces security, improves compatibility).
```
```
This property only has effect on Access Points.
```
```
unicast-ciphers (tkip | aes-
ccm; Default: aes-ccm)
```
```
Access Point advertises that it supports specified ciphers, multiple values can be selected. Client attempts connection
only to Access Points that supports at least one of the specified ciphers. One of the ciphers will be used to encrypt
unicast frames that are sent between Access Point and Station.
```
```
group-ciphers (tkip | aes-
ccm; Default: aes-ccm)
```
```
Access Point advertises one of these ciphers, multiple values can be selected. Access Point uses it to encrypt all
broadcast and multicast frames. Client attempts connection only to Access Points that use one of the specified group
ciphers.
```
```
tkip - Temporal Key Integrity Protocol - encryption protocol, compatible with legacy WEP equipment, but
enhanced to correct some of the WEP flaws.
aes-ccm - more secure WPA encryption protocol, based on the reliable AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
Networks free of WEP legacy should use only this cipher.
```
```
group-key-update (time:
30s..1d; Default: 5m)
```
```
Controls how often Access Point updates the group key. This key is used to encrypt all broadcast and multicast
frames. property only has effect for Access Points.
```
```
wpa-pre-shared-key (text;
Default: )
```
```
WPA pre-shared key mode requires all devices in a BSS to have common secret key. Value of this key can be an
arbitrary text. Commonly referred to as the network password for WPA mode. property only has effect when wpa-psk i
s added to authentication-types.
```
```
wpa2-pre-shared-key (text;
Default: )
```
```
WPA2 pre-shared key mode requires all devices in a BSS to have common secret key. Value of this key can be an
arbitrary text. Commonly referred to as the network password for WPA2 mode. property only has effect when wpa2-
psk is added to authentication-types.
```
Note: RouterOS also allows to override pre-shared key value for specific clients, using either the private-pre-shared-key property, or the Mikrotik-Wireless-
Psk attribute in the RADIUS MAC authentication response. This is an extension.
WPA EAP properties
These properties have effect only when authentication-types contains wpa-eap or wpa2-eap, and mode is set to dynamic-keys.
```
Property Description
```
```
eap-methods (eap-tls | eap-
ttls-mschapv2 | passthrough |
peap; Default: passthrough)
```
```
Allowed types of authentication methods, multiple values can be selected. This property only has effect on Access
Points.
```
```
eap-tls - Use built-in EAP TLS authentication. Both client and server certificates are supported. See description
of tls-mode and tls-certificate properties.
eap-ttls-mschapv2 - Use EAP-TTLS with MS-CHAPv2 authentication.
passthrough - Access Point will relay authentication process to the RADIUS server.
peap - Use Protected EAP authentication.
```
```
supplicant-identity (text;
Default: Identity)
```
```
EAP identity that is sent by client at the beginning of EAP authentication. This value is used as a value for User-
Name attribute in RADIUS messages sent by RADIUS EAP accounting and RADIUS EAP pass-through
authentication.
```
```
mschapv2-username (text;
Default: )
```
```
Username to use for authentication when eap-ttls-mschapv2 or peap authentication method is being used. This
property only has effect on Stations.
```
```
mschapv2-password (text;
Default: )
```
```
Password to use for authentication when eap-ttls-mschapv2 or peap authentication method is being used. This
property only has effect on Stations.
```
```
tls-mode (verify-certificate |
dont-verify-certificate | no-
certificates | verify-certificate-
with-crl; Default: no-
certificates)
```
```
This property has effect only when eap-methods contains eap-tls.
```
```
verify-certificate - Require remote device to have valid certificate. Check that it is signed by known certificate
authority. No additional identity verification is done. Certificate may include information about time period
during which it is valid. If router has incorrect time and date, it may reject valid certificate because router's clock
is outside that period. See also the Certificates configuration.
dont-verify-certificate - Do not check certificate of the remote device. Access Point will not require client to
provide certificate.
no-certificates - Do not use certificates. TLS session is established using 2048 bit anonymous Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.
verify-certificate-with-crl - Same as verify-certificate but also checks if the certificate is valid by checking the
Certificate Revocation List.
```
```
tls-certificate (none | name;
Default: none)
```
```
Access Point always needs a certificate when configured when tls-mode is set to verify-certificate, or is set to dont-
verify-certificate. Client needs a certificate only if Access Point is configured with tls-mode set to verify-certificate. In
this case client needs a valid certificate that is signed by a CA known to the Access Point. This property only has
effect when tls-mode is not set to no-certificates and eap-methods contains eap-tls.
```
Note: The order of allowed authentication methods in eap-methods is important, the same order is going to be used to send authentication method offers
to the Station. Example: Access Point uses security-profile where eap-methods is set to eap-tls,passthrough; 1) Access Point offers EAP-TLS method to
the client; 2) Client refuses; 3) Access Point starts relaying EAP communication to the radius server.
Note: When the AP is used for passthrough it is not required to add certificates on the AP itself, the AP device works as a transparent bridge and forwards
the EAP-TLS association data from RADIUS server to the end client.
Note: When tls-mode is using either verify-certificate or dont-verify-certificate, then the remote device has to support one of the RC4-
MD5, RC4-SHA or DES-CBC3-SHA TLS cipher suites. When using no-certificates mode, then the remote device must support "ADH-DES-CBC3-
SHA" cipher suite.
RADIUS properties
```
Property Description
```
```
radius-mac-authentication (yes | no; Default: no) This property affects the way how Access Point processes clients that are not
found in the Access List.
```
```
no - allow or reject client authentication based on the value of default-
authentication property of the Wireless interface.
yes - Query RADIUS server using MAC address of client as user name. With
this setting the value of default-authentication has no effect.
```
```
radius-mac-accounting (yes | no; Default: no)
```
```
radius-eap-accounting (yes | no; Default: no)
```
```
radius-called-format (mac | mac:ssid | ssid; Default: mac:ssid)
```
```
interim-update (time; Default:  0 ) When RADIUS accounting is used, Access Point periodically sends accounting
information updates to the RADIUS server. This property specifies default update
interval that can be overridden by the RADIUS server using Acct-Interim-Interval at
tribute.
```
```
radius-mac-format (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX | XXXX:XXXX:XXXX
| XXXXXX:XXXXXX | XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX | XXXXXX-
XXXXXX | XXXXXXXXXXXX | XX XX XX XX XX XX | lower
case; Default: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)
```
```
Controls how MAC address of the client is encoded by Access Point in the User-
Name attribute of the MAC authentication and MAC accounting RADIUS requests.
```
```
radius-mac-mode (as-username | as-username-and-password;
Default: as-username)
```
```
By default Access Point uses an empty password, when sending Access-Request
during MAC authentication. When this property is set to as-username-and-
password, Access Point will use the same value for User-Password attribute as for
the User-Name attribute.
```
```
radius-mac-caching (disabled | time; Default: disabled) If this value is set to time interval, the Access Point will cache RADIUS MAC
authentication responses for specified time, and will not contact RADIUS server if
matching cache entry already exists. Value disabled will disable cache, Access
Point will always contact RADIUS server.
```
WEP properties
These properties have effect only when mode is set to static-keys-required or static-keys-optional.
```
Property Description
```
```
static-key-0 | static-key-1 |
static-key-2 | static-key-3 (h
ex; Default: )
```
```
Hexadecimal representation of the key. Length of key must be appropriate for selected algorithm. See the Statically
configured WEP keys section.
```
```
static-algo-0 | static-algo-1
| static-algo-2 | static-algo-3
(none | 40bit-wep | 104bit-
wep | tkip | aes-ccm;
Default: none)
```
```
Encryption algorithm to use with the corresponding key.
```
```
static-transmit-key (key-0 |
key-1 | key-2 | key-3;
Default: key-0)
```
```
Access Point will use the specified key to encrypt frames for clients that do not use private key. Access Point will also
use this key to encrypt broadcast and multicast frames. Client will use the specified key to encrypt frames if static-sta-
private-algo is set to none. If corresponding static-algo-N property has value set to none, then frame will be sent
unencrypted (when mode is set to static-keys-optional) or will not be sent at all (when mode is set to static-keys-
required).
```
```
static-sta-private-key (hex;
Default: )
```
```
Length of key must be appropriate for selected algorithm, see the Statically configured WEP keys section. This
property is used only on Stations. Access Point uses corresponding key either from private-key property, or from Mikro
tik-Wireless-Enc-Key attribute.
```
```
static-sta-private-algo (none
| 40bit-wep | 104bit-wep |
tkip | aes-ccm; Default: none
)
```
```
Encryption algorithm to use with station private key. Value none disables use of the private key. This property is only
used on Stations. Access Point has to get corresponding value either from private-algo property, or from Mikrotik-
Wireless-Enc-Algo attribute. Station private key replaces key 0 for unicast frames. Station will not use private key to
decrypt broadcast frames.
```
Management frame protection
Used for: Deauthentication attack prevention, MAC address cloning issue.
RouterOS implements proprietary management frame protection algorithm based on shared secret. Management frame protection means that RouterOS
wireless device is able to verify source of management frame and confirm that particular frame is not malicious. This feature allows to withstand
deauthentication and disassociation attacks on RouterOS based wireless devices.
Management protection mode is configured in security-profile with management-protection setting. Possible values are: disabled - management protection
is disabled (default), allowed - use management protection if supported by remote party (for AP - allow both, non-management protection and
management protection clients, for client - connect both to APs with and without management protection), required - establish association only with remote
devices that support management protection (for AP - accept only clients that support management protection, for client - connect only to APs that support
management protection).
Management protection shared secret is configured with security-profile management-protection-key setting.
When interface is in AP mode, default management protection key (configured in security-profile) can be overridden by key specified in access-list or
RADIUS attribute.

Operation details
RADIUS MAC authentication
Note: RAIDUS MAC authentication is used by access point for clients that are not found in the access-list, similarly to the default-authentication property of
the wireless interface. It controls whether client is allowed to proceed with authentication, or is rejected immediately.
When radius-mac-authentication=yes, access point queries RADIUS server by sending Access-Request with the following attributes:
```
User-Name - Client MAC address. This is encoded as specified by the radius-mac-format setting. Default encoding is "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX".
Nas-Port-Id - name of wireless interface.
User-Password - When radius-mac-mode=as-username-and-password this is set to the same value as User-Name. Otherwise this attribute is
empty.
Calling-Station-Id - Client MAC address, encoded as "XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX".
Called-Station-Id - MAC address and SSID of the access point, encoded as "XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX:SSID" (minus separated pairs of MAC address
digits, followed by colon, followed by SSID value).
Acct-Session-Id - Added when radius-mac-accounting=yes.
```
When access point receives Access-Accept or Access-Reject response from the RADIUS server, it stores the response and either allows or rejects client.
Access point uses following RADIUS attributes from the Access-Accept response:
```
Ascend-Data-Rate
Ascend-Xmit-Rate
Mikrotik-Wireless-Forward - Same as access-list forwarding.
Mikrotik-Wireless-Enc-Algo - Same as access-list private-algo.
Mikrotik-Wireless-Enc-Key - Same as access-list private-key.
Mikrotik-Wireless-Psk - Same as access-list private-pre-shared-key.
Mikrotik-Wireless-Mpkey - Same as Management-protection-key in Access list
Session-Timeout - Time, after which client will be disconnected.
Acct-Interim-Interval - Overrides value of interim-update.
Class - If present, value of this attribute is saved and included in Accounting-Request messages.
```
Caching
Caching of RADIUS MAC authentication was added to support RADIUS authentication for clients that require from the access point very quick response to
the association request. Such clients time out before response from RADIUS server is received. Access point caches authentication response for some
time and can immediately reply to the repeated association request from the same client.
RADIUS EAP pass-through authentication
When using WPA EAP authentication type, clients that have passed MAC authentication are required to perform EAP authentication before being
authorized to pass data on wireless network. With pass-through EAP method the access point will relay authentication to RADIUS server, and use
following attributes in the Access-Request RADIUS message:
```
User-Name - EAP supplicant identity. This value is configured in the supplicant-identity property of the client security profile.
Nas-Port-Id - name of wireless interface.
Calling-Station-Id - Client MAC address, encoded as "XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX".
Called-Station-Id - MAC address and SSID of the access point, encoded as "XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX:SSID" (pairs of MAC address digits separated
by minus sign, followed by colon, followed by SSID value).
Acct-Session-Id - Added when radius-eap-accounting=yes.
Acct-Multi-Session-Id - MAC address of access point and client, and unique 8 byte value, that is shared for all accounting sessions that share
single EAP authentication. Encoded as AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX. Added when radius-eap-
accounting=yes.
```
Access point uses following RADIUS attributes from the Access-Accept server response:
```
Class - If present, value of this attribute is saved and included in Accounting-Request messages.
Session-Timeout - Time, after which client will be disconnected. Additionally, access point will remember authentication result, and if during this
time client reconnects, it will be authorized immediately, without repeating EAP authentication.
Acct-Interim-Interval - Overrides value of interim-update.
```
Statically configured WEP keys
Different algorithms require different length of keys:
```
40bit-wep - 10 hexadecimal digits (40 bits). If key is longer, only first 40 bits are used.
104bit-wep - 26 hexadecimal digits (104 bits). If key is longer, only first 104 bits are used.
tkip - At least 64 hexadecimal digits (256 bits).
aes-ccm - At least 32 hexadecimal digits (128 bits).
```
Key must contain even number of hexadecimal digits.
WDS security configuration
WDS links can use all available security features. However, they require careful configuration of security parameters.
It is possible to use one security profile for all clients, and different security profiles for WDS links. Security profile for WDS link is specified in connect-list.
Access point always checks connect list before establishing WDS link with another access point, and used security settings from matching connect list
entry. WDS link will work when each access point will have connect list entry that matches the other device, has connect=yes and specifies compatible sec
urity-profile.
WDS and WPA/WPA2
If access point uses security profile with mode=dynamic-keys, then encryption will be used for all WDS links. Since WPA authentication and key exchange
is not symmetrical, one of the access points will act as a client for the purpose of establishing secure connection. This is similar to how static-mesh and dyn
amic-mesh WDS modes work. Some problems, like single sided WDS link between two incorrectly configured access points that use non-mesh mode, is
not possible if WPA encryption is enabled. However, non-mesh modes with WPA still have other issues (like constant reconnection attempts in case of
configuration mismatch) that are solved by use of the -mesh WDS modes.
In general, WPA properties on both access points that establish WPA protected WDS link have to match. These properties are authentication-types, unicast
-ciphers, group-ciphers. For non-mesh WDS mode these properties need to have the same values on both devices. In mesh WDS mode each access point
has to support the other one as a client.
Theoretically it is possible to use RADIUS MAC authentication and other RADIUS services with WDS links. However, only one access point will interact
with the RADIUS server, the other access point will behave as a client.
Implementation of eap-tls EAP method in RouterOS is particularly well suited for WDS link encryption. tls-mode=no-certificates requires no additional
configuration, and provides very strong encryption.
WDS and WEP
mode, static-sta-private-key and static-sta-private-algo parameters in the security profile assigned to the WDS link need to have the same values on both
access points that establish WDS link with WPA encryption.
Security profile and access point matching in the connect list
Client uses value of connect-list security-profile property to match only those access points that support necessary security.
```
mode=static-keys-required and mode=static-keys-optional matches only access points with the same mode in interface security-profile.
If mode=dynamic-keys, then connect list entry matches if all of the authentication-types, unicast-ciphers and group-ciphers contain at least one
value that is advertised by access point.
```
Virtual interfaces
VirtualAP
It is possible to create virtual access points using the add command in the wireless menu. You must specify the master-interface which the virtual interface
will belong to. If "master-interface" mode is "station", Virtual AP will work only when "master-interface" will be active. The Virtual AP can have it's own SSID
and Security Profile.
Virtual AP interface will only work if master interface is in ap-bridge, bridge, station or wds-slave mode. It works only with 802.11 protocol, Nv2 is not
supported.
This feature is useful for separating access for different types of users. You can assign different bandwidth levels and passwords and instruct users to
connect to the specific virtual network, it will appear to wireless clients as a different SSID or a different device. For example, when using QuickSet to
configure a guest network, the VirtualAP feature is used in the background.
To create a new virtual-ap: /interface> wireless add mode=ap-bridge master-interface=wlan1 ssid=guests security-
profile=guests (such security profile first needs to be created)
Note: you can create up to 127 virtual interfaces per physical interface. It is not recommended to create more 30, since the performance will start to
degrade.
Virtual Clients
Note: Starting from 6.35 only in wireless-rep or wireless-cm2 package
It is also possible to create virtual clients and have both an AP and a Client on the same physical interface. This allows to make a repeater setup with only
using one hardware card. The process of configuration is exacly the same as above, but use mode station:
To create a new virtual-client: /interface> wireless add mode=station master-interface=wlan1 ssid=where-to-connect security-
profile=your-profile (such security profile first needs to be created)
Note: Virtual interfaces will always use the Master interface wireless frequency. If the Master interface has 'auto' frequency enabled it will use the wireless
frequency that the Master interface selected.
Sniffer
Sub-menu: /interface wireless sniffer
Wireless sniffer allows to capture frames including Radio header, 802.11 header and other wireless related information.
```
Property Description
```
```
channel-time (; Default: 200ms) How long to sniff each channel. Used only if multiple-channels=yes
```
```
file-limit (integer [10..4294967295]; Default:

taken from /interface wireless,
Yes means that all channel settings will be taken from scan-list under /interface wireless.
```
```
only-headers (yes | no; Default: no) If set to yes, then sniffer will capture only information stored in frame headers.
```
```
receive-errors (yes | no; Default: no) Whether to process packets which have been received with errors judging by their FCS.

```
Packets
Sub-menu: /interface wireless sniffer packet
Sub-menu shows captured packets.
Scan
Scan command allows to see available AP in the frequency range defined in the scan-list. Using scan command the interface operation is disabled
(wireless link is disconnected during the scan operation) Since RouterOS v6.35 (wireless-rep) background scan is supported which can be used during the
wireless interface operation without disconnecting the wireless link. Background scan is supported only using 802.11 wireless protocol.
Scan tool will continue scanning for AP until user stops the scan process. It is possible to use 'rounds' setting for the scan tool to do scan through the scan-
list entries specific times. It is useful when running scan tool using scripts. Example of scan command for one round:
```
/interface wireless scan wlan1 rounds=1
```
'save-file' option allows to do scripted/scheduled scans and save the results in file for future analysis. Also this feature together with rounds setting allows
to get scan results from the remote wireless clients - executing that command will start the scan tool which disconnect the wireless link, does the scan
through the scan-list frequencies and saves the results to file, exits the scan and connects the wireless link back. Example:
```
/interface wireless scan wlan1 rounds=1 save-file=scan1
```
To use background wireless scan the 'background=yes' setting should be provided. Example:
```
/interface wireless scan wlan1 background=yes
```
```
Use the command /interface wireless info scan-list to verify your scan-list defined under /interface wireless channels when using multiple-
channels=yes
```
Background scan feature is working in such conditions:
```
Wireless interface should be enabled
For wireless interface in AP mode - when it is operating in 802.11 protocol mode and is on fixed channel (that is - channel selection and initial
radar checking is over)
For wireless interface in Station mode - when it is connected to 802.11 protocol AP.
```
Scan command is supported also on the Virtual wireless interfaces with such limitations:
```
It is possible when virtual interface and its master is fixed on channel (master AP is running or master station is connected to AP).
Scan is only performed in channel master interface is on.
It does not matter if background=yes|no - on virtual interface scan does not disconnect clients/AP, so it is always "background".
```

WPS
Wireless interface supports WPS Server and also WPS Client (supported by wireless-rep package starting from RouterOS v6.35).
WPS Server
WPS Server allows to connect wireless clients that support WPS to AP protected with the Pre-Shared Key without specifying that key in the clients
configuration.
WPS Server can be enabled by changing the WPS Mode setting for the wireless interface. Example:
```
/interface wireless set wlan1 wps-mode=push-button
```
Wps-mode has 3 options
```
disabled
push-button - WPS is activated by pushing physical button on the board (few boards has such button marked on the board case/label)
push-button-virtual-only - WPS is activated by pushing "WPS Accept" button from the RouterOS wireless interface menu
```
By pushing the WPS physical/virtual button the AP enables the WPS functionality. If within 2 minutes the WPS process isn't initiated the WPS Accept
Function is stopped.
WPS Server is enabled by default on few boards that has physical WPS button marked. For example, hap lite, hap, hap ac lite, hap ac, map lite
WPS Server is active only when wireless AP interface has Pre-Shared Key Authentication (PSK) enabled. It is possible to configure this mode for the
Virtual AP interfaces as well.
WPS Client
WPS Client function allows the wireless client to get the Pre-Shared Key configuration of the AP that has WPS Server enabled. WPS Client can be
enabled by such command:
```
/interface wireless wps-client wlan1
```
WPS Client command outputs all the information of the WPS Enabled AP on the screen. Example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface wireless> wps-client wlan1
status: disconnected, success
ssid: MikroTik
mac-address: E4:8D:8C:D6:E0:AC
passphrase: presharedkey
authentication: wpa2-psk
encryption: aes-ccm
```
It is possible to specify additional settings for the WPS-Client command:
```
create-profile - creates wireless security profile with the specified name, configures it with security details received from the WPS AP, specifies
the wireless interface to use the new created security profile
ssid - get WPS information only from AP with specified SSID
mac-address - get WPS information only from AP with specified mac-address
```
Repeater
Wireless repeater will allow to receive the signal from the AP and repeat the signal using the same physical interface locally for connecting other clients.
This will allow to extend the wireless service for the wireless clients. Wireless repeater function will configure the wireless interface to connect to the AP
with station-bridge or station-pseudobridge option, create a virtual AP interface, create a bridge interface and add both (main and the virtual) interfaces to
the bridge ports.
If your AP supports button-enabled WPS mode, you can use the automatic setup command:
```
/interface wireless setup-repeater wlan1
```
The setup-repeater does the following steps:
```
searches for WPS AP with button pushed
acquires SSID, key, channel from AP
resets main master interface config (same as reset-configuration)
removes all bridge ports that were added for virtual interfaces added to this master (so there are no dangling invalid bridge ports later)
removes all virtual interfaces added to this master
creates security profile with name "<interfacename>-<ssid>-repeater", if such security profile already exists does not create new, just updates
settings
configures master interface, interface mode is selected like this: if AP supports bridge mode, use station-bridge, else if AP supports WDS, use
station-wds, else use station-pseudobridge
creates virtual AP interface with same SSID and security profile as master
if master interface is not in some bridge, creates new bridge interface and adds master interface to it
adds virtual AP interface to the same bridge master interface is in.
```
If your AP does not support WPS, it is possible to specify the settings manually, using these parameters:
```
address - MAC address of AP to setup repeater for (optional)
ssid - SSID of AP to setup repeater for (optional)
passphrase - key to use for AP - if this IS specified, command will just scan for AP and create security profile based on info in beacon and with
this passphrase. If this IS NOT specified, command will do WPS to find out passphrase.
```
Roaming
Station Roaming
Station Roaming feature is available only for 802.11 wireless protocol and only for station modes. When RouterOS wireless client is connected to the AP
using 802.11 wireless protocol it will periodically perform the background scan with specific time intervals. When the background scan will find an AP with
better signal it will try to roam to that AP. The time intervals between the background scans will become shorter when the wireless signal becomes worse
and the background scan interval will become longer when the wireless client signal will get better.
VLAN tagging
Sub-menu: /interface wireless
With VLAN tagging it is possible to separate Virtual AP traffic on Ethernet side of "locally forwarding" AP (the one on which wireless interfaces are bridged
with Ethernet). This is necessary to separate e.g. "management" and "guest" network traffic of Ethernet side of APs.
VLAN is assigned for wireless interface and as a result all data coming from wireless gets tagged with this tag and only data with this tag will send out over
wireless. This works for all wireless protocols except that on Nv2 there's no Virtual AP support.
You can configure your RADIUS authentication server to assign users or groups of users to a specific VLAN when they authenticate to the network. To use
this option you will need to use RADIUS attributes.
Note: In case to use this option you must enable wireless-fp or wireless-cm2 package for RouterOS version up to 6.37. Starting from RouterOS v6.37 you
can do that with regular wireless package.
```
Property Description
```
```
vlan-mode (no tag | user service tag | use tag; Default: no tag) Three VLAN modes are available:
```
```
no-tag - AP don't use VLAN tagging
use-service-tag - VLAN ID use 802.1ad tag type
use-tag - VLAN ID use 802.1q tag type
```
```
vlan-id (integer [1..4095]; Default:  1 ) VLAN identification number
```
Vlan tag override
Per-interface VLAN tag can be overridden on per-client basis by means of access-list and RADIUS attributes (for both - regular wireless and wireless
controller).
This way traffic can be separated between wireless clients even on the same interface, but must be used with care - only "interface VLAN" broadcast
/multicast traffic will be sent out. If working broadcast/multicast is necessary for other (overridden) VLANs as well, multicast-helper can be used for now
(this changes every multicast packet to unicast and then it is only sent to clients with matching VLAN ids).
Winbox
Winbox is a small utility that allows the administration of Mikrotik RouterOS using a fast and simple GUI.
Note: Current Tx Power gives you information about transmit power currently used at specific data rate. Currently not supported for Atheros 802.11ac
chips (e.g. QCA98xx).
Interworking Realms setting
For more information about interworking-profiles see the manual.
realms-raw - list of strings with hex values. Each string specifies contents of "NAI Realm Tuple", excluding "NAI Realm Data Field Length" field.
Each hex encoded string must consist of the following fields:
- NAI Realm Encoding (1 byte)
- NAI Realm Length (1 byte)
- NAI Realm (variable)
- EAP Method Count (1 byte)
- EAP Method Tuples (variable)
For example, value "00045465737401020d00" decodes as:
- NAI Realm Encoding: 0 (rfc4282)
- NAI Realm Length: 4
- NAI Realm: Test
- EAP Method Count: 1
- EAP Method Length: 2
- EAP Method Tuple: TLS, no EAP method parameters
Note, that setting "realms-raw=00045465737401020d00" produces the same advertisement contents as setting "realms=Test:eap-tls".
Refer to 802.11-2016, section 9.4.5.10 for full NAI Realm encoding.

Monitor shows current state of active connection. Distance measurement tool provides very precise distance measurements. "tx-sector-info" (feature in
testing stage) provides information from currently used beamforming pattern and shows direction to center - theoretical highest power output point.
Align
```
/interface w60g align wlan60-1
connected: yes
frequency: 58320
remote-address: 04:D6:AA:AA:AA:AB
tx-mcs: 6
tx-phy-rate: 1540.0Mbps
signal: 70
rssi: -62
10s-average-rssi: -63.1
tx-sector: 62
tx-sector-info: left 19 degrees, up 26.6 degrees
rx-sector: 96
distance: 220.88m
tx-packet-error-rate: 5%
```
In align mode frames between two devices are exchanged more rapidly and information about signal quality is displayed more often. Use "rssi", "10s-
average-rssi" and "tx-sector-info" (available from 6.44beta39) values for more precise link alignment. When devices enter align mode - link is lost for a few
seconds.
Sniff
Sniff mode allows to capture nearby 802.11ad frames. To use sniff mode same frequency needs to be used and interface operational mode needs to be
set to sniff:
```
/interface w60g set wlan60-1 mode=sniff
```
Now this interface can be used in Tools/Packet Sniffer for packet capture. Sniffer mode can't be used together with regular interface working modes.
Point to Multi Point setup example
All MikroTik devices can be interconnected. There are three different versions of wAP60G devices currently available:
```
Wireless Wire kit
wAP 60G
SXTsq60 Lite60
wAP 60G AP
```
And
```
Wireless Wire Dish
```
Hardware wise wAP devices are identical, but there are some software limitations -
wAP 60G AP is designed for Access Point usage in PtMP (Point to Multi Point) setups, but can be also used as PtP (Point to Point) or as Station device.
It's already equipped with level4 license for more than one connected client support More about Licenses
Wireless Wire kit, Wireless Wire Dish, SXTsq Lite60 and wAP60G devices comes with level3 license. Wireless wire dish should be only used as Client
device due to it's narrow radiation pattern.
License upgrade is needed to unlock more than one simultaneously connected client in Access Point mode, but devices can connect to Access Points as
regular Station devices.
Minimal configuration for transparent wireless link is matching SSID, correct mode (bridge || station-bridge) and Wireless and Ethernet interfaces put in
same bridge.
In current example we will look at usage case where wAP60G AP is used as Access Point, wAP60G and Wireless Wire kit devices are used as Station
devices, forming 4 unit network.
wAP60G AP units come pre-configured with WISP Bridge default configuration
SSID and bridge between Wireless and Ethernet interfaces is already configured. It's recommended to set up Wireless password and change SSID. If
device has been reset, you can also set correct mode and enable interface.
One liner that does all previously mentioned steps:
```
/interface w60g set wlan60-1 password="put_your_safe_password_here" ssid="put_your_new_ssid_here" disabled=no
mode=ap-bridge
```
Wireless Wire and wAP60G units come pre-configured with PTP Bridge default configuration.
Wireless Wire devices have already randomly generated matching SSID and Wireless password.
Bridge device (Bridge or Access point device with one connected client support) needs Wireless mode change to station-bridge.
One liner that can be used to set devices in client mode:
```
/interface w60g set wlan60-1 password="put_your_safe_password_here" ssid="put_your_new_ssid_here" disabled=no
mode=station-bridge
```
If configuration is done from empty configuration (reset without default configuration) -
new bridge needs to be created containing Wireless and Ethernet interfaces and IP address for easy access should be added.
```
Before configuration, make sure devices are running latest software versions: How to upgrade
```
```
It's recommended to change default IP addresses to avoid connection issues to the devices
```
```
{ /interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wlan60-1
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge1
}
```
For Access Point add this line to ensure all connected stations will be put in same bridge.
```
/interface w60g set wlan60-1 put-stations-in-bridge=bridge1
```
After successful connection for each Client device new entry will appear on Access Point device under:
```
/interface w60g station print
```
```
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
```
```
0 name="wlan60-station-1" parent=wlan60-1 remote-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA mtu=1500 mac-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:
AB arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto put-in-bridge=parent
```
```
0 name="wlan60-station-2" parent=wlan60-1 remote-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AB:AA mtu=1500 mac-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:
AC arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto put-in-bridge=parent
```
```
0 name="wlan60-station-3" parent=wlan60-1 remote-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AC:AA mtu=1500 mac-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:
AD arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto put-in-bridge=parent
```
```
0 name="wlan60-station-4" parent=wlan60-1 remote-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AD:AA mtu=1500 mac-address=AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:
AE arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto put-in-bridge=parent
```
For each client separate settings can be applied (queues, VLANS, Firewall rules, etc) providing more flexibility in configuration.
To limit client-client communication in same bridge isolate-stations option can be used on Access Point device:
```
/interface w60g set wlan60-1 isolate-stations=yes
```

Troubleshooting and Recommendations
MikroTik 60GHz solutions functionality includes support for for ATPC (Adaptive Transmit Power Control)
Physical Properties
Atmospheric attenuation for the wireless frequencies used in 802.11ad standard is very high, this should be taken in account before deploying links.
The Wireless Wire kit have been tested in distances up to 200 meters.
Wireless Wire dish kit is tested at distances up to 2500 meters For stability and full speed availability this kit is recommended for distances up to 1500
meters.
wAP60G devices are equipped with phase array 60° beamforming antennas, that can help signal find the way around objects in short distances but it's still
vital to keep the line of sight clear on higher distances.
LHG60G device single radiation pattern is less than 1 degree (both Horizontal and Vertical), All patterns combined provide close to 3 degree coverage in
both Horizontal and Vertical planes, best one for each situation is calculated by using beamforming algorithm. Beam width and direction depends on used
predefined calibrated sector.

Connection issues
In order to connect devices they need to be in direct visibility, "scan-list" on client device needs to include "frequency" used on AP device. LHG60 devices
require very precise alignment in order to get best performance in higher distances.
SNMP OIDs for monitoring
From RouterOS>=6.42rc6 SNMP support for W60G interface monitoring is added
For main interfaces:
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.1.8.1.2.1 integer Mode

# Fail-over PtMP CLI example

## Summary
This example shows how to configure automatic fail-over (bonding) 5Ghz link in combination with 60Ghz devices in CLI.
When a connection between 60Ghz wireless is lost, it will automatically use the bonded interface.
Example is done from empty configuration state with [WinBox] utility

## Connect to the device step by step
```
After configuration reset - only mac-telnet is possible.
Connect to device by connecting to it's MAC address or use WinBox New terminal to find device MAC address of the W60G device by issuing
command:
```
```
/ip neighbor print
```
```
To connect to the W60G device issue a command:
```
```
/tool mac-telnet mac-address
```
```
Enter username and password. By default username is admin and password is either blank or printed on the device sticker.
```
```
[admin@KD_GW] > /tool mac-telnet C4:AD:34:84:EE:5D
Login: admin
Password:
Trying C4:AD:34:84:EE:5D...
Connected to C4:AD:34:84:EE:5D
```

## Configure bridge
```
Add new bridge and assign bridge members to it by issuing the following command:
```
```
/interface bridge add name=bridge
```
```
To check if the bridge has been created issue a command:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge print
Flags: X - disabled, R - running
0 R name="bridge" mtu=auto actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=65535 arp=enabled arp-timeout=auto mac-address=1A:7F:

forward-delay=15s transmit-hold-count=6
vlan-filtering=no dhcp-snooping=no
```

## Set up 60Ghz wireless connection
All previously explained steps are identical to Bridge and Station devices. When configuring wireless interface different modes needs to be used.
For ap-bridge device -
```
Choose SSID, Password, frequency and choose bridge mode option that will act as ap-bridge for the setup, please see the example.
Enable W60G interface after required parameters have been set.
```

### 1.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g set wlan60-1 mode=ap-bridge frequency=auto ssid=MySSID

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g enable wlan60-1
```
For Station devices -
```
Choose the same SSID, Password, frequency as the bridge device and choose station-bridge mode option that will act as a station for the setup,
please see the example.
It is possible to connect up to 8 station devices to a single AP to act as a fail-over.
Enable W60G interface after required parameters have been set.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g set wlan60-1 mode=station-bridge frequency=auto ssid=MySSID
password=choosepassword isolate-stations=no
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g print

[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g enable wlan60-1
```
Set up 5Ghz wireless connection
For ap-bridge device -
```
Choose SSID, Password, frequency and choose bridge mode option that will act as a bridge for the setup, please see the example.
Enable 5Ghz interface after required parameters have been set.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface wireless security-profiles set [ find default=yes ] supplicant-

profile=default band=5ghz-a/n/ac
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface wireless enable wlan1
```
For Station devices -
```
Choose the same SSID, Password, frequency as the bridge device and choose station-bridge mode option that will act as a station for the setup,
please see the example.
It is possible to connect up to 8 station devices to a single AP to act as a fail-over.
Enable W60G interface after required parameters have been set.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface wireless security-profiles set [ find default=yes ] supplicant-
identity=MikroTik authentication-types=wpa2-psk mode=dynamic-keys wpa2-pre-shared-key=choosepassword
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface wireless set wlan1 frequency=auto scan-list=default installation=outdoor

profile=default band=5ghz-a/n/ac
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface wireless enable wlan1
```
Configure bridge for Access Point
```
Configure bridge for AP to ensure that 5ghz is working as fail-over. It is required to bridge wlan1, ether1, and all 60ghz station interfaces.
In the example it shows only 2 station devices but it is possible to add up to 8 devices.
```
```
For ap-bridge device please set configuration as follows:
```

3 wlan60-station-2 bridge 1 0x80 10 10 none
```
Configure bridge and bonding for station devices
```
Configure bonding and assign slave interfaces in this setup it is selected as built in wlan1 interface, but it can be also ether interface in other kind
of setups.
```
```
For station-bridge devices please set bonding as:
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bonding add mode=active-backup name=bond1 primary=wlan60-1 slaves=wlan60-
1,wlan1
```
```
Add interface members (ether1 and bond1) to newly created bridge.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add interface=bond1 bridge=bridge
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print

```
```
0 ether1 bridge yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
1 bond1
bridge yes 1 0x80 10 10 none
```
Additional configuration
Link should be established after all previously explained steps are done. It's recommended to set up administrator password on both devices.
Troubleshooting
Ensure connection is established to the correct device by checking the device settings like serial number and model name by issuing a command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system routerboard print
```
If bridge wlan60-1 interface in bridge settings is inactive and configuration is done properly  to enable the interface on a device - issue a command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface w60g enable wlan60-1
```

# CAPsMAN

## CAPsMAN AAA
Settings to configure CAPsMAN AAA functionality are found in the /caps-man aaa menu:
```
Property Description
```
```
mac-format (string; Default: X
X:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)
```
```
Controls how the MAC address of the client is encoded by Access Point in the User-Name attribute of the MAC
authentication and MAC accounting RADIUS requests.
```
```
mac-mode (as-username |
as-username-and-password;
Default: as username)
```
```
By default Access Point uses an empty password, when sending Access-Request during MAC authentication. When
this property is set to as-username-and-password, Access Point will use the same value for the User-Password
attribute as for the User-Name attribute.
```
```
mac-caching (disabled | time-
interval; Default: disabled)
```
```
If this value is set to a time interval, the Access Point will cache RADIUS MAC authentication responses for a
specified time, and will not contact the RADIUS server if matching cache entry already exists. The value disabled will
disable the cache, Access Point will always contact the RADIUS server.
```
```
interim-update (disabled |
time-interval; Default: disabled
)
```
```
When RADIUS accounting is used, Access Point periodically sends accounting information updates to the RADIUS
server. This property specifies the default update interval that can be overridden by the RADIUS server using the Acc
t-Interim-Interval attribute.
```
```
called-format (mac | mac:
ssid | ssid; Default: mac:ssid)
```
```
Format of how the "called-id" identifier will be passed to RADIUS. When configuring radius server clients, you can
specify "called-id" in order to separate multiple entires.
```

## Example
Assuming that rest of the settings are already configured and only the "Security" part has been left.

## Radius authentication with one server
1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration
2. Configure Radius server client
3. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself)
```
/caps-man security add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-
encryption=aes-ccm name=radius
/radius add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless
/caps-man configuration set security=radius
```

## Radius authentication with different radius servers for each SSID
1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration
2. Configure AAA settings
3. Configure Radius server clients
4. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself)
```
/caps-man security add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-
encryption=aes-ccm name=radius
/caps-man aaa set called-format=ssid
/radius add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID1
/radius add address=y.y.y.y secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID2
/caps-man configuration set security=radius
```
Now everyone connecting to CAP's with ssid=SSID1 will have their radius authentication requests sent to x.x.x.x and everyone connecting to CAP's with
ssid=SSID2 will have their radius authentication requests sent to y.y.y.y
CAPsMAN Access-list
Access list on CAPsMAN is an ordered list of rules that is used to allow/deny clients to connect to any CAP under CAPsMAN control. When a client
attempts to connect to a CAP that is controlled by CAPsMAN, CAP forwards that request to CAPsMAN. As a part of the registration process, CAPsMAN
consults an access list to determine if a client should be allowed to connect. The default behavior of the access list is to allow a connection.
Access list rules are processed one by one until a matching rule is found. Then the action in the matching rule is executed. If action specifies that the client
should be accepted, the client is accepted, potentially overriding its default connection parameters with ones specified in access-list rule.
An access list is configured in the /caps-man access-list menu. There are the following parameters for access-list rules:
```
client matching parameters:
address - MAC address of the client
mask - MAC address mask to apply when comparing client address
interface - optional interface to compare with an interface to which client actually connects to
time - a time of day and days when rule matches
signal-range - range in which client signal must fit for a rule to match
allow-signal-out-of-range - an option that permits the client's signal to be out of the range always or for some time interval
action parameter - specifies an action to take when client matches:
accept - accept client
reject - reject client
query-radius - query RADIUS server if a particular client is allowed to connect
connection parameters:
ap-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to client
client-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to AP (applies to RouterOS clients only)
client-to-client-forwarding - specifies whether to allow forwarding data received from this client to other clients connected to the same
interface
private-passphrase - PSK passphrase to use for this client if some PSK authentication algorithm is used
radius-accounting - specifies if RADIUS traffic accounting should be used if RADIUS authentication gets done for this client
vlan-mode - VLAN tagging mode specifies if traffic coming from a client should get tagged (and untagged when going to a client).
vlan-id - VLAN ID to use if doing VLAN tagging.
```

CAPsMAN datapath
Datapath settings control data forwarding related aspects. On CAPsMAN datapath settings are configured in the datapath profile menu /caps-man datapath
or directly in a configuration profile or interface menu as settings with datapath. prefix.
There are 2 major forwarding modes:
```
local forwarding mode, where CAP is locally forwarding data to and from wireless interface
```
```
manager forwarding mode, where CAP sends to CAPsMAN all data received over wireless and only sends out the wireless data received from
CAPsMAN. In this mode, even client-to-client forwarding is controlled and performed by CAPsMAN.
```
Forwarding mode is configured on a per-interface basis - so if one CAP provides 2 radio interfaces, one can be configured to operate in local forwarding
mode and the other in manager forwarding mode. The same applies to Virtual-AP interfaces - each can have different forwarding mode from master
interface or other Virtual-AP interfaces.
Most of the datapath settings are used only when in manager forwarding mode, because in local forwarding mode CAPsMAN does not have control over
data forwarding.
There are the following datapath settings:
```
bridge -- bridge interface to add interface to, as a bridge port, when enabled
bridge-cost -- bridge port cost to use when adding as bridge port
bridge-horizon -- bridge horizon to use when adding as bridge port
client-to-client-forwarding -- controls if client-to-client forwarding between wireless clients connected to interface should be allowed, in local
forwarding mode this function is performed by CAP, otherwise it is performed by CAPsMAN.
local-forwarding -- controls forwarding mode
openflow-switch -- OpenFlow switch to add interface to, as port when enabled
vlan-id -- VLAN ID to assign to interface if vlan-mode enables use of VLAN tagging
vlan-mode -- VLAN tagging mode specifies if VLAN tag should be assigned to interface (causes all received data to get tagged with VLAN tag and
allows interface to only send out data tagged with given tag)
```
CAPsMAN interface
CAPsMAN interfaces are managed in /caps-man interface menu:
```

section. If empty string is set, CAPsMAN can use built-in RouterOS packages, note that in this case only CAPs with
the same architecture as CAPsMAN will be upgraded.
```
```

```
Upgrade policy options
```
```
none - do not perform upgrade
require-same-version - CAPsMAN suggest to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will not
provision the CAP. (Manual provision is still possible)
suggest-same-version - CAPsMAN suggests to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will still be
provisioned
```
CAPsMAN provisioning
CAPsMAN distinguishes between CAPs based on a common-name identifier. The identifier is generated based on the following rules:
```
if CAP provided a certificate, the identifier is set to the Common Name field in the certificate
otherwise, an identifier is based on Base-MAC provided by CAP in the form: '[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX]'.
```
When the DTLS connection with CAP is successfully established (which means that CAP identifier is known and valid), CAPsMAN makes sure there is no
stale connection with CAP using the same identifier. Currently connected CAPs are listed in /caps-man remote-cap menu:
```
[admin@CM] /caps-man> remote-cap print
# ADDRESS IDENT STATE RADIOS 0 00:0C:42:00:C0:32/27044 MT-000C4200C032 Run 1
```
CAPsMAN distinguishes between actual wireless interfaces (radios) based on their built-in MAC address (radio-mac). This implies that it is impossible to
manage two radios with the same MAC address on one CAPsMAN. Radios currently managed by CAPsMAN (provided by connected CAPs) are listed in /c
aps-man radio menu:
```
[admin@CM] /caps-man> radio print
Flags: L - local, P - provisioned
# RADIO-MAC INTERFACE REMOTE-AP-IDENT
0 P 00:03:7F:48:CC:07 cap1 MT-000C4200C032
```
When CAP connects, CAPsMAN at first tries to bind each CAP radio to CAPsMAN master interface based on radio-mac. If an appropriate interface is
found, radio gets set up using master interface configuration and configuration of slave interfaces that refer to a particular master interface. At this moment
interfaces (both master and slaves) are considered bound to radio and radio is considered provisioned.
If no matching master interface for radio is found, CAPsMAN executes 'provisioning rules'. Provisioning rules is an ordered list of rules that contain settings
that specify which radio to match and settings that specify what action to take if a radio matches.
Provisioning rules for matching radios are configured in /caps-man provisioning menu:
```
Property Description
```
```
action (create-disabled | create-enabled |
create-dynamic-enabled | none; Default: none)
```
```
Action to take if rule matches are specified by the following settings:
```
```
create-disabled - create disabled static interfaces for radio. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to
the radio, but the radio will not be operational until the interface is manually enabled;
create-enabled - create enabled static interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to the radio
and the radio will be operational;
create-dynamic-enabled - create enabled dynamic interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound
to the radio, and the radio will be operational;
none - do nothing, leaves radio in the non-provisioned state;
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the Provisioning rule
```
```
common-name-regexp (string; Default: ) Regular expression to match radios by common name. Each CAP's common name identifier can
be found under "/caps-man radio" as value "REMOTE-CAP-NAME"
```
```
hw-supported-modes (a|a-turbo|ac|an|b|g|g-
turbo|gn; Default: )
```
```

```
```
identity-regexp (string; Default: ) Regular expression to match radios by router identity
```
```
ip-address-ranges (IpAddressRange[,
IpAddressRanges] max 100x; Default: "")
```
```

```
```
master-configuration (string; Default: ) If action specifies to create interfaces, then a new master interface with its configuration set to this
configuration profile will be created
```
```
name-format (cap | identity | prefix | prefix-
identity; Default: cap)
```
```
specify the syntax of the CAP interface name creation
```
```
cap - default name
identity - CAP boards system identity name
prefix - name from the name-prefix value
prefix-identity - name from the name-prefix value and the CAP boards system identity name
```
```
name-prefix (string; Default: ) name prefix which can be used in the name-format for creating the CAP interface names
```
```
radio-mac (MAC address; Default: 00:00:00:00:
00:00)
```
```
MAC address of radio to be matched, empty MAC (00:00:00:00:00:00) means match all MAC
addresses
```
```
slave-configurations (string; Default: ) If action specifies to create interfaces, then a new slave interface for each configuration profile in
this list is created.
```
To get the active provisioning matchers:
```
[admin@CM] /caps-man provisioning> print
Flags: X - disabled
0 radio-mac=00:00:00:00:00:00 action=create-enabled master-configuration=main-cfg
slave-configurations=virtual-ap-cfg name-prefix=""
```
For the user's convenience there are commands that allow the re-execution of the provisioning process for some radio or all radios provided by some AP:
```
[admin@CM] > caps-man radio provision 0
```
and
```
[admin@CM] > caps-man remote-cap provision 0
```

Assuming that rest of the settings are already configured and only the "Security" part has been left.
Radius authentication with one server
1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration
2. Configure Radius server client
3. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself)
```
/caps-man security add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-
encryption=aes-ccm name=radius
/radius add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless
/caps-man configuration set security=radius
```
Radius authentication with different radius servers for each SSID
1. Create CAPsMAN security configuration
2. Configure AAA settings
3. Configure Radius server clients
4. Assign the configuration to your master profile (or directly to CAP itself)
```
/caps-man security add authentication-types=wpa2-eap eap-methods=passthrough encryption=aes-ccm group-
encryption=aes-ccm name=radius
/caps-man aaa set called-format=ssid
/radius add address=x.x.x.x secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID1
/radius add address=y.y.y.y secret=SecretUserPass service=wireless called-id=SSID2
/caps-man configuration set security=radius
```
Now everyone connecting to CAP's with ssid=SSID1 will have their radius authentication requests sent to x.x.x.x and everyone connecting to CAP's with
ssid=SSID2 will have their radius authentication requests sent to y.y.y.y

## Overview 
CAPsMAN allows applying wireless settings to multiple MikroTik AP devices from a central configuration interface.
More specifically, the Controlled Access Point system Manager (CAPsMAN) allows centralization of wireless network management and if necessary, data
processing. When using the CAPsMAN feature, the network will consist of a number of 'Controlled Access Points' (CAP) that provide wireless connectivity
and a 'system Manager' (CAPsMAN) that manages the configuration of the APs, it also takes care of client authentication and optionally, data forwarding.
When a CAP is controlled by CAPsMAN it only requires the minimum configuration required to allow it to establish a connection with CAPsMAN. Functions
that were conventionally executed by an AP (like access control, client authentication) are now executed by CAPsMAN. The CAP device now only has to
provide the wireless link layer encryption/decryption.
Depending on the configuration, data is either forwarded to CAPsMAN for centralized processing (default) or forwarded locally at the CAP itself (local
forwarding mode).
Requirements
```
Any RouterOS device can be a controlled wireless access point (CAP) as long as it has at least a Level 4 RouterOS license
CAPsMAN server can be installed on any RouterOS device, even if the device itself does not have a wireless interface
Unlimited CAPs (access points) supported by CAPsMAN
32 Radios per CAP maximum
32 Virtual interfaces per master radio interface maximum
Not possible to use Nv2 and NStreme proprietary protocols
```

## Simple setup of a CAPsMAN system
Before deep-diving into the details of CAPsMAN operation, let us quickly illustrate how to set up the most basic system where you have a MikroTik router
that manages two MikroTik AP devices. The benefit of CAPsMAN is that the CAP units don't need to be configured, all settings are done in the CAPsMAN
server.
The CAPsMAN setup consists of defining configuration templates, which will then be pushed to the controllable AP devices (CAPs). Assuming your main
router is already connected to the internet and works fine, you can proceed as follows.
In the central device, which will be your CAPsMAN server, create a new "Configuration" template with only the basic settings (network name, country, the
local LAN bridge interface, the wireless password):
1. add new configuration profile

### 2.

### 3.
Then create a new "Provisioning" rule, which will assign the created configuration template to the CAP devices:

### 4. 
All that remains to do on the CAPsMAN, is to enable it:

### 5. 
Most MikroTik AP devices already support CAP mode out of the box, all you need to do, is make sure they are on the same network as your CAPsMAN,
and then boot them up, while holding the reset button.
So, for example, connect the CAP device to one of the CAPsMAN device LAN ports while it is turned off, then hold the reset button, and power on the CAP
device. Keep holding the button until the User LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total
time to hold the button, around 10 seconds).
The device will now show up in the CAPsMAN "Remote CAP" menu and will be "provisioned" with the configuration template, as per the provisioning
settings. For more details on how to manually adjust all settings, keep reading this document.
CAP to CAPsMAN Connection
For the CAPsMAN system to function and provide wireless connectivity, a CAP must establish management connection with CAPsMAN. A management
connection can be established using MAC or IP layer protocols and is secured using 'DTLS'.
A CAP can also pass the client data connection to the Manager, but the data connection is not secured. If this is deemed necessary, then other means of
data security needs to be used, e.g. IPSec or encrypted tunnels.
CAP to CAPsMAN connection can be established using 2 transport protocols (via Layer 2 and Layer3).
```
MAC layer connection features:
no IP configuration necessary on CAP
CAP and CAPsMAN must be on the same Layer 2 segment - either physical or virtual (by means of L2 tunnels)
IP layer (UDP) connection features:
can traverse NAT if necessary
CAP must be able to reach CAPsMAN using IP protocol
if the CAP is not on the same L2 segment as CAPsMAN, it must be provisioned with the CAPsMAN IP address, because IP multicast
based discovery does not work over Layer3
```
In order to establish connection with CAPsMAN, CAP executes a discovery process. During discovery, CAP attempts to contact CAPsMAN and builds an
available CAPsMANs list. CAP attempts to contact to an available CAPsMAN using:
```
configured list of Manager IP addresses
list of CAPsMAN IP addresses obtained from DHCP server
broadcasting on configured interfaces using both - IP and MAC layer protocols.
```
When the list of available CAPsMANs is built, CAP selects a CAPsMAN based on the following rules:
```
if caps-man-names parameter specifies allowed manager names (/system identity of CAPsMAN), CAP will prefer the CAPsMAN that is earlier in
the list, if list is empty it will connect to any available Manager
suitable Manager with MAC layer connectivity is preferred to Manager with IP connectivity
```
After Manager is selected, CAP attempts to establish DTLS connection. There are the following authentication modes possible:
```
no certificates on CAP and CAPsMAN - no authentication
```
```
only Manager is configured with certificate - CAP checks CAPsMAN certificate, but does not fail if it does not have appropriate trusted CA
certificate, CAPsMAN must be configured with require-peer-certificate=no in order to establish connection with CAP that does not possess
certificate
CAP and CAPsMAN are configured with certificates - mutual authentication
```
After DTLS connection is established, CAP can optionally check CommonName field of certificate provided by CAPsMAN. caps-man-certificate-common-
names parameter contains list of allowed CommonName values. If this list is not empty, CAPsMAN must be configured with certificate. If this list is empty,
CAP does not check CommonName field.
If the CAPsMAN or CAP gets disconnected from the network, the loss of connection between CAP and CAPsMAN will be detected in approximately 10-20
seconds.
CAP Auto Locking to CAPsMAN
CAP can be configured to automatically lock to a particular CAPsMAN server. Locking is implemented by recording certificate CommonName of CAPsMAN
that CAP is locked to and checking this CommonName for all subsequent connections. As this feature is implemented using certificate CommonName, use
of certificates is mandatory for locking to work.
Locking is enabled by the following command:
[admin@CAP] > /interface wireless cap set lock-to-caps-man=yes
Once CAP connects to suitable CAPsMAN and locks to it, it is reflected like this:
[admin@wtp] > /interface wireless cap print
...
locked-caps-man-common-name: CAPsMAN-000C424C30F3
From now on CAP will only connect to CAPsMAN with this CommonName, until locking requirement is cleared, by setting lock-to-caps-man=no. This
approach needs to be used if it is necessary to force CAP to lock to another CAPsMAN - by at first setting lock-to-caps-man=no followed by lock-to-caps-
man=yes.
Note that CAP can be manually "locked" to CAPsMAN by setting caps-man-certificate-common-names.
Auto Certificates
To simplify CAPsMAN and CAP configuration when certificates are required (e.g. for automatic locking feature), CAPsMAN can be configured to generate
necessary certificates automatically and CAP can be configured to request certificate from CAPsMAN.
Automatic certificates do not provide full public key infrastructure and are provided for simple setups. If more complicated PKI is necessary - supporting
proper certificate validity periods, multiple-level CA certificates, certificate renewal - other means must be used, such as manual certificate distribution or
SCEP.
CAPsMAN has the following certificate settings:
```
certificate - this is CAPsMAN certificate, private key must be available for this certificate. If set to none, CAPsMAN will operate in no-certificate
mode and none of certificate requiring features will work. If set to auto, CAPsMAN will attempt to issue certificate to itself using CA certificate (see
ca-certificate description). Note that CommonName automatically issued certificate will be "CAPsMAN-<mac address>" and validity period for will
be the same as for CA certificate.
ca-certificate - this is CA certificate that CAPsMAN will use when issuing certificate for itself if necessary (see certificate description) and when
signing certificate requests from CAPs. If set to none, CAPsMAN will not be able to issue certificate to itself or sign certificate requests from
CAPs. If set to auto, CAPsMAN will generate self-signed CA certificate to use as CA certificate. CommonName for this certificate will take form
"CAPsMAN-CA-<mac address>" and validity period will be from jan/01/1970 until jan/18/2038.
```
When CAPsMAN will auto-generate certificates, this will be reflected like this:
[admin@CM] /caps-man manager> pr
enabled: yes
certificate: auto
ca-certificate: auto
require-peer-certificate: no
generated-certificate: CAPsMAN-000C424C30F3

And certificates:

CAP can be configured to request certificate from CAPsMAN. In order for this to work, CAP must be configured with setting certificate=request and
CAPsMAN must have CA certificate available (either specified in ca-certificate setting or auto-generated).
CAP will initially generate private key and certificate request with CommonName of form "CAP-<mac address>". When CAP will establish connection with
CAPsMAN, CAP will request CAPsMAN to sign its certificate request. If this will succeed, CAPsMAN will send CA certificate and newly issued certificate to
CAP. CAP will import these certificates in its certificate store:

On subsequent connections to CAPsMAN, CAP will use generated certificate.
CAP Configuration
When an AP is configured to be controlled by CAPsMAN, configuration of the managed wireless interfaces on the AP is ignored (exceptions: antenna-gain,
antenna-mode). Instead, AP accepts configuration for the managed interfaces from CAPsMAN.
CAP behavior of AP is configured in /interface wireless cap menu. From there you can:
```
Disable or enable CAP feature on the device
Set list of wireless interfaces to be controlled by Manager
Set list of interfaces over which CAP should attempt to discover Manager
Set list of Manager IP addresses that CAP will attempt to contact during discovery
Set list of Manager names that CAP will attempt to connect
Set list of Manager certificate CommonNames that CAP will connect to
Set bridge to which interfaces should be added when local forwarding mode is used
```
Each wireless interface on a CAP that is under CAPsMAN control appears as a virtual interface on the CAPsMAN. This provides maximum flexibility in
data forwarding control using regular RouterOS features, such as routing, bridging, firewall, etc.CAPsMAN Configuration Concepts
```
The CAP wireless interfaces that are managed by CAPsMAN and whose traffic is being forwarded to CAPsMAN (ie. they are not in local
forwarding mode), are shown as disabled, with the note Managed by CAPsMAN. Those interfaces that are in local forwarding mode (traffic is
locally managed by CAP, and only management is done by CAPsMAN) are not shown disabled, but the note Managed by CAPsMAN is shown
```
Many wireless interface settings are able to be grouped together into named groups ('profiles') that simplifies the reuse of configuration - for example,
common configuration settings can be configured in a 'configuration profile' and multiple interfaces can then refer to that profile. At the same time any
profile setting can be overridden directly in an interface configuration for maximum flexibility.
Currently there are the following setting groups:
```
channel - channel related settings, such as frequency and width
datapath - data forwarding related settings, such as bridge to which particular interface should be automatically added as port
security - security related settings, such as allowed authentication types or passphrase
configuration - main wireless settings group, includes settings such as SSID, and additionally binds together other setting groups - that is,
configuration profile can refer to channel, security, etc. named setting groups. Additionally any setting can be overridden directly in configuration
profile.
```
Interface settings bind together all setting groups, but additionally any setting can be overridden directly in interface settings.
By means of setting groups, configuration is organized in hierarchical structure with interface (actual user of configuration) as the root. In order to figure out
the effective value of some setting this structure is consulted in a fashion where a higher level setting value overrides a lower level value.
For example, when WPA2 passphrase to be used by a particular interface needs to be found, the following places are consulted and the first place with
WPA2 passphrase configured specifies effective passphrase. "->" denotes referring to setting profile (if configured):
```
interface passphrase
interface->security passphrase
interface->configuration passphrase
interface->configuration->security passphrase
```
There are 2 types of interfaces on CAPsMAN - "master" and "slave". The master interface holds the configuration for an actual wireless interface (radio),
while a slave interface links to the master interface and is intended to hold the configuration for a Virtual-AP (multiple SSID support). There are settings
that are meaningful only for master interface, i.e. mainly hardware setup related settings such as radio channel settings. Note that in order for a radio to
accept clients, it's master interface needs to be enabled. Slave interfaces will become operational only if enabled and the master interface is enabled.
Interfaces on CAPsMAN can be static or dynamic. Static interfaces are stored in RouterOS configuration and will persist across reboots. Dynamic
interfaces exist only while a particular CAP is connected to CAPsMAN.
CAPsMAN Global Configuration
Settings to enable CAPsMAN functionality are found in /caps-man manager menu:
```
Property Description
```
```
enabled (yes | no; Default: no) Disable or enable CAPsMAN functionality
```
```
certificate (auto | certificate
name | none; Default: none)
```
```
Device certificate
```
```
ca-certificate (auto | certificate
name | none; Default: none)
```
```
Device CA certificate
```
```
require-peer-certificate (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Require all connecting CAPs to have a valid certificate
```
```
package-path (string |; Default: ) Folder location for the RouterOS packages. For example, use "/upgrade" to specify the upgrade folder from the files
section. If empty string is set, CAPsMAN can use built-in RouterOS packages, note that in this case only CAPs with
the same architecture as CAPsMAN will be upgraded.
```
```
upgrade-policy (none | require-
same-version | suggest-same-
upgrade; Default: none)
```
```
Upgrade policy options
```
```
none - do not perform upgrade
require-same-version - CAPsMAN suggest to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will not
provision the CAP. (Manual provision is still possible)
suggest-same-version - CAPsMAN suggests to upgrade the CAP RouterOS version and if it fails it will still be
provisioned
```
Radio Provisioning
CAPsMAN distinguishes between CAPs based on an identifier. The identifier is generated based on the following rules:
```
if CAP provided a certificate, identifier is set to the Common Name field in the certificate
otherwise identifier is based on Base-MAC provided by CAP in the form: '[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX]'.
```
When the DTLS connection with CAP is successfully established (which means that CAP identifier is known and valid), CAPsMAN makes sure there is no
stale connection with CAP using the same identifier. Currently connected CAPs are listed in /caps-man remote-cap menu:
[admin@CM] /caps-man> remote-cap print


# ADDRESS IDENT STATE RADIOS
0 00:0C:42:00:C0:32/27044 MT-000C4200C032 Run 1
CAPsMAN distinguishes between actual wireless interfaces (radios) based on their builtin MAC address (radio-mac). This implies that it is impossible to
manage two radios with the same MAC address on one CAPsMAN. Radios currently managed by CAPsMAN (provided by connected CAPs) are listed in /c
aps-man radio menu:
[admin@CM] /caps-man> radio print
Flags: L - local, P - provisioned


# RADIO-MAC INTERFACE REMOTE-AP-IDENT
0 P 00:03:7F:48:CC:07 cap1 MT-000C4200C032
When CAP connects, CAPsMAN at first tries to bind each CAP radio to CAPsMAN master interface based on radio-mac. If an appropriate interface is
found, radio gets set up using master interface configuration and configuration of slave interfaces that refer to particular master interface. At this moment
interfaces (both master and slaves) are considered bound to radio and radio is considered provisioned.
If no matching master interface for radio is found, CAPsMAN executes 'provisioning rules'. Provisioning rules is an ordered list of rules that contain settings
that specify which radio to match and settings that specify what action to take if a radio matches.
Provisioning rules for matching radios are configured in /caps-man provisioning menu:
```
Property Description
```
```
action (create-disabled | create-enabled |
create-dynamic-enabled | none; Default: none)
```
```
Action to take if rule matches are specified by the following settings:
```
```
create-disabled - create disabled static interfaces for radio. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to
the radio, but the radio will not be operational until the interface is manually enabled;
create-enabled - create enabled static interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to the radio
and the radio will be operational;
create-dynamic-enabled - create enabled dynamic interfaces. I.e., the interfaces will be bound to
the radio, and the radio will be operational;
none - do nothing, leaves radio in non-provisioned state;

Datapath Configuration
Datapath settings control data forwarding related aspects. On CAPsMAN datapath settings are configured in datapath profile menu /caps-man datapath or
directly in a configuration profile or interface menu as settings with datapath. prefix.
There are 2 major forwarding modes:
```
local forwarding mode, where CAP is locally forwarding data to and from wireless interface
manager forwarding mode, where CAP sends to CAPsMAN all data received over wireless and only sends out the wireless data received from
CAPsMAN. In this mode even client-to-client forwarding is controlled and performed by CAPsMAN.
```
Forwarding mode is configured on a per-interface basis - so if one CAP provides 2 radio interfaces, one can be configured to operate in local forwarding
mode and the other in manager forwarding mode. The same applies to Virtual-AP interfaces - each can have different forwarding mode from master
interface or other Virtual-AP interfaces.
Most of the datapath settings are used only when in manager forwarding mode, because in local forwarding mode CAPsMAN does not have control over
data forwarding.
There are the following datapath settings:
```
bridge -- bridge interface to add interface to, as a bridge port, when enabled
bridge-cost -- bridge port cost to use when adding as bridge port
bridge-horizon -- bridge horizon to use when adding as bridge port
client-to-client-forwarding -- controls if client-to-client forwarding between wireless clients connected to interface should be allowed, in local
forwarding mode this function is performed by CAP, otherwise it is performed by CAPsMAN.
local-forwarding -- controls forwarding mode
openflow-switch -- OpenFlow switch to add interface to, as port when enabled
vlan-id -- VLAN ID to assign to interface if vlan-mode enables use of VLAN tagging
vlan-mode -- VLAN tagging mode specifies if VLAN tag should be assigned to interface (causes all received data to get tagged with VLAN tag and
allows interface to only send out data tagged with given tag)
```
Local Forwarding Mode
In this mode wireless interface on CAP behaves as a normal interface and takes part in normal data forwarding. Wireless interface will accept/pass data to
networking stack on CAP. CAPsMAN will not participate in data forwarding and will not process any of data frames, it will only control interface
configuration and client association process.
Wireless interface on CAP will change its configuration to 'enabled' and its state and some relevant parameters (e.g. mac-address, arp, mtu) will reflect that
of the interface on CAPsMAN. Note that wireless related configuration will not reflect actual interface configuration as applied by CAPsMAN:

name="wlan6" mtu=1500 mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:00 arp=enabled
interface-type=virtual-AP master-interface=wlan2
The fact that Virtual-AP interfaces are added as dynamic, somewhat limits static configuration possibilities on CAP for data forwarding, such as assigning
addresses to Virtual-AP interface. This does not apply to master wireless interface.
To overcome this it is possible to use the static-virtual setting on the CAP which will create Static Virtual Interfaces instead of Dynamic and allows the
possibility to assign IP configuration to those interfaces. MAC address is used to remember each static-interface when applying the configuration from the
CAPsMAN. If two or more static interfaces will have the same MAC address the configuration could be applied in random order.
To facilitate data forwarding configuration, CAP can be configured with bridge to which interfaces are automatically added as ports when interfaces are
enabled by CAPsMAN. This can be done in /interface wireless cap menu.
Manager Forwarding Mode
In this mode CAP sends all data received over wireless to CAPsMAN and only sends out over wireless, data received from CAPsMAN. CAPsMAN has full
control over data forwarding including client-to-client forwarding. Wireless interface on CAP is disabled and does not participate in networking:
...
1 X ;;; managed by CAPsMAN
;;; channel: 5180/20-Ceee/ac, SSID: master, manager forwarding
name="wlan2" mtu=1500 mac-address=00:03:7F:48:CC:07 arp=enabled
interface-type=Atheros AR9888 mode=ap-bridge ssid="merlin"
...
Virtual-AP interfaces are also created as 'disabled' and do not take part in data forwarding on CAP.
Access List
Access list on CAPsMAN is an ordered list of rules that is used to allow/deny clients to connect to any CAP under CAPsMAN control. When client attempts
to connect to a CAP that is controlled by CAPsMAN, CAP forwards that request to CAPsMAN. As a part of registration process, CAPsMAN consults
access list to determine if client should be allowed to connect. The default behaviour of the access list is to allow connection.
Access list rules are processed one by one until matching rule is found. Then the action in the matching rule is executed. If action specifies that client
should be accepted, client is accepted, potentially overriding it's default connection parameters with ones specified in access list rule.
Access list is configured in /caps-man access-list menu. There are the following parameters for access list rules:
```
client matching parameters:
address - MAC address of client (or, if mask is specified, only those parts will be checked as per the mask, so to match vendor D8 from
"D8:1C:79:6E:1E:FE", simply enter a bogus entry, such as "D8:00:00:00:00" and then use the mask as per next line)
mask - MAC address mask to apply when comparing client address. For example, use FF:00:00:00:00:00 to match only the first octet of
the specified MAC address. In above example, regardless of entered MAC, it will match only first octet. Similarly, entering 00:00:00:00:
FF will only match the last octet (FE) of a hypotetical MAC "D8:1C:79:6E:1E:FE"). So in the mac line, you could just enter 00:00:00:00:00:
FE, if you would use such a mask.
interface - optional interface to compare with interface to which client actually connects to
time - time of day and days when rule matches
signal-range - range in which client signal must fit for rule to match
action parameter - specifies action to take when client matches:
accept - accept client
reject - reject client
query-radius - query RADIUS server if particular client is allowed to connect
connection parameters:
ap-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to client
client-tx-limit - tx speed limit in direction to AP (applies to RouterOS clients only)
client-to-client-forwarding - specifies whether to allow forwarding data received from this client to other clients connected to the same
interface
private-passphrase - PSK passphrase to use for this client if some PSK authentication algorithm is used
radius-accounting - specifies if RADIUS traffic accounting should be used if RADIUS authentication gets done for this client
vlan-mode - VLAN tagging mode specifies if traffic coming from client should get tagged (and untagged when going to client).
vlan-id - VLAN ID to use if doing VLAN tagging.
```
Registration Table
Registration table contains a list of clients that are connected to radios controlled by CAPsMAN and is available in /caps-man registration-table menu:
[admin@CM] /caps-man> registration-table print


# INTERFACE MAC-ADDRESS UPTIME RX-SIGNAL
0 cap1 00:03:7F:48:CC:0B 1h38m9s210ms -36
Examples
Basic configuration with master and slave interface
Create security profile for WPA2 PSK, without specifying passphrase:
[admin@CM] /caps-man security>add name="wpa2psk" authentication-types=wpa2-psk encryption=aes-ccm
Create configuration profile to be used by master interface
```
specify WPA2 passphrase in configuration
specify channel settings in configuration:
```
[admin@CM] /caps-man configuration> add name=master-cfg ssid=master security=wpa2psk
security.passphrase=12345678 channel.frequency=5180 channel.width=20 channel.band=5ghz-a
Create configuration profile to be used by virtual AP interface
```
specify different WPA2 passphrase in configuration:
```
[admin@CM] /caps-man configuration> add name=slave-cfg ssid=slave security=wpa2psk
security.passphrase=87654321
Create provisioning rule that matches any radio and creates dynamic interfaces using master-cfg and slave-cfg:
[admin@CM] /caps-man provisioning> add action=create-dynamic-enabled master-configuration=master-cfg
slave-configurations=slave-cfg
Now when AP connects and is provisioned 2 dynamic interfaces (one master and one slave) will get created:
[admin@CM] /caps-man interface> print detail
Flags: M - master, D - dynamic, B - bound, X - disabled, I - inactive, R - running
0 MDB name="cap1" mtu=1500 l2mtu=2300 radio-mac=00:0C:42:1B:4E:F5 master-interface=none
configuration=master-cfg
1 DB name="cap2" mtu=1500 l2mtu=2300 radio-mac=00:00:00:00:00:00 master-interface=cap1
configuration=slave-cfg
Consider an AP, that does not support configured frequency connects and can not become operational:
[admin@CM] /caps-man interface> pr
Flags: M - master, D - dynamic, B - bound, X - disabled, I - inactive, R - running


# NAME RADIO-MAC MASTER-INTERFACE
0 MDB ;;; unsupported band or channel
cap3 00:0C:42:1B:4E:FF none
...
We can override channel settings for this particular radio in interface settings, without affecting master-cfg profile:
[admin@CM] /caps-man interface> set cap3 channel.frequency=2142 channel.band=2ghz-b/g
Allow Specific MAC address range to match the Access-list, for example, match all the Apple devices:
[admin@CM] /caps-man access-list> add mac-address=18:34:51:00:00:00 mac-address-mask=FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
action=accept
Configuring DHCP Server Option 138 for setting the CAPsMAN address on the CAP boards
[admin@CM] /ip dhcp-server network set <network-id> caps-manager=<capsman-server-ip>
DHCP client this CAPsMAN IP will see in "/ip dhcp-client print detail"
Configuration with certificates
You would want to configure certificates in your CAPsMAN to use options as Require Peer Certificate and Lock To Caps Man. These options increase
security and in some cases stability of your CAPsMAN network. CAPs won't connect to CAPsMAN without a specific certificate and vice versa.
Fast and easy configuration
This is a basic configuration for using certificates in your CAPsMAN setup. This example assumes that you already have basic configuration on your
CAPsMAN and CAP. It is best to use this configuration in CAPsMAN networks which are not constantly growing. For more details read about CAP to
CAPsMAN Connection.
CAPsMAN device:
In CAPsMAN Manager menu set Certificate and CA Certificate to auto:
/caps-man manager
set ca-certificate=auto certificate=auto
Print output:
[admin@CAPsMAN] /caps-man manager print
enabled: yes
certificate: auto
ca-certificate: auto
package-path:
upgrade-policy: none
require-peer-certificate: no
generated-certificate: CAPsMAN-D4CA6D987C26
generated-ca-certificate: CAPsMAN-CA-D4CA6D987C26
CAPsMAN device first will generate CA-Certificate and then it will generate Certificate which depends on CA-Certificate.
CAP device:
Set in CAP configuration to request certificate:
/interface wireless cap
set certificate=request
CAP will connect to CAPsMAN and request certificate. CAP will receive CA-Certificate form CAPsMAN and another certificate will be created for use on
CAP.
In Result
On CAP device in CAP menu Requested Certificate is set:
[admin@CAP] /interface wireless cap print
enabled: yes
interfaces: wlan1
certificate: request
lock-to-caps-man: no
discovery-interfaces: ether1
caps-man-addresses:
caps-man-names:
caps-man-certificate-common-names:
bridge: none
static-virtual: no
--> requested-certificate: CAP-D4CA6D7F45BA <--
Also, two certificates are gained and are seen in Certificate menu:
[admin@CAP] > /certificate print
Flags: K - private-key, D - dsa, L - crl, C - smart-card-key, A - authority, I - issued, R - revoked, E -

On CAPsMAN device in Certificate menu three certificates are created. CAPsMAN and CAPsMAN-CA certificates, as well as a certificate which is issued
to CAP:
[admin@CAPsMAN] > /certificate print
Flags: K - private-key, D - dsa, L - crl, C - smart-card-key, A - authority, I - issued, R - revoked, E -

Additionally
If you want to allow only CAPs with a valid certificate to connect to this CAPsMAN you can set Require Peer Certificate to yes on CAPsMAN device:
/caps-man manager
set require-peer-certificate=yes
However, when you will want to add new CAP devices to your CAPsMAN network you will have to set this option to no and then back to yes after CAP has
gained certificates. Every time you change this option CAPsMAN will drop all dynamic interfaces and CAPs will try to connect again.
If you want to lock CAP to specific CAPsMAN and be sure it won't connect to other CAPsMANs you should set option Lock To CAPsMAN to yes.
Additionally, you can specify CAPsMAN to lock to by setting CAPsMAN Certificate Common Names on CAP device:
/interface wireless cap
set lock-to-caps-man=yes
set caps-man-certificate-common-names=CAPsMAN-D4CA6D987C26
Manual certificates and issuing with SCEP
With this example, you can create your own certificates for CAPsMAN and take control over issuing certificates to CAPs. This configuration can be useful
in big, growing CAPsMAN networks. Many segments of this example can be done differently depending on your situation and needs. At this point, some
knowledge about Certificates and their application can be useful.
CAPsMAN device:
In Certificate menu add certificate templates for CA certificate and CAPsMAN server certificate:
/certificate
add name=CA-temp common-name=CA
add name=CAPsMAN-temp common-name=CAPsMAN
Now Sign the certifiace templates. First Sign the CA certificate and use CAPsMAN device IP as CA CRL Host:
/certificate
sign CA-temp ca-crl-host=10.5.138.157 name=CA
sign CAPsMAN-temp ca=CA name=CAPsMAN
Alternatively, previous two steps can be done with auto setting in Certificate and CA-Certificate option in CAPsMAN Manager menu, see the Fast and easy
configuration.
Export CA certificate. You will have to Import it on CAP device. You can use Download -> Drag&Drop to CAP device, in this example fetch command is
used later from CAP device. Using long passphrase is advisable - longer passphrase will take longer to crack if it gets into the wrong hands:
/certificate
export-certificate CA export-passphrase=thelongerthebetterpassphrase
Create SCEP server which will be used to issue and grant certificates to CAP devices:
/certificate scep-server
add ca-cert=CA path=/scep/CAPsMAN
Set certificates in CAPsMAN Manager menu and set Require Peer Certificate to yes:
/caps-man manager
set ca-certificate=CA certificate=CAPsMAN
set require-peer-certificate=yes
At this point, only CAPs with a valid certificate will be able to connect.
CAP device
Download export of CA certificate from CAPsMAN device to CAP device. In this example fetch is used, however, there are multiple other ways:
/tool fetch address=10.5.138.157 src-path=cert_export_CA.crt user=admin password="123" mode=ftp
Import CA certificate from CAPsMAN device in Certificate menu:
/certificate> import file-name=cert_export_CA.crt passphrase=thelongerthebetterpassphrase
Add certificate template for CAP:
/certificate
add name=CAP1 common-name=CAP1
Ask CAPsMAN device to grant this certificate with a key using SCEP:
/certificate
add-scep template=CAP1 scep-url="https://10.5.138.157/scep/CAPsMAN"
You will have to return to CAPsMAN device to grant key to this certificate.
In CAP menu set just created certificate:
/interface wireless cap
set certificate=CAP1
CAPsMAN device:
Return to CAPsMAN device to grant a key to CAP certificate in Certificate Request menu:
/certificate scep-server requests
grant numbers=0
In Result
Now CAP should be able to connect to CAPsMAN, see in CAPsMAN interfaces if it connects. In CAPsMAN device Certificate menu three certificates can
be seen: CA, CAPsMAN, and the one which is issued to CAP:
[admin@CAPsMAN] /certificate print

# HWMPplus mesh

## Summary
```
/interface mesh
```
HWMP+ is a MikroTik specific layer-2 routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. It is based on Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) from IEEE
802.11s draft standard. It can be used instead of (Rapid) Spanning Tree protocols in mesh setups to ensure loop-free optimal routing.
The HWMP+ protocol however is not compatible with HWMP from IEEE 802.11s draft standard.
Note that the distribution system you use for your network need not be a Wireless Distribution System (WDS). HWMP+ mesh routing supports not only
WDS interfaces but also Ethernet interfaces inside the mesh. So you can use a simple Ethernet-based distribution system, or you can combine both WDS
and Ethernet links!

Example
This example uses static WDS links that are dynamically added as mesh ports when they become active. Two different frequencies are used: one for AP
interconnections, and one for client connections to APs, so the AP must have at least two wireless interfaces. Of course, the same frequency for all
connections also could be used, but that might not work as well because of potential interference issues.
Repeat this configuration on all APs:
```
/interface mesh add disabled=no
/interface mesh port add interface=wlan1 mesh=mesh1
/interface mesh port add interface=wlan2 mesh=mesh1
```
```
# interface used for AP interconnections
/interface wireless set wlan1 disabled=no ssid=mesh frequency=2437 band=2ghz-b/g/n mode=ap-bridge \
wds-mode=static-mesh wds-default-bridge=mesh1
```
```
# interface used for client connections
/interface wireless set wlan2 disabled=no ssid=mesh-clients frequency=5180 band=5ghz-a/n/ac mode=ap-bridge
```
```
# a static WDS interface for each AP you want to connect to
/interface wireless wds add disabled=no master-interface=wlan1 name=<descriptive name of remote end> \
wds-address=<MAC address of remote end>
```
Here WDS interface is added manually because static WDS mode is used. If you are using wds-mode=dynamic-mesh, all WDS interfaces will be created
automatically. The frequency and band parameters are specified here only to produce valid example configuration; mesh protocol operations are by no
means limited to or optimized for, these particular values.
In real-world setups you also should take care of securing the wireless connections, using /interface wireless security-profile. For simplicity, that
configuration is not shown here.

Test if ping works:
```
[admin@A] > /ping 00:0C:42:00:00:CC
00:0C:42:00:00:CC 64 byte ping time=108 ms
00:0C:42:00:00:CC 64 byte ping time=51 ms
00:0C:42:00:00:CC 64 byte ping time=39 ms
00:0C:42:00:00:CC 64 byte ping time=43 ms
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 39/60.2/108 ms
```
Router A had to discover a path to Router C first, hence the slightly larger time for the first ping. Now the FDB also contains an entry for 00:0C:42:00:00:
CC, with type "mesh".
```
You may want to increase the disconnect-timeout wireless interface option to make the protocol more stable.
```
Also, test that ARP resolving works and so does IP level ping:
```
[admin@A] > /ping 10.4.0.3
10.4.0.3 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=163 ms
10.4.0.3 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=46 ms
10.4.0.3 64 byte ping: ttl=64 time=48 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 46/85.6/163 ms
```
Mesh traceroute
There is also a mesh traceroute command, that can help you to determine which paths are used for routing.
For example, for this network:
```
[admin@1] /interface mesh fdb print
Flags: A - active, R - root
MESH TYPE MAC-ADDRESS ON-INTERFACE LIFETIME AGE
A mesh1 local 00:0C:42:00:00:01 7m1s

A mesh1 mesh 00:0C:42:00:00:24 wds4 18s 3s
```
Traceroute to 00:0C:42:00:00:12 shows:
```

Protocol description
Reactive mode
```
Router A wants to discover a path to C
```
```
Router C sends a unicast response to A
```
In reactive mode, HWMP+ is very much like AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector). All paths are discovered on-demand, by flooding Path Request
(PREQ) message in the network. The destination node or some router that has a path to the destination will reply with a Path Response (PREP). Note that
if the destination address belongs to a client, the AP this client is connected to will serve as a proxy for him (i.e. reply to PREQs on his behalf).
This mode is best suited for mobile networks, and/or when most of the communication happens between intra-mesh nodes.
Proactive mode
```
The root announces itself by flooding RANN
```
```
Internal nodes respond with PREGs
```
In proactive mode, there are some routers configured as portals. In general, being a portal means that the router has interfaces to some other network, i.e.
it is an entry/exit point to the mesh network.
The portals will announce their presence by flooding the Root Announcement (RANN) message in the network. Internal nodes will reply with a Path
Registration (PREG) message. The result of this process will be routing trees with roots in the portal.
Routes to portals will serve as a kind of default route. If an internal router does not know the path to a particular destination, it will forward all data to its
closest portal. The portal will then discover the path on behalf of the router if needed. The data afterward will flow through the portal. This may lead to sub-
optimal routing unless the data is addressed to the portal itself or some external network the portals have interfaces to.
A proactive mode is best suited when most of the traffic goes between internal mesh nodes and a few portal nodes.
Topology change detection
```
Data flow path
```
```
After the link disappears, an error is propagated upstream
```
HWMP+ uses Path Error (PERR) message to notify that a link has disappeared. The message is propagated to all upstream nodes up to the data source.
The source on PERR reception restarts the path discovery process.
FAQ
Q. How is this better than RSTP?
A. It gives you optimal routing. RSTP is only for loop prevention.
Q. How the route selection is done?
A. The route with the best metric is always selected after the discovery process. There is also a configuration option to periodically reoptimize already
known routes.
Route metric is calculated as the sum of individual link metrics.
Link metric is calculated in the same way as for (R)STP protocols:
```
For Ethernet links the metric is configured statically (same as for OSPF, for example).
For WDS links the metric is updated dynamically depending on actual link bandwidth, which in turn is influenced by wireless signal strength, and
the selected data transfer rate.
```
Currently, the protocol does not take into account the amount of bandwidth being used on a link, but that might be also used in the future.
Q. How is this better than OSPF/RIP/layer-3 routing in general?
A. WDS networks usually are bridged, not routed. The ability to self-configure is important for mesh networks, and routing generally requires much more
configuration than bridging. Of course, you can always run any L3 routing protocol over a bridged network, but for mesh networks that usually makes little
sense.
Q. What about performance/CPU requirements?
A. The protocol itself, when properly configured, will take much fewer resources than OSPF (for example) would. Data forwarding performance on an
individual router should be close to that of bridging.
Q. How does it work together with existing mesh setups that are using RSTP?
A. The internal structure of an RSTP network is transparent to the mesh protocol (because mesh hello packets are forwarded inside the RSTP network).
The mesh will see the path between two entry points in the RSTP network as a single segment. On the other hand, a mesh network is not transparent to
the RSTP, since RSTP hello packets are not be forwarded inside the mesh network. (This is the behavior since v3.26)
Note that if you have a WDS link between two access points, then both ends must have the same configuration (either as ports in a mesh on both ends or
as ports in a bridge interface on both ends).
You can also put a bridge interface as a mesh port (to be able to use a bridge firewall, for example).
Q. Can I have multiple entry/exit points to the network?
A. If the entry/exit points are configured as portals (i.e. proactive mode is used), each router inside the mesh network will select its closest portal and
forward all data to it. The portal will then discover a path on behalf of the router if needed.
Q. How to control or filter mesh traffic?
A. At the moment the only way is to use a bridge firewall. Create a bridge interface, put the WDS interfaces and/or Ethernets in that bridge, and put that
bridge in a mesh interface. Then configure bridge firewall rules.
To match MAC protocol used for mesh traffic encapsulation, use MAC protocol number 0x9AAA, and to match mesh routing traffic, use MAC protocol
number 0x9AAB. Example:
```
interface bridge settings set use-ip-firewall=yes
interface bridge filter add chain=input action=log mac-protocol=0x9aaa
interface bridge filter add chain=input action=log mac-protocol=0x9aab
```
Advanced topics
We all know that it's easy to make problematic layer-2 bridging or routing setups and it can be hard to debug them. (Compared to layer-3 routing setups.)
So here are a few bad configuration examples that could create problems for you. Avoid them!
Problematic example 1: Ethernet switch inside a mesh
```
Since optimized layer-2 multicast forwarding is not included in the mesh protocol, it is better to avoid forwarding any multicast traffic (including
OSPF) over meshed networks. If you need OSPF, then you have to configure OSPF NBMA neighbors that use unicast mode instead.
```
```
Routing loops are possible if a mesh network is attached to an RSTP network in two or more points!
```
```
It is perfectly possible to create mixed mesh/bridge setups that will not work (e.g. Problematic example 1 with bridge instead of a switch). The
recommended fail-safe way that will always work is to create a separate bridge interface per each of the physical interfaces; then add all these
bridge interfaces as mesh ports.
```

### 1.

### 2.
Router A is outside the mesh, all the rest of the routers are inside. For routers B, C, D all interfaces are added as mesh ports.
Router A will not be able to communicate reliably with router C. The problem manifests itself when D is the designated router for Ethernet; if B takes this
role, everything is OK. The main cause of the problem is MAC address learning on Ethernet switch.
Consider what happens when router A wants to send something to C. We suppose router A either knows or floods data to all interfaces. Either way, data
arrives at the switch. The switch, not knowing anything about the destination's MAC address, forwards the data to both B and D.
What happens now:
```
B receives the packet on a mesh interface. Since the MAC address is not local for B and B knows that he is not the designated router for the
Ethernet network, he simply ignores the packet.
D receives the packet on a mesh interface. Since the MAC address is not local for B and D is the designated router for the Ethernet network, he
initiates the path discovery process to C.
```
After path discovery is completed, D has information that C is reachable over B. Now D encapsulates the packet and forwards it back to the Ethernet
network. The encapsulated packet is forwarded by the switch, received and forwarded by B, and received by C. So far everything is good.
Now C is likely to respond to the packet. Since B already knows where A is, he will decapsulate and forward the reply packet. But now the switch will learn
that the MAC address of C is reachable through B! That means, next time when something arrives from A addressed to C, the switch will forward data only t
o B (and B, of course, will silently ignore the packet)!
In contrast, if B took up the role of a designated router, everything would be OK, because traffic would not have to go through the Ethernet switch twice.
Troubleshooting: either avoid such setup or disable MAC address learning on the switch. Note that on many switches that is not possible.
Also note that there will be no problem, if either:
```
router A supports and is configured to use HWMP+;
or Ethernet switch is replaced with a router that supports HWMP+ and has Ethernet interfaces added as mesh ports.
```
Problematic example 2: wireless modes
Consider this (invalid) setup example:

### 1.

### 2.
Routers A and B are inside the mesh, router C: outside. For routers A and B all interfaces are added as mesh ports.
It is not possible to bridge wlan1 and wlan2 on router B now. The reason for this is pretty obvious if you understand how WDS works. For WDS
communications four address frames are used. This is because for wireless multihop forwarding you need to know both the addresses of the intermediate
hops, as well as the original sender and final receiver. In contrast, non-WDS 802.11 communication includes only three MAC addresses in a frame. That's
why it's not possible to do multi-hop forwarding in station mode.
Troubleshooting: depends on what you want to achieve:
```
If you want router C to act as a repeater either for wireless or Ethernet traffic, configure the WDS link between router B and router C, and run
mesh routing protocol on all nodes.
In other cases configure wlan2 on router B in AP mode and WLAN on router C in station mode.
```

```
Nv2 protocol is a proprietary wireless protocol developed by MikroTik for use with Atheros 802.11 wireless chips. Nv2 is based on TDMA (Time Division
Multiple Access) media access technology instead of CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) media access technology used in regular 802.11 devices.
TDMA media access technology solves hidden node problem and improves media usage, thus improving throughput and latency, especially in PtMP
networks.
Nv2 is supported for Atheros 802.11n chips and legacy 802.11a/b/g chips starting from AR5212, but not supported on older AR5211 and AR5210 chips.
This means that both - 11n and legacy devices can participate in the same network and it is not required to upgrade hardware to implement Nv2 in network.
Media access in Nv2 network is controlled by Nv2 Access Point. Nv2 AP divides time into fixed size "periods" which are dynamically divided into downlink
(data sent from AP to clients) and uplink (data sent from clients to AP) portions, based on the queue state on AP and clients. Uplink time is further divided
between connected clients based on their requirements for bandwidth. At the beginning of each period, AP broadcasts a schedule that tells clients when
they should transmit and the amount of time they can use.
In order to allow new clients to connect, Nv2 AP periodically assigns uplink time for "unspecified" client - this time interval is then used by a fresh client to
initiate registration to AP. Then AP estimates propagation delay between AP and client and starts periodically scheduling uplink time for this client in order
to complete registration and receive data from client.
Nv2 implements dynamic rate selection on a per-client basis and ARQ for data transmissions. This enables reliable communications across Nv2 links.
For QoS Nv2 implements variable number of priority queues with built-in default QoS scheduler that can be accompanied with fine-grained QoS policy
based on firewall rules or priority information propagated across network using VLAN priority or MPLS EXP bits.
Nv2 protocol limit is 511 clients per interface.

## Nv2 protocol implementation status
Nv2 has the following features:
```
TDMA media access
WDS support
QoS support with variable number or priority queues
data encryption
RADIUS authentication features
statistics fields
Fixed Downlink mode support
Uplink/Downlink ratio support
Nv2 AP synchronization experimental support
```

## Compatibility and coexistence with other wireless protocols
Nv2 protocol is not compatible to or based on any other available wireless protocols or implementations, either TDMA based or any other kind. This implies
that only Nv2 supporting and enabled devices can participate in Nv2 network.
Regular 802.11 devices will not recognize and will not be able to connect to Nv2 AP. RouterOS devices that have Nv2 support (that is - have RouterOS
version 5.0rc1 or higher) will see Nv2 APs when issuing scan command, but will only connect to Nv2 AP if properly configured.
As Nv2 does not use CSMA technology it may disturb any other network in the same channel. In the same way other networks may disturb Nv2 network,
because every other signal is considered noise.
The key points regarding compatibility and coexistence:
```
only RouterOS devices will be able to participate in Nv2 network
only RouterOS devices will see Nv2 AP when scanning
Nv2 network will disturb other networks in the same channel
Nv2 network may be affected by any (Nv2 or not) other networks in the same channel
Nv2 enabled device will not connect to any other TDMA based network
```
How Nv2 compares with Nstreme and 802.11
Nv2 vs 802.11
The key differences between Nv2 and 802.11:
```
Media access is scheduled by AP - this eliminates hidden node problem and allows to implement centralized media access policy - AP controls
how much time is used by every client and can assign time to clients according to some policy instead of every device contending for media
access.
Reduced propagation delay overhead - There are no per-frame ACKs in Nv2 - this significantly improves throughput, especially on long-distance
links where data frame and following ACK frame propagation delay significantly reduces the effectiveness of media usage.
Reduced per frame overhead - Nv2 implements frame aggregation and fragmentation to maximize assigned media usage and reduce per-frame
overhead (interframe spaces, preambles).
```
Nv2 vs Nstreme
The key differences between Nv2 and Nstreme:
```
Reduced polling overhead - instead of polling each client, Nv2 AP broadcasts an uplink schedule that assigns time to multiple clients, this can be
considered "group polling" - no time is wasted for polling each client individually, leaving more time for actual data transmission. This improves
throughput, especially in PtMP configurations.
Reduced propagation delay overhead - Nv2 must not poll each client individually, this allows to create uplink schedule based on estimated
distance (propagation delay) to clients such that media usage is most effective. This improves throughput, especially in PtMP configurations.
More control over latency - reduced overhead, adjustable period size and QoS features allows for more control over latency in the network.
```
Configuring Nv2
wireless-protocol setting controls which wireless protocol selects and uses. Note that the meaning of this setting depends on the interface role (either it is
AP or client) that depends on interface mode setting. Find possible values of wireless-protocol and their meaning in table below.
```

```
```
Nv2-
nstreme
```
```
establish Nv2 network scan for Nv2 networks, if suitable network found - connect, otherwise scan for Nstreme networks and
if suitable network found - connect
```
Note that wireless-protocol values Nv2-nstreme-802.11 and Nv2-nstreme DO NOT specify some hybrid or special kind of protocol - these values are
implemented to simplify client configuration when protocol of network that client must connect to can change. Using these values can help in migrating
network to Nv2 protocol.
Most of Nv2 settings are significant only to Nv2 AP - Nv2 client automatically adapts necessary settings from AP. The following settings are relevant to Nv2
AP:
```
Nv2-queue-count - specifies how many priority queues are used in Nv2 network. For more details see QoS in Nv2 network
Nv2-qos - controls frame to priority queue mapping policy. For more details see QoS in Nv2 network
Nv2-cell-radius - specifies distance to farthest client in Nv2 network in km. This setting affects the size of contention time slot that AP allocates for
clients to initiate connection and also size of time slots used for estimating distance to client. If this setting is too small, clients that are farther
away may have trouble connecting and/or disconnect with "ranging timeout" error. Although during normal operation the effect of this setting
should be negligible, in order to maintain maximum performance, it is advised to not increase this setting if not necessary, so AP is not reserving
time that is actually never used, but instead allocates it for actual data transfer.
tdma-period-size - specifies size in ms of time periods that Nv2 AP uses for media access scheduling. Smaller period can potentially decrease
latency (because AP can assign time for client sooner), but will increase protocol overhead and therefore decrease throughput. On the other hand
```
- increasing period will increase throughput but also increase latency. It may be required to increase this value for especially long links to get
acceptable throughput. This necessity can be caused by the fact that there is "propagation gap" between downlink (from AP to clients) and uplink
(from clients to AP) data during which no data transfer is happening. This gap is necessary because client must receive last frame from AP - this
happens after propagation delay after AP's transmission, and only then client can transmit - as a result frame from client arrives at AP after
propagation delay after client's transmission (so the gap is propagation delay times two). The longer the distance, the bigger is necessary
propagation gap in every period. If propagation gap takes significant portion of period, actual throughput may become unacceptable and period
size should get increased at the expense of increased latency. Basically value of this setting must be carefully chosen to maximize throughput but
also to keep latency at acceptable levels.
Nv2-mode - specifies to use dynamic or fixed downlink/uplink ratio. Default value is "dynamic-downlink";
"sync-master" - works as nv2-mode=fixed-downlink (so uses nv2-downlink-ratio), but allows slaves to sync to this master; "sync-slave" - tries to sync to
master (or already synced slave) and adapt period-size and downlink ratio settings from master.
```
Nv2-downlink-ratio - specifies the Nv2 downlink ratio. Uplink ratio is automatically calculated from the downlink-ratio value. When using dynamic-
downlink mode the downlink-ratio is also used when link get fully saturated. Minimum value is 20 and maximum 80. Default value is 50.
```
The follwing settings are significant on both - Nv2 AP and Nv2 client:
```
Nv2-security - specifies Nv2 security mode, for more details see Security in Nv2 network
Nv2-preshared-key - specifies preshared key to be used, for more details see Security in Nv2 network
nv2-sync-secret - specifies secret key for use in the Nv2 synchronization. Secret should match on Master and Slave devices in order to establish
the synced state.
```
Migrating to Nv2
Using wireless-protocol setting aids in migration or evaluating Nv2 protocol in existing networks really simple and reduce downtime as much as possible.
These are the recommended steps:
```
upgrade AP to version that supports Nv2, but do not enable Nv2 on AP yet.
upgrade clients to version that supports Nv2
configure all clients with wireless-protocol=Nv2-nstreme-802.11. Clients will still connect to AP using protocol that was used previously, because
AP is not changed over to Nv2 yet
configure Nv2 related settings on AP
if it is necessary to use data encryption and secure authentication, configure Nv2 security related settings on AP and clients (refer to Security in
Nv2 network).
set wireless-protocol=Nv2 on AP. This will make AP to change to Nv2 protocol. Clients should now connect using Nv2 protocol.
in case of some trouble you can easily switch back to previous protocol by simply changing it back to whatever was used before on AP.
fine tune Nv2 related settings to get acceptable latency and throughput
implement QoS policy for maximum performance.
```
The basic troubleshooting guide:
```
clients have trouble connecting or disconnect with "ranging timeout" error - check that Nv2-cell-radius setting is set appropriately
unexpectedly low throughput on long distance links although signal and rate is fine - try to increase tdma-period-size setting
```
Nv2 AP Synchronization
This feature will let multiple MikroTik Nv2 APs on the same location to coexist in a better fashion by reducing the interference between each other. This
feature will synchronize the transmit/receive time windows of APs in the same frequency, so that all synced MikroTik Nv2 APs transmits/receives at the
same time. That allows to reuse the same wireless frequency on the location for multiple APs giving more flexibility in frequency planning.
To make Nv2 synced setup:
```
For Nv2 Synchronization a Master Nv2 AP should be chosen and "nv2-mode=sync-master" should be specified together with "nv2-sync-secret".
For Nv2 Slave APs the same wireless frequency as Master AP should be used and "nv2-mode=sync-slave" should be specified with the same
"nv2-sync-secret" as the in Master AP configuration.
When Master AP is enabled Slave APs will try start searching for Master AP by matching it against specified "nv2-sync-secret".
After Master AP is found the Slave AP will calculate the distance to the Master AP as it is possible that Master AP is located not on the same
location.
Then Slave AP starts operating as AP and it adapts the period size and downlink ratio from the synced Master AP.
In addition after the Slave AP is operational other Slave APs can use this Slave AP to sync with.
Slave AP periodically listens for the Master AP and checks if the "nv2-sync-secret" still matches and adapts the parameters again. If Master AP
interface is disabled/enabled all the Slaves will be also disabled and will start the synchronization process from the beginning.
If Master AP stops working Slave APs also will stop working as they do not have sync information.
```

/interface wireless set wlan1 mode=ap-bridge ssid=Sector1 frequency=5220 nv2-mode=sync-master nv2-preshared-

QoS in Nv2 network
QoS in Nv2 is implemented by means of variable number of priority queues. Queue is considered for transmission based on rule recommended by 802.1D-
2004 - only if all higher priority queues are empty. In practice this means that at first all frames from queue with higher priority will be sent, and only then
next queue is considered. Therefore QoS policy must be designed with care so that higher priority queues do not make lower priority queues starve.
QoS policy in Nv2 network is controlled by AP, clients adapt policy from AP. On AP QoS policy is configured with Nv2-queue-count and Nv2-qos
parameters. Nv2-queue-count parameter specifies number of priority queues used. Mapping of frames to queues is controlled by Nv2-qos parameter.
Nv2-qos=default
In this mode outgoing frame at first is inspected by built-in QoS policy algorithm that selects queue based on packet type and size. If built-in rules do not
match, queue is selected based on frame priority field, as in Nv2-qos=frame-priority mode.
Nv2-qos=frame-priority
In this mode QoS queue is selected based on frame priority field. Note that frame priority field is not some field in headers and therefore it is valid only
while packet is processed by given device. Frame priority field must be set either explicitly by firewall rules or implicitly from ingress priority by frame
forwarding process, for example, from MPLS EXP bits. For more information on frame priority field see:
```
EXP bit and MPLS Queuing
WMM and VLAN priority
```
Queue is selected based on frame priority according to 802.1D recommended user priority to traffic class mapping. Mapping depends on number of
available queues (Nv2-queue-count parameter). For example, if number of queues is 4, mapping is as follows (pay attention how this mapping resembles
mapping used by WMM):
```
priority 0,3 -> queue 0
priority 1,2 -> queue 1
priority 4,5 -> queue 2
priority 6,7 -> queue 3
```
If number of queues is 2 (default), mapping is as follows:
```
priority 0,1,2,3 -> queue 0
priority 4,5,6,7 -> queue 1
```
If number of queues is 8 (maximum possible), mapping is as follows:
```
priority 1 -> queue 0
priority 2 -> queue 1
priority 0 -> queue 2
priority 3 -> queue 3
priority 4 -> queue 4
priority 5 -> queue 5
priority 6 -> queue 6
priority 7 -> queue 7
```
For other mappings, discussion on rationale for these mappings and recommended practices please see 802.1D-2004.
Security in Nv2 network
Nv2 security implementation has the following features:
```
hardware accelerated data encryption using AES-CCM with 128 bit keys;
4-way handshake for key management (similar to that of 802.11i);
preshared key authentication method (similar to that of 802.11i);
periodically updated group keys (used for broadcast and multicast data).
```
Being proprietary protocol Nv2 does not use security mechanisms of 802.11, therefore security configuration is different. Interface using Nv2 protocol
ignores security-profile setting. Instead, security is configured by the following interface settings:
```
Nv2-security - this setting enables/disables use of security in Nv2 network. Note that when security is enabled on AP, it will not accept clients with
disabled security. In the same way clients with enabled security will not connect to unsecure APs.
```
Nv2-preshared-key - preshared key to use for authentication. Data encryption keys are derived from preshared key during 4-way handshake.
Preshared key must be the same in order for 2 devices to establish connection. If preshared key will differ, connection will time out because
remote party will not be able to correctly interpret key exchange messages.

## Interworking
Interworking is the occurrence of two or more things working together. For a better Wireless network experience information about the network must be
exchanged between Access Points and Wireless client devices, the information that can be found in basic Wireless beacons and probe requests is limited.
For this reason, the IEEE 802.11u™-2011 (Interworking with External Networks) standard was created, that specifies how devices should exchange
information between each other. Network discovery and Access Point selection process can be enhanced with the interworking service. Wireless client
devices can have more criteria upon which they can choose the network with which to associate.

## Hotspot 2.0
Hotspot 2.0 is a specification developed and owned by the Wi-Fi Alliance. It was designed to enable a more cellular-like experience when connecting to Wi-
Fi networks. In the attempt to increase Wireless network security Hotspot 2.0 access points use mandatory WPA2 authentication. Hotspot 2.0 relies on
Interworking as well as adds some of its own properties and procedures.
Interworking profiles are implemented according to IEEE 802.11u and Hotspot 2.0 Release 1 specifications.

## Configuration Properties

## Information elements in beacon and probe response
Some information can be added to beacon and probe response packets with a Interworking element. Following parameters of a Interworking element can
be configured:
```
Property Description
```
```
asra (yes | no; Default: no) Additional Steps Required for Access. Set to yes, if a user should take additional steps to access the internet,
like the walled garden.
```
```
esr (yes | no; Default: no) Emergency services reachable (ESR). Set to yes in order to indicate that emergency services are reachable
through the access point.
```
```
hessid (MAC address; Default: ) Homogenous extended service set identifier (HESSID). Devices that provide access to same external
networks are in one homogenous extended service set. This service set can be identified by HESSID that is
the same on all access points in this set. 6-byte value of HESSID is represented as MAC address. It should
be globally unique, therefore it is advised to use one of the MAC address of access point in the service set.
```
```
This manual page describes the configuration of the regular wireless package, the same parameters are available in the WifiWave2 package as
well.
```
```
internet (yes | no; Default: yes) Whether the internet is available through this connection or not. This information is included in the
Interworking element.
```
```
network-type (emergency-only |
personal-device | private | private-
with-guest | public-chargeable |
public-free | test | wildcard; Default:
wildcard)
```
```
Information about network access type.
```
```
emergency-only - a network dedicated and limited to accessing emergency services;
personal-device - a network of personal devices. An example of this type of network is a camera that
is attached to a printer, thereby forming a network for the purpose of printing pictures;
private - network for users with user accounts. Usually used in enterprises for employees, not guests;
private-with-guest - same as private, but guest accounts are available;
public-chargeable - a network that is available to anyone willing to pay. For example, a subscription
to Hotspot 2.0 service or in-room internet access in a hotel;
public-free - network is available to anyone without any fee. For example, municipal network in city
or airport Hotspot;
test - network used for testing and experimental uses. Not used in production;
wildcard - is used on Wireless clients. Sending probe request with a wildcard as network type value
will make all Interworking Access Points respond despite their actual network-type setting.
```
```
A client sends a probe request frame with network-type set to value it is interested in. It will receive replies
only from access points with the same value (except the case of wildcard).
```
```
uesa (yes | no; Default: no) Unauthenticated emergency service accessible (UESA).
```
```
no - indicates that no unauthenticated emergency services are reachable through this Access Point;
yes - indicates that higher layer unauthenticated emergency services are reachable through this Access
Point.
```
```
venue (venue; Default: unspecified) Specify the venue in which the Access Point is located. Choose the value from available ones. Some
examples:
venue=business-bank
venue=mercantile-shopping-mall
venue=educational-university-or-college
```
ANQP elements
Access network query protocol (ANQP). Not all necessary information is included in probe response and beacon frames. For client device to get more
information before choosing access point to associate with ANQP is used. The Access Point can have stored information in multiple ANQP elements.
Client device will use ANQP to query only for the information it is interested in. This reduces the time needed before association.
```
Property Description
```
```
3gpp-raw (octet string in hex; Default: ) Cellular network advertisement information - country and network codes. This helps Hotspot
2.0 clients in the selection of an Access Point to access 3GPP network. Please see 3GPP TS
24.302. (Annex H) for a format of this field. This value is sent ANQP response if queried.
```
```
3gpp-info (number/number; Default: ) Cellular network advertisement information - country and network codes. This helps Hotspot
2.0 clients in the selection of an Access Point to access 3GPP network.  Written as "mcc
/mnc". Usage is identical to "3gpp-raw", but without using hex. Multiple mcc/mnc pairs can be
defined, by separating them with a comma.
```
```
authentication-types (dns-redirection:url | https-
redirection:url | online-enrollment:url | terms-
and-conditions:url; Default: )
```
```
This property is only effective when asra is set to yes. Value of url is optional and not
needed if dns-redirection or online-enrollment is selected. To set the value of url to
empty string use double quotes. For example:
```
```
authentication-types=online-enrollment:""
```
```
connection-capabilities (number:number:
closed|open|unknown; Default: )
```
```
This option allows to provide information about the allowed IP protocols and ports. This
information can be provided in ANQP response. The first number represents the IP protocol
number, the second number represents a port number.
```
```
closed - set if protocol and port combination is not allowed;
open - set if protocol and port combination is allowed;
unknown - set if protocol and port combination is either open or closed.
```
```
Example:
```
```
connection-capabilities=6:80:open,17:5060:closed
```
```
Setting such a value on an Access Point informs the Wireless client, which is connecting to
the Access Point, that HTTP (6 - TCP, 80 - HTTP) is allowed and VoIP (17 - UDP; 5060 -
VoIP) is not allowed.
This property does not restrict or allow usage of these protocols and ports, it only gives
information to station device which is connecting to Access Point.
```
```
domain-names (list of strings; Default: ) None or more fully qualified domain names (FQDN) that indicate the entity operating the
Hotspot. A station that is connecting to the Access Point can request this AQNP property and

```
Realms raw
realms-raw - list of strings with hex values. Each string specifies contents of "NAI Realm Tuple", excluding "NAI Realm Data Field Length" field.
Each hex encoded string must consist of the following fields:
- NAI Realm Encoding (1 byte)
- NAI Realm Length (1 byte)
- NAI Realm (variable)
- EAP Method Count (1 byte)
- EAP Method Tuples (variable)
For example, value "00045465737401020d00" decodes as:
- NAI Realm Encoding: 0 (rfc4282)
- NAI Realm Length: 4
- NAI Realm: Test
- EAP Method Count: 1
- EAP Method Length: 2
- EAP Method Tuple: TLS, no EAP method parameters
Note, that setting "realms-raw=00045465737401020d00" produces the same advertisement contents as setting "realms=Test:eap-tls".
Refer to 802.11-2016, section 9.4.5.10 for full NAI Realm encoding.

Configuration guide using native RadSec and Orion Wifi:
This guide describes how to set up your MikroTik devices so you can use them with RadSec proxy and Orion Wifi, though the main configuration steps
remain the same and will work with different providers as well:
Make sure to use the latest long-term or stable RouterOS releases.
It is important to set up a secure RADIUS connection between the wireless LAN controller and Orion Wifi.
Orion Wifi uses RADIUS over TLS (RadSec) to ensure end-to-end encryption of AAA traffic.
1) Import RadSec certificates you have downloaded from the Orion:
Drag and drop certificate in WinBox, and then use the import function for it, which can be found under /system certificates in WinBox, command line
equivalent is :"/certificate import file-name=bw.radsec.cacert.pem passphrase=""", "/certificate import file-name=cert.pem passphrase=""", "/certificate
import file-name=key.pem passphrase="""
Once certificates are imported, they should look like this:
2) Configure the Radius client
Command line equivalent: "/radius add address=216.239.32.91 certificate=cert.pem_0 protocol=radsec service=wireless timeout=1s500ms"
3)  Create a wireless security profile that would perform 802.1x authentication
Command line equivalent is “/interface wireless security-profiles add authentication-types=wpa2-eap management-protection=allowed mode=dynamic-
keys name=dot1x_profile supplicant-identity="" radius-eap-accounting=yes eap-methods=passthrough“.
4) The next step is configuring the wireless interface and assigning the created security profile. Press “Advanced mode” to see all the options.
Command line equivalent is: "/interface wireless set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] mode=ap-bridge security-profile=dot1x_profile wps-mode=disabled".
Make sure the correct country profile is configured. In this example, we are using “wlan1”, but the same command would work with other interfaces, or as “/i
nterface wireless set wlan1”.
5) Configure interworking settings (hotspot 2.0 ).
Command line equivalent: “/interface wireless interworking-profile add domain-names=orion.area120.com ipv4-availability=public name=Orion_MikroTik
network-type=public-chargeable operator-names=Orion:eng realms=orion.area120.com:eap-tls roaming-ois=f4f5e8f5f4,baa2D00100,baa2d00000
venue=business-unspecified venue-names=Orion:eng wan-downlink=50 wan-uplink=50 wan-status=up”.
6) Assign the interworking profile to the interface.
```
Pay special attention to "wan-downlink" and "wan-uplink", in this scenario value of "50" is used as a placeholder, make sure to adjust the values
according to your setup, some client devices use it to evaluate, if they should join the network. Set “venue” – venue type, ”venue-names” and
other attributes as applicable. “domain-names” should be of hotspot 2.0 Operator.
```
Command-line equivalent is: “/interface wireless set wlan1 interworking-profile=Orion_MikroTik”. If you don't see the interworking-profile field, press
"Advanced mode".
Note: NAS-id that's used by Orion to differentiate networks is equal to system identity, to adjust the nas-id, you can do "/system identity set
name=exampleName". Graphical interface support for interworking profiles are added from versions above 6.47.10, 6.48.3.
Configuration guide using RadSec proxy and Orion Wifi:
This guide describes how to set up your MikroTik devices so you can use them with RadSec proxy and Orion Wifi, though the main configuration steps
remain the same and will work with different providers as well:
This guide assumes that you have configured a radsecproxy with Orion Wifi credentials. Make sure to use the latest long-term or stable RouterOS releases.
It is important to set up a secure RADIUS connection between the wireless LAN controller and Orion Wifi.
Orion Wifi uses RADIUS over TLS (RadSec) to ensure end-to-end encryption of AAA traffic. This guide is made for scenarios where the RouterOS access
point redirects AAA traffic to a RadSec proxy (radsecproxy) before the traffic is sent over the internet.
1) Configure the Radius client that points to radsecproxy.
Command line equivalent is “/radius add address=192.168.88.233 secret=yourSecret service=wireless timeout=1s500ms”
The secret should match the one configured on the radsecproxy, in this example “192.168.88.233” is a virtual machine running the proxy.
2) Create a wireless security profile that would perform 802.1x authentication
Command line equivalent is “/interface wireless security-profiles add authentication-types=wpa2-eap management-protection=allowed mode=dynamic-
keys name=dot1x_profile supplicant-identity="" radius-eap-accounting=yes eap-methods=passthrough“.
3) The next step is configuring the wireless interface and assigning the created security profile. Press “Advanced mode” to see all the options.
Command line equivalent is: "/interface wireless set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] mode=ap-bridge security-profile=dot1x_profile wps-mode=disabled".
Make sure the correct country profile is configured. In this example, we are using “wlan1”, but the same command would work with other interfaces, or as “/i
nterface wireless set wlan1”.
4) Configure interworking settings (hotspot 2.0 ).
Command line equivalent: “/interface wireless interworking-profile add domain-names=orion.area120.com ipv4-availability=public name=Orion_MikroTik
network-type=public-chargeable operator-names=Orion:eng realms=orion.area120.com:eap-tls roaming-ois=f4f5e8f5f4,baa2D00100,baa2d00000
venue=business-unspecified venue-names=Orion:eng wan-downlink=50 wan-uplink=50 wan-status=up”.
5) Assign the interworking profile to the interface.
```
Be sure to specify somevalue in "wan-downlink" and "wan-uplink", in this scenario value of "50" is used as a placeholder, some client devices
use it to evaluate, if they should join the network. Set “venue” – venue type, ”venue-names” and other attributes as applicable. “domain-names”
should be of hotspot 2.0 Operator.
```
This step can also be done with the following command: “/interface wireless set wlan1 interworking-profile=Orion_MikroTik”.
If the radsecproxy is working, then clients with the appropriate Hotspot profile installed should be able to connect.
Note: NAS-id that's used by Orion to differentiate networks is equal to system identity, to adjust the nas-id, you can do "/system identity set
name=exampleName". Graphical interface support for interworking profiles is added from versions above 6.47.10, 6.48.3.
Troubleshooting
To check the status of RADIUS messages, you can use the radius menu.
Or alternatively via the command line run "/radius monitor X", X being the numerical ID, you can see the IDs with "/radius print".
For more information, additional logging can be configured under "/system logging add topics=radius,debug,packet". You can view results under "/log".
To view active wireless connections check the wireless registration table (/interface wireless registration-table print)

# Enterprise wireless security with User Manager v5
User Manager version 5 ( available for RouterOS v7 ) supports user authentication via the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
This guide will explain the steps needed to configure User Manager v5 as the authentication server for MikroTik wireless access points with users being
offered PEAP and EAP-TLS authentication methods.
The guide assumes a standalone device running User Manager at the network address 10.0.0.10 and 2 Access Points - one at 10.0.0.11 and the other at
10.0.0.12

## Installing User Manager
User Manager v5 can be found in the 'Extra packages' archive for the latest release of RouterOS v7.
Download the archive for the appropriate CPU architecture, extract it, upload the User Manager package to  the router and reboot it.

## Generating TLS certificates
When using secure EAP methods, the client device (supplicant) verifies the identity of the authenication server before sending its own credentials to it.
For this to happen, the authentication server needs a TLS certificate.
This certificate should:
```
Be valid and signed by a certificate authority which is trusted by the client device
Have a fully qualified domain name in the Common Name (CN) and Subject Alt Name fields
Have the Extended Key Usage attribute indicating that it is authorized for authentcating a TLS server
Have Validity period of no more than 825 days
```
The EAP-TLS method requires the client device to have a TLS certificate (instead of a password).
To be considered valid by User Manager, a client certificate must:
```
Be valid and signed by an authority, which is trusted by the device running User Manager
Have the user name in the Subject Alt Name (SAN) field. For backward compatibility, you can also add it in the CN field. For more information
please see: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5216#section-5.2
```
Finally, the WPA3 enterprise specification includes an extra secure mode, which provides 192-bit cryptographic security.
This mode requires using EAP-TLS with certificates that:
```
Use either P-384 elliptic curve keys or RSA keys which are at least 3072 bits in length
Use SHA384 as the digest (hashing) algorithm
```
For the sake of brevity (and to showcase more of RouterOS' capabilities), this guide will show how to generate all the certificates on the device running
User Manager, but in a large scale enterprise environment, the authentication server and client devices would each generate private keys and certificate
signing requests locally, then upload CSRs to a certificate authority for signing.
```
Commands executed on device running User Manager
```

properties, if specified, override profile properties
/interface/wifiwave2 set [find] security.authentication-types=wpa2-eap,wpa3-eap
```
A wifiwave2 AP can  also be configured to use the extra secure wpa3-eap-192 mode, but note that it requires that all client devices support the GCMP-256
cipher and use EAP-TLS authentication.
Notes on client device configuration
Windows
When manually installing a CA in Windows, make sure to explicitly place it in the 'Trusted Root Certification Authorities' certificate store. It will not be
placed there automatically.
Android
When connecting to a network with EAP authentication, Android devices ask the user to specify a 'domain'. This refers to the expected domain of the host
name included in the RADIUS server's TLS certificate ( 'mikrotik.test' in our example).
By default, Android devices use the device's built-in root CA list for validating the RADIUS server's certificate. When using your own CA, it needs to be
selected in the appropriate dropdown menu.
iOS
Apple iOS does not appear to actually trust a manually imported CA to authenticate RADIUS servers. The server certificate is marked as 'Not Trusted'
unless the CA was imported using Apple's proprietary 'Configurator' utility or an approved third party MDM tool.


# VLANs on Wireless

## Summary
VLANs provide the possibility to isolate devices into different Layer2 segments while still using the same Layer1 medium. This is very useful in setups
where you want to separate different types of devices of users. This feature is also very useful for Wireless setups since you can isolate different Virtual
APs and restricting access to certain services or networks by using Firewall. Below is an example with a setup with two Access Points on the same device
that isolates them into saparate VLANs. This kind of scenario is very common when you have a Guest AP and Work AP.

## Example
Bridge VLAN Filtering since RouterOS v6.41 provides VLAN aware Layer2 forwarding and VLAN tag modifications within the bridge.
R1:
```
Add necessary VLAN interfaces on ethernet interface to make it a VLAN trunk port. Add ip addresses on VLAN interfaces.
```
```
[admin@R1] >
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=vlan111 vlan-id=111
add interface=ether1 name=vlan222 vlan-id=222
```
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=vlan111
add address=192.168.2.1/24 interface=vlan222
```

### R2:
```
Add VirtualAP under wlan1 interface and create wireless security-profiles for wlan1 and wlan2
```
```
[admin@R2] >
/interface wireless
set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] disabled=no mode=ap-bridge security-profile=vlan111 ssid=vlan111 vlan-id=111
vlan-mode=use-tag
add disabled=no master-interface=wlan1 name=wlan2 security-profile=vlan222 ssid=vlan222 vlan-id=222 vlan-
mode=use-tag
```
```
Create bridge with vlan-filtering=yes
Add necessary bridge ports
Add tagged interfaces under interface bridge vlan section with correct vlan-ids
```
```
[admin@R2] >
/interface bridge
add fast-forward=no name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
```
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wlan1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wlan2
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,wlan1 vlan-ids=111
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether2,wlan2 vlan-ids=222
```

### R3:
```
Add IP address on wlan1 interface.
Create wireless security-profile compatible with R2 wlan1.
```
```
[admin@R3] >
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.3/24 interface=wlan1
```
```
/interface wireless
set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] disabled=no security-profile=vlan111
```

### R4:
```
Add IP address on wlan1 interface.
Create wireless security-profile compatible with R2 wlan2.
```
```
[admin@R4] >
/ip address
add address=192.168.2.4/24 interface=wlan1
```
```
/interface wireless
set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] disabled=no security-profile=vlan222
```
```
It is important to set wlan1,wlan2 vlan-mode to "use-tag".
```
```
Some devices have a built-in switch chip that can switch packets between Ethernet ports with wire-speed performance. Bridge VLAN filtering
disables hardware offloading (except on CRS3xx series switches), which will prevent packets from being switched, this does not affect Wireless
interfaces as traffic through them cannot be offloaded to the switch chip either way.
```
```
VLAN filtering is not required in this setup, but is highly recommended due to security reasons. Without VLAN filtering it is possible to forward
unknown VLAN IDs in certain scenarios. Disabling VLAN filtering does have performance benefits.

# Wireless Station Modes
```
Overview
802.11 limitations for L2 bridging
Applicability Matrix
Mode station
Mode station-wds
Mode station-pseudobridge
Mode station-pseudobridge-clone
Mode station-bridge
```

## Overview
Wireless interface in any of station modes will search for acceptable access point (AP) and connect to it. The connection between station and AP will
behave in slightly different way depending on type of station mode used, so correct mode must be chosen for given application and equipment. This article
attempts to describe differences between available station modes.
Primary difference between station modes is in how L2 addresses are processed and forwarded across wireless link. This directly affects the ability of
wireless link to be part of L2 bridged infrastructure.
If L2 bridging over wireless link is not necessary - as in case of routed or MPLS switched network, basic mode=station setup is suggested and will provide
highest efficiency.
Availability of particular station mode depends on wireless-protocol that is used in wireless network. Please refer to applicability matrix for information on
mode support in protocols. It is possible that connection between station and AP will be established even if particular mode is not supported for given
protocol. Beware that such connection will not behave as expected with respect to L2 bridging.

## 802.11 limitations for L2 bridging
Historically 802.11 AP devices were supposed to be able to bridge frames between wired network segment and wireless, but station device was not
supposed to do L2 bridging.
Consider the following network:
[X]---[AP]-( )-[STA]---[Y]
where X-to-AP and STA-to-Y are ethernet links, but AP-to-STA are connected wirelessly. According to 802.11, AP can transparently bridge traffic between
X and STA, but it is not possible to bridge traffic between AP and Y, or X and Y.
802.11 standard specifies that frames between station and AP device must be transmitted in so called 3 address frame format, meaning that header of
frame contains 3 MAC addresses. Frame transmitted from AP to station has the following addresses:
```
destination address - address of station device, also radio receiver address
radio transmitter address - address of AP
source address - address of originator of particular frame
```
Frame transmitted from station to AP has the following addresses:
```
radio receiver address - address of AP
source address - address of station device, also radio transmitter address
destination address
```
Considering that every frame must include radio transmitter and receiver address, it is clear that 3 address frame format is not suitable for transparent L2
bridging over station, because station can not send frame with source address different from its address - e.g. frame from Y, and at the same time AP can
not format frame in a way that would include address of Y.
802.11 includes additional frame format, so called 4 address frame format, intended for "wireless distribution system" (WDS) - a system to interconnect
APs wirelessly. In this format additional address is added, producing header that contains the following addresses:
```
radio receiver address
radio transmitter address
destination address
source address
```
This frame format includes all necessary information for transparent L2 bridging over wireless link. Unluckily 802.11 does not specify how WDS
connections should be established and managed, therefore any usage of 4 address frame format (and WDS) is implementation specific.
Different station modes attempt to solve shortcomings of standard station mode to provide support for L2 bridging.
Applicability Matrix
The following matrix specifies station modes available for each wireless-protocol. Note that there are 2 columns for 802.11 protocol: 802.11 specifies
availability of mode in "pure" 802.11 network (when connecting to any vendor AP) and ROS 802.11 specifies availability of mode when connecting to
RouterOS AP that implements necessary proprietary extensions for mode to work.
Table applies to RouterOS v5rc11 and above:
```
802.11 ROS 802.11 nstreme nv2
```
```
station V V V V
```
```
station-wds V V V
```
```
station-pseudobridge V V V
```
```
station-pseudobridge-clone V V V
```
```
station-bridge V V V
```
Mode station
This is standard mode that does not support L2 bridging on station - attempts to put wireless interface in bridge will not produce expected results. On the
other hand this mode can be considered the most efficient and therefore should be used if L2 bridging on station is not necessary - as in case of routed or
MPLS switched network. This mode is supported for all wireless protocols.
Mode station-wds
This mode works only with RouterOS APs. As a result of negotiating connection, separate WDS interface is created on AP for given station. This interface
can be thought of point-to-point connection between AP and given station - whatever is sent out WDS interface is delivered to station (and only to
particular station) and whatever station sends to AP is received from WDS interface (and not subject to forwarding between AP clients), preserving L2
addresses.
This mode is supported for all wireless protocols except when 802.11 protocol is used in connection to non-RouterOS device. Mode uses 4 address frame
format when used with 802.11 protocol, for other protocols (such as nstreme or nv2), protocol internal means are used.
This mode is safe to use for L2 bridging and gives most administrative control on AP by means of separate WDS interface, for example use of bridge
firewall, RSTP for loop detection and avoidance, etc.
With station-wds mode, it is not possible to connect to CAPsMAN controlled CAP.
Mode station-pseudobridge
From the wireless connection point of view, this mode is the same as standard station mode. It has limited support for L2 bridging by means of some
services implemented in station:
```
MAC address translation for IPv4 packets - station maintains IPv4-to-MAC mapping table and replaces source MAC address with its own address
when sending frame to AP (in order to be able to use 3 address frame format), and replaces destination MAC address with address from mapping
table for frames received from AP. IPv4-to-MAC mappings are built also for VLAN encapsulated frames.
single MAC address translation for the rest of protocols - station learns source MAC address from first forwarded non-IPv4 frame and uses it as
default for reverse translation - this MAC address is used to replace destination MAC address for frames received from AP if IPv4-to-MAC
mapping can not be performed (e.g. - non-IPv4 frame or missing mapping).
```
This mode is limited to complete L2 bridging of data to single device connected to station (by means of single MAC address translation) and some support
for IPv4 frame bridging - bridging of non-IP protocols to more than one device will not work. Also MAC address translation limits access to station device
from AP side to IPv4 based access - the rest of protocols will be translated by single MAC address translation and will not be received by station itself.
This mode is available for all protocols except nv2 and should be avoided when possible. The usage of this mode can only be justified if AP does not
support better mode for L2 bridging (e.g. when non-RouterOS AP is used) or if only one end-user device must be connected to network by means of
station device.
Mode station-pseudobridge-clone
This mode is the same as station-pseudobridge mode, except that it connects to AP using "cloned" MAC address - that is either address configured in statio
n-bridge-clone-mac parameter (if configured) or source address of first forwarded frame. This essentially appears on AP as if end-user device connected to
station connected to AP.
Mode station-bridge
This mode works only with RouterOS APs and provides support for transparent protocol-independent L2 bridging on the station device. RouterOS AP
accepts clients in station-bridge mode when enabled using bridge-mode parameter. In this mode, the AP maintains a forwarding table with information on
which MAC addresses are reachable over which station device.
This mode is MikroTik proprietary and cannot be used to connect to other brands of devices.
This mode is safe to use for L2 bridging and is the preferred mode unless there are specific reasons to use station-wds mode. With station-bridge mode, it
is not possible to connect to CAPsMAN controlled CAP.

## Wireless Debug Logs
Debugging wireless problems using Logs.
By default RouterOS wireless log shows that client connects and disconnects as simple entries:
```
22:32:18 wireless,info 00:80:48:41:AF:2A@wlan1: connected
```
It is enough for regular users to know that the wireless client with MAC address "00:80:48:41:AF:2A" is connected to wireless interface "wlan1". But
actually there are more log entries available than are shown in standard logging. They are called 'debug' logs which give more detailed information. In the
following Debug Log example you will see the same client connecting to the AP in more detail than found in typical logging:
```
22:33:20 wireless,debug wlan1: 00:80:48:41:AF:2A attempts to connect
22:33:20 wireless,debug wlan1: 00:80:48:41:AF:2A not in local ACL, by default accept
22:33:20 wireless,info 00:80:48:41:AF:2A@wlan1: connected
```
Debug Logs will give you more specific information on each step of the Client wireless connection and disconnection. The first line shows that the wireless
client tried to connect to the AP. On the second line the AP checked to see if that client is allowed to connect to the AP and the resulting action. And only
on the third line do you see that the client is connected. This is merely one example of the debug log messages. The description of all debug entries is
written below.
To enable the wireless debug logs you should execute such commands:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /system logging
[admin@MikroTik] system logging> add topics=wireless,debug action=memory
```
This will help you understand and fix wireless problems with ease and with less interaction with the support team.

## STATION MODE
<MAC>@<DEV>: lost connection, <REASON>
Station has lost connection to AP because of <REASON>
<MAC>@<DEV>: failed to connect, <REASON>
Station attempted to connect to AP, but failed due to <REASON>
<MAC>@<DEV>: established connection on <FREQ>, SSID <SSID>
Station attempted and succesfully connected to AP with SSID <SSID> on frequency <FREQ>.
<MAC>@<DEV>: MIC failure!!!
TKIP message integrity check failure, somebody must be trying to break into or DOS network, If more than 1 MIC failure is encountered during 60s period,
"TKIP countermeasures" state is entered.
<MAC>@<DEV>: enter TKIP countermeasures
Entered TKIP countermeasures state, this means that Station will disconnect from AP and keep silence for 60s.
AP MODE
<DEV>: radar detected on <FREQ>
Radar detected on frequency <FREQ>, AP will look for other channel
<DEV>: data from unknown device <MAC>, sent deauth [(XXX events suppressed, YYY deauths suppressed)]
Data frame from unknown device (read - not registered to this AP) with mac address <MAC> received, AP sent deauthentication frame to it (as per
802.11). XXX is number of events that are not logged so that the log does not become too large (logs are limited to 1 entry per 5s after first 5 entries), YYY
is the number of deauthentication frames that should have been sent, but were not sent, so that resources are not wasted sending too many
deauthentication frames (only 10 deauth frames per second are allowed).
The likely cause of such a message is that the Station previously connected to the AP, which does not yet know it has been dropped from AP registration
table, sending data to AP. Deauthentication message tells the Station that it is no longer connected.
<DEV>: denying assoc to <MAC>, failed to setup compression
Failed to initialize compression on AP, most likely because there are too many clients attempting to connect and use compression.
<DEV>: <MAC> is new WDS master
WDS slave has established connection to WDS master, this means that WDS slave starts accepting clients and acting as AP.
<DEV>: <MAC> was WDS master
This message appears after connection with <MAC> is lost, means that WDS slave will disconnect all clients and start scanning to find new WDS master.
<MAC>@<DEV>: connected [, is AP][, wants WDS]
Station with address <MAC> connected. if "is AP" present - remote device is AP, if "is WDS" presents, remote device wants to establish WDS link.
<MAC>@<DEV>: disconnected, <REASON>
Connection with Station with address <MAC> terminated due to <REASON>
<DEV>: TKIP countermeasures over, resuming
TKIP countermeasures (60s silence period) over, AP resumes acting as AP.
<DEV>: starting TKIP countermeasures
Entering TKIP countermeasures state (60s silence period), all clients will be lost.
<REASON>
"joining failed" - can only happen on Prism cards in station mode, failed to connect to AP due to some reason
"join timeout" - happens on Station, failed to synchronize to AP (receive first beacon frame). Most likely weak signal, remote turned off, strong interference,
some other RF related issue that makes communication impossible.
"no beacons" - no beacons received from remote end of WDS link. Most likely weak signal, remote turned off, strong interference, some other RF related
issue that makes communication impossible.
"extensive data loss" - local interface decided to drop connection to remote device because of inability to send data to remote after multiple failures at
lowest possible rate. Possible causes - too weak signal, remote device turned off, strong interference, some other RF related issue that makes
communication impossible.
"decided to deauth, <802.11 reason>" - local interface decided do deauthenticate remote device using 802.11 reason <802.11 reason>.
"inactivity" - remote device was inactive for too long
"device disabled" - local interface got disabled
"got deauth, <802.11 reason>" - received deauthentication frame from remote device, 802.11 reason code is reported in <802.11 reason>
"got disassoc, <802.11 reason>" - received disassociation frame from remote device, 802.11 reason code is reported in <802.11 reason>
"auth frame from AP" - authentication frame from remote device that is known to be AP, most likely mode changes on remote device from AP to Station.
"bad ssid" - bad ssid for WDS link
"beacon from non AP" - received beacon frame from remote device that is known to be non-AP node, most likely mode changes on remote device from
Station to AP.
"no WDS support" - does not report WDS support
"failed to confirm SSID" - failed to confirm SSID of other end of WDS link.
"hardware failure" - some hardware failure or unexpected behavior. Not likely to be seen.
"lost connection" - can only happen on Prism cards in station mode, connection to AP lost due to some reason.
"auth failed <802.11 status>" - happens on Station, AP denies authentication, 802.11 status code is reported in <802.11 status>.
"assoc failed <802.11 status>" - happens on Station, AP denies association, 802.11 status code is reported in <802.11 status>.
"auth timeout" - happens on Station, Station does not receive response to authentication frames, either bad link or AP is ignoring this Station for some
reason.
"assoc timeout" - happens on Station, Station does not receive response to association frames, either bad link or AP is ignoring this Station for some
reason.
"reassociating" - happens on AP: connection assumed to be lost, because Station that is considered already associated attempts to associate again. All
connection related information must be deleted, because during association process connection parameters are negotiated (therefore "disconnected"). The
reason why Station reassociates must be looked for on Station (most likely cause is that Station for some reason dropped connection without telling AP - e.
g. data loss, configuration changes).
"compression setup failure" - connection impossible, because not enough resources to do compression (too many stations that want to use compression
already connected)
"control frame timeout" - AP was unable to transmit to the client (similar to error message that you see in the 802.11 protocol - extensive data loss)
<802.11 reason> and <802.11 status>
These are numeric reason/status codes encoded into 802.11 management messages. Log messages include numeric code and textual description from
appropriate standard in 802.11 standards group. Although these are intended to be as descriptive as possible, it must be taken into account that actual
reason/status code that appears in management frames depends solely on equipment or software manufacturer - where one device sends 802.11
management frame including proper reason/status code for situation that caused the frame, other may send frame with "unspecified" reason/status code.
Therefore reason/status code should only be considered informational.
As 802.11 standards evolve, RouterOS may miss textual descriptions for reason/status codes that some devices use. In such case numeric value should
be used to lookup meaning in 802.11 standards.
In order to properly interpret reason/status code, good understanding of 802.11 group standards is necessary. Most of the textual descriptions are self-
explaining. Explanation for some of most commonly seen reson/status codes follows.
class 2 frame received (6) - device received "class 2" frame (association/reassociation management frame) before completing 802.11 authentication
process;
class 3 frame received (7) - device received "class 3" frame (data frame) before completing association process;
Wireless FAQ
Settings
Why I can't connect to MikroTik 802.11n AP with Apple Mac devices?
This problem is only seen on Mac devices based on Broadcom wireless chipsets. In order to connect with such wireless device to MikroTik 802.11n AP
make sure that you don't use 'short' preamble-mode. Use 'long' or 'both' preamble-mode and Mac wireless devices will be able to connect.
By changing some wireless settings the wireless link works unstable
Sometimes when you change some wireless setting for tuning the links you got so far that the link isn't establishing any more or works unstable and you
don't remember what settings you had in the beginning. In this case, you can use the reset-configuration command in the wireless menu - it will reset the
all the wireless settings for the specific wireless interface and you will be able to configure the interface from the start. Note that executing this command
also disables the interface, so please be careful not to execute this command if you are configuring router remotely using that wireless link that you want to
reset the configuration.
What are wireless retransmits and where to check them?
Wireless retransmission occur when an interface sends out a frame and doesn't receive back an acknowledgment (ACK), causing it to try sending the
frame again until an acknowledgment is received or the maximum allowed retransmission count for a packet is reached. Wireless retransmits increase the
latency and lower the throughput of a wireless link. The number of retransmissions taking place can be determined by subtracting the value of the frames
parameter from the value of the 'hw-frames parameter for a given entry in the registration table. Some number of retransmissions is to be expected, but if
the value of frames exceeds the value of frames multiple times, there is an issue with the wireless link that requires troubleshooting.
Can I compare frames with hw-frames also on Nstreme links?
The frames counts only those which contain actual data. In the case of Nstreme, only the ACK can be transmitted in a single frame, if there is no other
data to send. These ACK frames will not be added to the frames count, but they will appear at hw-frames. If there is traffic on both directions at maximum
speed (eg. there will be no only-ack frames), then you can't compare frames to hw-frames as in case of regular wireless links.
What TX-power values can I use?
The tx-power default setting is the maximum tx-power that the card can use and is taken from the cards eeprom. If you want to use larger tx-power values,
you are able to set them, but do it at your own risk, as it will probably damage your card eventually! Usually, one should use this parameter only to reduce
the tx-power.
In general, tx-power controlling properties should be left at the default settings. Changing the default setting may help with some cards in some situations,
but without testing, the most common result is the degradation of range and throughput. Some of the problems that may occur are:
```
overheating of the power amplifier chip and the card which will cause lower efficiency and more data errors;
overdriving the amplifier which will cause more data errors;
excessive power usage for the card and this may overload the 3.3V power supply of the board that the card is located on resulting in voltage drop
and reboot or excessive temperatures for the board.
```
What TX-power-mode is the best?
TX-power-mode tells the wireless card which tx-power values should be used. By default, this setting is set to default.
```
default means that the card will use the tx-power values from the cards eeprom and will ignore the setting what is specified by the user in the tx-
power field.
card-rates means that for different data rates the tx-power is calculated according to the cards transmit power algorithm from the cards eeprom
and as an argument it takes tx-power value specified by the user.
all-rates-fixed means that that the card will use one tx-power value for all data rates which is specified by the user in tx-power field.
```
Note that it is not recommended to use 'all-rates-fixed' mode as the wireless card tx-power for the higher data rates is lower and by forcing to use the fixed
tx-power rates also for the higher data rates might result in the same problems like in the previous question about tx-power setting. In the case of MikroTik
Radio devices, the power will not be higher than the power written in the EEPROM. For most of the cases if you want to change the tx-power settings it is
recommended to use the tx-power-mode=card-rates and it is recommended to lower and not to raise tx-power. In case of AR9300 and newer Atheros
wireless chipsets "tx-power-mode=all-rate-fixed" is the only option as "card-rates" option isn't working on those chipsets.
What is CCQ and how are the values determined?
Client Connection Quality (CCQ) is a value in percent that shows how effective the bandwidth is used regarding the theoretically maximum available
bandwidth. CCQ is weighted average of values Tmin/Treal, that get calculated for every transmitted frame, where Tmin is time it would take to transmit
given frame at highest rate with no retries and Treal is time it took to transmit frame in real life (taking into account necessary retries it took to transmit
frame and transmit rate).
What is hw-retries setting?
Number of times sending frame is retried without considering it a transmission failure. The data rate is decreased upon failure and frame is sent again.
Three sequential failures on lowest supported rate suspend transmission to this destination for the duration of on-fail-retry-time. After that, the frame is sent
again. The frame is being retransmitted until transmission success, or until the client is disconnected after disconnect-timeout. The frame can be discarded
during this time if frame-lifetime is exceeded. In case of Nstreme "on-fail-retry-time", "disconnect-timeout" and "frame-lifetime" settings are not used. So
after three sequential failures on the lowest supported rate, the wireless link is disconnected with "extensive data loss" message.
What is disconnect-timeout setting?
This interval is measured from the third sending failure on the lowest data rate. At this point 3 * (hw-retries + 1) frame transmits on the lowest data rate had
failed. During disconnect-timeout packet transmission will be retried with on-fail-retry-time interval. If no frame can be transmitted successfully during discon
nect-timeout, the connection is closed, and this event is logged as "extensive data loss". Successful frame transmission resets this timer.
What is adaptive-noise-immunity setting?
Adaptive Noise Immunity (ANI) adjusts various receiver parameters dynamically to minimize interference and noise effect on the signal quality. This setting
is added in the wireless driver for Atheros AR5212 and newer chipset cards
How does wireless device measure signal strength, when access-list or connect-list are used ?
The reported signal level is exponentially weighted moving average with a smoothing factor of 50%.
What error correction methods are supported in the RouterOS wireless?
ARQ method is supported in nstreme protocols. Regular 802.11 standard does not include ARQ - retransmission of corrupt frames is based on
acknowledgment protocol. RouterOS supports forward error correction coding (convolutional coding) with coding rates: 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4.
Configuring RouterOS device for 160MHz use
If the RouterOS device supports 4x4 transmission, additionally to setting 160MHz channel width, make sure to set "rate-set=default" on the wireless
interface so all streams are available
If the client does not support Extended NSS and can only perform 2x2 transmission, set "vht-supported-mcs=mcs0-9,mcs0-9,none"
Setups
Will an amplifier improve the speed on my link?
It depends on your signal quality and noise. Remember that you can probably get a better link with low output power setting, and a good antenna. An
amplifier increases the noise and will only cause problems with the link.
The amplifier gets a boost on both the transmitted and received signal. Thus, in "silent" areas, where you are alone or with very few "noise" or
"competition", you might get excellent results. On the other side, in crowded areas, with lots of wireless activity, you will also increase signal received from
every other competitor or noise source, which may dramatically lower the overall quality of the link. Also, take in account the EIRP to see if your link
remains in legal limits.
You could also get a better signal on "11b only" radios, which see most of 802.11g as "noise", thus filtering better the usable signal.
How to fine-tune the wireless link with hw-retries?
You should understand that for 802.11 devices there is a really limited amount of information (or "feedback" from the environment) that devices can use to
tune their behavior:
```
signal strength, which could be used to figure out best transmit rate knowing receiver sensitivity. Sill this is not reliable taking into account that
sensitivity for different receivers varies (e.g. changes over time), path conditions are not symmetric (and device can only measure signal strength
it receives), etc.
by receiving/not receiving acknowledgment for frame sent.
```
Taking into account that using signal strength is not reliable, 802.11 devices are essentially left with only one "feedback" to tune its operation - success
/failure of transmission. When transmission fails (ACK not received in time), there is no way how sender can figure out why it failed - either because of
noise, multipath, direct interference (and whether that disturbed actual data frame or the ACK itself) - frame just did not make it and in general it does not
matter "why". All that matters is the packet error rate.
Therefore RouterOS implements an algorithm to try to use medium most efficiently in any environment by using only this limited information, giving users
the ability to control how the algorithm works and describing the algorithm. And there are only a few usage guidelines, not a set of values you should use in
a particular situation.
In general - the larger hw-retries, the better "feedback" device gets about medium ability to deliver frame at particular rate (e.g. if sending frame with rate
54mbps fails 16 times, it is telling you more than if it fails with 2 retries) and the better it can figure out optimal transmit rate, at the expense of latency it can
introduce in network - because during all those failing retries, other devices in this channel cannot send. So bigger hw-retries can be suggested for ptp
backbone links - where it is known that link must be always on. Less hw-retries make rate selection adapt faster at the expense of some accuracy (going
below 2 is not reasonable in most cases), this can be suggested for ptmp links, where it is normal for links to connect/disconnect and keeping latency down
is important.
on-fail-retry-time and disconnect-timeout controls how hard device will try to consider remote party "connected". Larger disconnect-timeout will make the
device not "disconnect" other party, even if there are lots of loss at the smallest possible transmission rate. This again is most useful for "weak" links that
are known that they "must" be established (e.g. backbone links). In ptmp networks large disconnect-timeout will again increase latency in the network
during the time e.g. AP will attempt to send data to some client that has just been disabled (AP will try to do this for the whole disconnect-timeout).
frame-lifetime allows to tune for how long AP is attempting to use frame for transmitting before considering that it is not worth delivering it (for example, if
sending frame fails at lowest possible rate, on-fail-retry-time timer is enabled, if during this timer frame-lifetime expires, particular frame is dropped and the
next transmission attempt will happen with the next frame. Disabled frame-lifetime means that wireless will ensure in order delivery of "all" data frames, no
matter how long it takes, "or" will drop the connection if everything fails). This allows optimizing for different types of traffic e.g. for real-time traffic - if the
primary use of the wireless network is e.g. voip, then it can be reasonable to limit frame-lifetime, because voip tolerates small loss better than high latency.
Is it possible to use the wireless repeater only with one radio interface?
This setup it possible by using WDS on the wireless interface which is running in ap-bridge mode. And in newer RouterOS versions it is possible to
configure wireless repeater mode.
Nv2 wireless link disconnects very often
When Nv2 wireless link experiences disconnections and in log section most of the messages are 'control frame timeout', you can try to lower the transmit
output power of the wireless cards if the signal of the link is strong. We suggest using tx-power-mode=card-rates for lowering the tx-power of the wireless
card. If the problem continues to try to use a different wireless frequency that might have less interference. If that also didn't help, please contact support@
mikrotik.com with a support output file from the affected AP and the Station which are made after those disconnections.

Using CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode

Case studies
Without Virtual APs
```

## Summary
It is possible to create a centralized Access Point management setup for a home or office environment that is scalable to many Access Points, such a
setup is quite easy to configure and has been explained in the Simple CAPsMAN setup guide, but for more complex setups VLANs might be required.
CAPsMAN has the functionality to assign a certain VLAN ID under certain conditions. This guide will provide an example on how to assign a VLAN ID to
Wireless packets based on the AP, to which a wireless client connects to. CAPsMAN with VLANs can be achieved either by using Local Forwarding Mode
or CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode, the Local Forwarding Mode will provide the possibility to use a switch between your APs and CAPsMAN router to switch
packets (to achieve larger throughput), while CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode should be used when all traffic should always be forwarded to the CAPsMAN
router (in most cases to filter packets).
In this example, we are going to assign all our Wireless clients to VLAN10, if they connect to WiFi_WORK, and going to assign Wireless clients to VLAN20,
if they connect to WiFi_GUEST. We are going to use Virtual APs along with CAPsMAN to create multiple SSIDs for our Wireless clients to connect to while
using a single physical device. An example of how to use a single SSID for a single physical device will also be shown by using CAPsMAN provisioning
rules.

## Using Local Forwarding Mode
In Local Forwarding Mode, the CAPsMAN router is distributing the configuration across all CAPs that are being provisioned by the CAPsMAN router. In
Local Forwarding Mode traffic is not required to be sent to the CAPsMAN router, rather it can be sent to a different router without involving the CAPsMAN
router when forwarding traffic. This mode allows you to tag traffic to a certain VLAN ID before it is sent to your network from your Wireless client, which
adds the possibility to use a switch to limit certain VLAN IDs to certain ports. In Local Forwarding Mode traffic is not encapsulated with a special CAPsMAN
header, which can only be removed by a CAPsMAN router.
CAPsMAN Router:
```
Create appropriate CAP configurations for each VLAN
```
```
/caps-man configuration
add country=latvia datapath.local-forwarding=yes datapath.vlan-id=10 datapath.vlan-mode=use-tag
name=Config_WORK security.authentication-types=wpa-psk,wpa2-psk \
security.passphrase=secret_work_password ssid=WiFi_WORK
add country=latvia datapath.local-forwarding=yes datapath.vlan-id=20 datapath.vlan-mode=use-tag
name=Config_GUEST security.authentication-types=\
wpa-psk,wpa2-psk security.passphrase=secret_guest_password ssid=WiFi_GUEST
```
```
We are going to create a single CAPsMAN provisioning rule to create the WiFi_WORK and the WiFi_GUEST SSIDs on a single device, each
connected CAP is going to create these SSIDs automatically
```
```
/caps-man provisioning
add action=create-dynamic-enabled master-configuration=Config_WORK slave-configurations=Config_GUEST
```
```
For security reasons, limit the CAPsMAN to a single interface
```

Switch:
In this example, we are going to be using Bridge VLAN Filtering to filter unknown VLANs and to assign other devices to the same networks. Some devices
are capable of offloading this to the built-in switch chip, check Basic VLAN switching guide to see how to configure it on different types of devices.
```
Setup Bridge VLAN Filtering
```
```
You can create even more Virtual APs by adding multiple slave-configurations. That requires multiple CAPsMAN configurations that were
created earlier.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5 pvid=20
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2,ether3 untagged=ether4 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether1,ether2,ether3 untagged=ether5 vlan-ids=20
```
CAPs:
```
Create a bridge and assign a port to it, that is connected to the CAPsMAN Router
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
```
```
Enable CAP mode on the AP, and make sure you specify to use the newly created bridge
```
```
/interface wireless cap
set bridge=bridge1 discovery-interfaces=bridge1 enabled=yes interfaces=wlan1
```
```
After CAPs are successfully connected to the CAPsMAN Router, the wlan1 (SSID WiFi_WORK) and a newly created virtual wlan5 (SSID WiFi_GU
EST) interfaces get dynamically added as bridge ports. The VLAN is assigned for a wireless interface and as a result, all data coming from
wireless gets tagged and only data with this tag will be sent out over wireless. A bridge vlan-filtering can be disabled if additional VLAN managing
and controlling is not needed. The associated VLAN can be seen with a port VLAN ID (PVID) property.
```
```
[admin@CAP_1] /interface bridge port pr

1 D wlan1 bridge1 10 0x80 10

2 D wlan5 bridge1 20 0x80 10
10 none
```
That is it! Connect Wireless clients to your APs and check connectivity.
Using CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode
```
In this example, untagged traffic is going to be used to communicate between CAPs and CAPsMAN Router. By default, if PVID is not changed,
untagged traffic is going to be forwarded between ports that have the same PVID value set (including the default PVID).
```
In CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode all traffic that is coming from a CAP is encapsulated with a special CAPsMAN header, which can only be removed by a
CAPsMAN router, this means that a switch will not be able to distinguish the VLAN ID set by the CAP since the VLAN tag is also going to be encapsulated.
This mode limits the possibility to divert traffic in Layer2 networks, but gives you the possibility to forward traffic from each CAP over Layer3 networks for a
distant CAPsMAN router to process the traffic, this mode is useful when you want to control multiple CAPs in remote locations, but want to use a central
gateway.
CAPsMAN router:
```
Setup Bridge VLAN filtering to limit interfaces to appropriate VLANs
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 pvid=10
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2 pvid=20
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=10
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20
```
Note: CAPsMAN will attach CAP interfaces to the bridge and automatically will add appropriate entries to the bridge VLAN table. This feature is available
starting with RouterOS v6.43
```
Create appropriate CAP configurations for each VLAN
```
```
CAPsMAN will attach CAP interfaces to the bridge and automatically will add appropriate entries to the bridge VLAN table

security.authentication-types=wpa-psk,wpa2-psk \
security.passphrase=secret_guest_password ssid=WiFi_GUEST
```
```
We are going to create a single CAPsMAN provisioning rule to create the WiFi_WORK and the WiFi_GUEST SSIDs on a single device, each
connect CAP is going to create these SSIDs automatically
```
```
/caps-man provisioning
add action=create-dynamic-enabled master-configuration=Config_WORK slave-configurations=Config_GUEST
```
```
For security reasons, limit the CAPsMAN to interfaces. to which CAPs are going to be connected
```
```
/caps-man manager interface
set [ find default=yes ] forbid=yes
add disabled=no interface=ether3
add disabled=no interface=ether4
```
```
Enable the CAPsMAN manager
```
```
/caps-man manager
set enabled=yes
```
```
Setup DHCP Server for each VLAN
```
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN10 vlan-id=10
add interface=bridge1 name=VLAN20 vlan-id=20
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=VLAN10

add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.20.1
```
CAPs:
```
Enable CAP mode on each AP, specify which interface is connected to the CAPsMAN router
```
```
/interface wireless cap
set discovery-interfaces=ether1 enabled=yes interfaces=wlan1
```
```
After CAPs are successfully connected to the CAPsMAN Router, two CAP interfaces will be dynamically created on the CAPsMAN Router. Both
of these interfaces will get dynamically added as bridge ports on the same CAPsMAN Router due to explicitly selecting the bridge interface with da
tapath.bridge=bridge1 and using the default CAPsMAN Forwarding Mode datapath.local-forwarding=no. Because of using a bridge with enabled vl
an-filtering, both CAP interfaces will also show up in a bridge VLAN table.
```
```
You can create even more Virtual APs by adding multiple slave-configurations. That requires multiple CAPsMAN configurations that were
created earlier.
```
```

That is it! Connect Wireless clients to your APs and check connectivity.
Case studies
Without Virtual APs
Not everyone wants to create Virtual APs since that does decrease the total throughput. If you want to use multiple devices to create multiple SSIDs, then
it is possible to assign a certain configuration on a CAP based on its identity. To achieve this you should use CAPsMAN provisioning rules along with
RegEx expressions. In this example we are going to assign the Config_WORK configuration to CAPs that have identity set to "'AP_WORK_*" and we are
going to assign the Config_GUEST configuration to CAPs that have identity set to "AP_GUEST_*". To do this, you simply need to change the CAPsMAN
provisioning rules.
```
Remove any existing provisioning rules
```
```
/caps-man provisioning remove [f]
```
```
Create new provisioning rules that will assign appropriate configuration on a CAP based on its identity
```
```
/caps-man provisioning
add action=create-dynamic-enabled identity-regexp=^AP_GUEST_ master-configuration=Config_GUEST
add action=create-dynamic-enabled identity-regexp=^AP_WORK_ master-configuration=Config_WORK
```
```
Don't forget to set a proper identity on the CAPs since CAPsMAN is going to assign appropriate configuration on the APs based on it's identity.

## SA query timeout
In short - this means that the client left the router range, AP sent an information request in order to check, if the client is still present and did not receive an
answer. Thus - the client has left the range. Completely normal debug log message - this is not an error or warning. Just an informational message.
In greater detail:
SA Query Timeout is a normal part of wireless behavior. It is a security feature.
SA Query is triggered in the following scenario:
1) On AP there is a valid security association for the station
2) AP receives an Association request from an already associated station
3) AP responds with Association request rejected - "Association Comeback interval" Status Code:30.  - this is done in order for AP to understand if the
association request came from an attacker, or if it came from a station that got out of range, and was not able to disassociate beforehand.
4) AP sends SA Query Request to the station. Using original encryption that was used with the client beforehand. If the client sends SA Query Response, it
will mean that the initial association request came from Attacker.
5) If the Client doesn't give SA Query response, it means that the real client got disconnected, or rather was out of range, and didn't disassociate from AP
properly, and restarted association to AP - no attacker is present in this case. And at this point, you will see SA Query Timeout in the log.
Unless you see excessive amounts of this message in the log, it is not a problem, and even if you do, it does not necessarily mean that there is a bug in
RouterOS, it can appear due to external factors as well.


# Spectral scan
```
Introduction
Console
Spectral History
Spectral Scan
The Dude
```

## Introduction
The spectral scan can scan all frequencies supported by your wireless card, and plot them directly in the console. The exact frequency span depends on
the card. Allowed ranges on r52n: [4790; 6085], [2182; 2549].
A wireless card can generate 4us long spectral snapshots for any 20mhz wide channel. This is considered a single spectral sample.
To improve data quality spectrum is scanned with 10mhz frequency increments, which means doubled sample coverage at each specific frequency
(considering 20mhz wide samples).

## Console

## Spectral History
```
/interface wireless spectral-history <wireless interface name>
```
Plots spectrogram. Legend and frequency ruler is printed every 24 lines. Numbers in the ruler correspond to the value at their leftmost character position.
Power values that fall in different ranges are printed as different colored characters with the same foreground and background color, so it is possible to
copy and paste the terminal output of this command.
```
value -- select value that is plotted on the output. 'interference' is special as it shows detected interference sources (affected by the 'classify-
samples' parameter) instead of power readings, and cannot be made audible;
interval -- interval at which spectrogram lines are printed;
duration -- terminate command after a specified time. default is indefinite;
buckets -- how many values to show in each line of a spectrogram. This value is limited by the number of columns in the terminal. It is useful to
reduce this value if using 'audible';
average-samples -- Number of 4us spectral snapshots to take at each frequency, and calculate average and maximum energy over them. (default
10);
```
```
Currently, is NOT supported for Atheros 802.11ac chips (e.g. QCA98xx, IPQ-4018). See https://mikrotik.com/products determine the wireless
chip on your device.
```
```
classify-samples -- Number of spectral snapshots taken at each frequency and processed by the interference classification algorithm. Generally,
more samples give more chance to spot certain types of interference (default 50);
range --
2.4ghz - scan the whole 2.4ghz band;
5ghz - scan the whole 5ghz band;
current-channel - scan current channel only (20 or 40 MHz wide);
range - scan specific range;
```
```
audible=yes -- play each line as it is printed. There is a short silence between the lines. Each line is played from left to right, with higher
frequencies corresponding to higher values in the spectrogram.
```
Spectral Scan
```
/interface wireless spectral-scan <wireless interface name>
```
Continuously monitor spectral data. This command uses the same data source as 'spectral-history', and thus shares many parameters.
Each line displays one spectrogram bucket -- frequency, the numeric value of power average, and a character graphic bar. A bar shows average power
value with ':' characters and average peak hold with '.' characters. Maximum is displayed as a lone floating ':' character.
```
show-interference -- add a column that shows detected interference sources;
```
Types of possibly classified interference:
```
Bluetooth-headset
Bluetooth-stereo
cordless-phone
microwave-oven
```

### CWA

video-bridge
wifi

## Summary
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows broadcasting the data over specific Bluetooth channels.
There are 40 unique bands (channels) and each band has a 2 MHz separation. 37, 38, and 39 channels are used for primary advertising, and 0-36 are
used for data transmission.
During the advertising process, the BLE advertising packet is broadcasted. This packet contains the Preamble, Access Address, PDU and CRS fields.
The Preamble and Access Address fields help the receiver detect frames. CRS field is used to check errors. PDU consists of PDU Header and PDU
Payload. PDU defines the packet itself.
PDU Header contains information about the PDU type. Based on the type, the payload fields may differ.
For example, when PDU type is ADV_NONCONN_IND → PDU Payload consists of "AdvA" (a field that contains information about the advertiser's address)
and "AdvData" (a field that contains data information) fields:
1 octet = 1 byte = 8 bits
```
Preamble 1 octet
```
```
Access-Address 4 octets
```
```
PDU
PDU Header = 2 octets
PDU Payload = AdvA (6 octets)+AdvData (0...31 octets)
```
```
CRS 3 octets
```
There are different PDU types:
```
ADV_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for connectable, scannable undirected
advertising);
ADV_NOCONN_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for non-connectable, non-scannable
undirected advertising);
ADV_SCAN_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + AdvData [0-31 octets] and which is used for scannable, undirected advertising);
SCAN_REQ (where payload consists of ScanA [6octets] + AdvA [6octets], where ScanA field contains scanner's address and AdvA contains
advertiser's address, and which is used for requesting SCAN_RSP response);
SCAN_RSP (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + ScanRspData [0-31 octets], where ScanRspData can contain any data from the
advertiser's host and which is used to respond to a SCAN_REQ request);
ADV_DIRECT_IND (where payload consists of AdvA [6octets] + TargetA [6octets], where TargetA is the device address field to which the PDU is
addressed, and which is used for connectable, directed advertising);
etc
```
You can find more information about the packet structure over here (Bluetooth specifications).
The main application for the Bluetooth interface in RouterOS is to monitor Bluetooth advertising packets (scanner feature) that are broadcasted by other
devices (like for example, Bluetooth tags) or broadcast advertising packets (advertiser feature).
Configuration
Sub-menu: /iot bluetooth
note: iot package is required.
note: Check your device's specifications page to make sure that the Bluetooth is supported by the unit.
IoT package is available with RouterOS version 6.48.3. You can get it from our download page - under "Extra packages".
Devices
In this menu you can check and set general Bluetooth chip parameters:
```

```
```
max-interval (integer:20..10240; Default: 2560
ms)
```
```
The maximal interval for broadcasting advertising packets.
```
```
min-interval (integer:20..10240; Default: 1280 ms) The minimal interval for broadcasting advertising packets.
```
```
own-address-type (public | random-static | rpa-
fallback-to-public | rpa-fallback-to-random;
Default: random-static)
```
```
The MAC address that is going to be used in the advertising packet's payload:
```
```
public →  To use the IEEE registered, permanent address.
random-static →  To use user-configurable address (will be changed on the next power-cycle).
rpa-fallback-to-public → To use Resolvable Random Private Address (RPA) that can only be
resolved if the receiver has our Identity Resolving Key (IRK). If RPA can not be generated, the
public address will be used instead.
rpa-fallback-to-random → Same as "rpa-fallback-to-public" but if RPA can not be generated, the
random-static address will be used instead.
```
note: Advertising packets will be broadcasted each min-interval <= X <= max-interval milliseconds.
AD structures
This section allows you to define the payload for the advertising packets that are going to be broadcasted by the Bluetooth chip.
Currently, only 4 types are supported: 0x08 "Shortened Local Name"; 0x09 "Complete Local Name"; 0xFF "Manufacturer Specific Data"; "Service Data"
You can check and set "AD structures" settings with the commands:
```
/iot bluetooth advertisers ad-structures print
Columns: NAME, TYPE, DATA
# NAME TYPE DATA
0 test short-local-name TEST
/iot bluetooth advertisers ad-structures set
```
Configurable properties are shown below:
```
Property Description
```
```
data (string; Default: ) Define advertising packet's AdvData part of the payload
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of AD structure
```
```
type (complete-local-name | manufacturer-data | short-local-name | service-data; Default: ) An option to set AD structure's type:
```
```
0x08 "Shortened Local Name"
0x09 "Complete Local Name"
0xFF "Manufacturer Specific Data"
0x20 "Service Data 32-bit"
```
If, for example, the "Shortened Local Name" type is chosen and the "data" field is configured with "TEST" → AdvData part of the payload is going to look
like this:
05 08 54 45 53 54 (hexadecimal format)
, where the first octet (05) shows the number of bytes to follow (5 bytes) and the second octet (08) shows the type (Shortened Local Name). 3d, 4th, 5th
and 6th (and etc) octets are the "data" [54 (hex)=T (ASCII), 45 (hex)=E (ASCII), 53 (hex)=S (ASCII), 54 (hex)=T (ASCII)].
The same applies to the "Complete Local Name" type. Only the second octet in the AdvData payload is going to differ and will be set to 09.
For the "Manufacturer Specific Data" type, you will need to configure the "data" field in the hexadecimal format. The second octet for this type is going to
be set to FF.
Connections
Currenetly, only "central" role is supported. "Pheriperal device" role, "pairing" and "encryption" options are not supported.
Availible sections are:
```
Section Description
```
```
async-data used to view subscribed data.

```
Scanners
In this menu, you can set up the scanner settings for the Bluetooth chip. When disabled, the device is no longer able to receive advertising reports. When
enabled, you can monitor advertising reports in the "Advertising reports" tab (which will be explained later in the guide). You can check and set scanner
settings with the commands:
```
Availible starting with v7.12beta9.
```
```
To connect to TG-BT5-IN/OUT tags, make sure to put it into the connactable state by applying a magnet to the magnetic switch.

```
An option to discard duplicate advertisements from the same advertiser:
```
```
keep-newest → Keeps the newest report (discards the oldest). Only the newest PDU from a single AdvA will be
kept.
keep-oldest → Keeps the oldest report (discards the newest). Only the oldest PDU from a single AdvA will be
kept. This type of PDU filtering happens at the controller level and as such it's the most efficient (energy
/bandwidth-wise) method of duplicate filtering.
keep-unique → Only displays advertisements that have a unique payload. Meaning, if 1+ identical payloads
(AdvData) are found, only the first payload is going to be displayed, while the "clones" are discarded/ignored.
off → Duplicates are not discarded. All PDUs with the same AdvA will be kept.
```
```
filter-policy (default | whitelist |
no; Default: default)
```
```
An option to set up a filtering policy (controller-level advertisement filtering):
```
```
default → When this policy is enabled, the scanner will only accept ADV_IND, ADV_NOCONN_IND,
ADV_SCAN_IND, SCAN_RSP, and ADV_DIRECT_IND (where TargetA is the scanner's own Bluetooth address)
PDU types.
whitelist → When this policy is enabled, the scanner will only accept ADV_IND, ADV_NOCONN_IND,
ADV_SCAN_IND, SCAN_RSP PDU types that are broadcasted by the advertiser, whose address is configured
in the "Whitelist" section, and ADV_DIRECT_IND type PDU (where TargetA is the scanner's own Bluetooth
address).

Identity Resolving Key (IRK). If RPA can not be generated, the public address will be used instead.
rpa-fallback-to-random → Same as "rpa-fallback-to-public" but if RPA can not be generated, the random-static
address will be used instead.

```
A duplicate advertising report is an advertising report sent from the same device address. The actual data
("AdvData" part of the payload) may change/differ and it is not considered significant when determining du
plicate advertising reports. Meaning that, for example, if the Bluetooth interface receives 10 payloads
(payload after payload with a 1-second interval) from the same tag:
```
```
if you are using the "keep-oldest" setting → Bluetooth interface will only display the first payload
received (9 follow-up payloads will be filtered out) from that tag.
if you are using the "keep-newest" setting → Bluetooth interface will only display the last payload
received (each follow-up payload will rewrite the previous one) from that tag.
```
```
type (active | passive; Default: p
assive)
```
```
Defines the scanner's type:
```
```
active → Scanner can send scan requests if it receives a scannable advertisement. The scanner can send a
SCAN_REQ in order to acquire a SCAN_RSP response.
passive → Scanner will only listen for advertisements, no data (e.g. scan requests) will be sent.
```
```
window (integer:3..10240; Defau
lt: 10 ms)
```
```
The time that the scanner will spend scanning a single advertisement channel.
```
For example, if the scanner interval is set to 20ms, it means that only after 20ms, the device will begin scanning the next channel in line. If the scanner
window is set to 10ms, it means that the device will scan each channel only during that 10ms window. Meaning, it will scan channel 37 for 10ms (window
time) and begin scanning the next channel after 10 more ms (20ms[interval]-10ms[window]). It will take 10ms to scan channel 38, and after 10 more ms,
the device will begin scanning channel 39.
Advertising reports
In this section, it is possible to monitor Bluetooth advertising reports (from the nearby broadcasters). The list is limited to 1024 entries (if the list gets full
with 1024 entries, each new payload received will overwrite the "oldest" one). You can monitor advertising reports with the command:
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print
Columns: DEVICE, PDU-TYPE, TIME, ADDRESS-TYPE, ADDRESS, RSSI
# DEV PDU-TYPE TIME ADDRES ADDRESS RSSI
0 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:30:56 public 2C:C8:1B:93:16:49 -24dBm
1 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:30:56 random 0B:16:17:9E:7B:EF -60dBm
```
It is possible to set up a filter for the reports with the command:
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where
```
For example, to print reports that are broadcasted by a specific Bluetooth address, use the command:
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where address=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
# DEVICE PDU-TYPE TIME ADD... ADDRESS RSSI LENGTH DATA
79 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:38 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -70dBm 30 02010...
80 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:43 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -67dBm 30 02010...
81 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:44 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -70dBm 28 1bff0...
82 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/28/2021 09:46:48 public XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -75dBm 30 02010...
```
To show only advertising reports that have RSSI stronger than -30 dBm, use the command:
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print where rssi > -30
# DEVICE PDU-TYPE TIME ADDRESS-TYPE ADDRESS RSSI LENGTH
DATA
307 bt1 adv-noconn-ind jul/29/2021 10:11:31 public 2C:C8:1B:93:16:49 -24dBm 22

```
Possible filters (you can filter the list of advertising reports with the help of the following parameters):
```
Filter Description
```
```
address Bluetooth advertisers address
```
```
address-type Advertisers address type (for example, public or random)
```
```

```
Whitelist
In this tab, it is possible to configure a whitelist that is going to be used in the filter policy in the "Scanners" section. In other words, an option to specify
which Bluetooth addresses are going to be scanned (displayed in the "Advertising reports").
You can view the whitelisted entries with the command:
```
/iot bluetooth whitelist print
Columns: DEVICE, ADDRESS-TYPE, ADDRESS
# DEVICE ADDRESS-TYPE ADDRESS
0 bt1 any *:*:*:*:*:*
```
You can add a new whitelist entry with the command:
```
/iot bluetooth whitelist add
```
Configurable properties:
```
Property Description
```
```
address (MAC address; Default: ) Advertiser's address
```
```
address-type (any | public | random; Default: ) Advertiser's address type
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the whitelisted entry
```
```
copy-from An option to copy an entry - for more information check the console documentation
```
```
device (bt1; Default: ) Select the Bluetooth interface/chip name
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: ) An option to disable or to enable the entry
```
If, for example, you want to whitelist all MAC addresses that begin with "DC:2C:..." octets, add an entry using wildcard asterisk characters:
```
/iot bluetooth whitelist add address=DC:2C:*:*:*:*
```
Wildcard asterisk can not be used in-between specific octets, like "AA:*:*:BB:*:*" (it is an invaldi entry).
Valid entries would be:
```
AA:BB:CC:DD:*:*
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:*
AA:*:*:*:*:*
```
```
Only 8 whitelisted entries can be added prior to 7.14beta8 version.
Starting with 7.14beta8 version, whitelist is no longer limited to 8 entries and address field supports asterisk wildcards.
```

```
Additionally, you have the option to set "persist=yes", which will make sure that the device/tag stays on the list forever (because devices that stop
broadcasting payloads will be timed-out after one minute and removed from the list until new payloads start appearing in the air):
```
/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices set persist=yes address="DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E"
```
You can also set a name for the device, so you can easier find it on the list, with the command:
```
/iot bluetooth peripheral-devices set name="my_tag" address="DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3E"
```
Decode-ad
In this menu, you can decode static MikroTik, Eddystone TLM, Eddystone UID and iBeacon payloads.
To decode a payload, just input it into the "data" field:

## Introduction
Bluetooth interface implementation in RouterOS allows the device to capture Bluetooth advertising packets that are broadcasted over 37, 38, and 39
advertising channels. More information can be found in the guide here.
Bluetooth tags like, for example, TG-BT5-IN and TG-BT5-OUT, do exactly that. They broadcast advertising payloads over the mentioned channels. To
understand what kind of information is stored in the payload, make sure to check the link. The tags can be configured (using the MikroTik Beacon Manager
app) to broadcast the payloads automatically, with an interval or/and when a movement, tilt, or free-fall trigger is detected. In simple terms, the tag will "tell"
(broadcast to) all the surrounding Bluetooth scanners (like the KNOT) information about itself periodically.
When the payload is broadcasted by the tag, and the tag is within the KNOT's Bluetooth operating range, the KNOT will capture and display the payload
under its "scanner" Bluetooth interface section. It would look like this:
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print
Columns: DEVICE, PDU-TYPE, TIME, ADDRESS-TYPE, ADDRESS, RSSI, LENGTH, DATA
# DEVICE PDU-TYPE TIME ADDRESS-TYPE ADDRESS RSSI LENGTH
DATA
0 bt1 adv-noconn-ind mar/07/2023 12:11:57 public DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D -51dBm 22
15ff4f09010079100000ffff0000cf188a6b2b000064
1 bt1 adv-noconn-ind mar/07/2023 12:11:58 public 2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A -49dBm 22
15ff4f090100168dfefffffffeffa51ae1362200005e
```
The example above shows us, that the KNOT sees two Bluetooth tags within its operating range with MAC addresses "DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D" and "2C:C8:
1B:4B:BB:0A", their respective payloads ("DATA" field) and the signal strength ("RSSI" field).
With the help of RouterOS scripting and scheduling, we can make the KNOT automatically-periodically scan the payload list and, in case, a specific
payload or a specific tag's MAC address is found on the list, we can make the KNOT structure an MQTT message (out of the printed information shown in
the example above) and send it to the configured server via MQTT, e-mail or HTTP post. Script examples will be shown later on in the guide.
As the title suggests, the goal is to implement a Bluetooth tag-tracking solution and the idea is quite simple. When you have 2 KNOTs (KNOT-A and KNOT-
B), running the same script on a scheduler, and the tag moves between their Bluetooth operating ranges, the data on the server will indicate whether it was
KNOT-A or KNOT-B that have sent the tag's payload. That will help you figure out the proximity of the tag. Whether the tag is broadcasting payloads in the
KNOT-A zone, or in the KNOT-B zone.
You will need a server where the data is going to be stored and visualized. In this guide, we will showcase a server called ThingsBoard and how to
communicate with it using the MQTT protocol.
ThingsBoard has a cloud solution and different local installation options (on different OS). Since we've added a container feature, it became possible to
also run the platform within RouterOS. In order to do that, you will need a RouterOS device that has at least 2 GB RAM to spare or 1 GB RAM to spare
with minimal load, has the option to increase storage (for example, an additional USB port), and is either ARM64 or AMD64 architecture. Consider using C
HR machine, as it could be a good fit.
Setup requirements:
```
a running ThingsBoard server;
2+ KNOTs with access to the server's network via ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection (the amount of the units required depends on the size of
the area that needs to be covered);
1+ Bluetooth TG-BT5-IN and/or TG-BT5-OUT tags (depending on how many assets you need to track - 1 tag per asset).
```
Scenario explanation
Let's take a look at a basic example first. We have two KNOTs (KNOT-A and KNOT-B). We've tested Bluetooth ranges in our environment and could verify
that both KNOTs are able to capture the tag at a 70-meter distance. If we install KNOT-A and KNOT-B 140 meters apart, their Bluetooth ranges will not
overlap or overlap just slightly. When the tag moves into the KNOT-A range → the payload from the monitored tag will appear under the Bluetooth scanner
list →  the script will be initiated on a set schedule → an MQTT message with a report is going to be sent to the server →  and, finally, the server will display
that the tag is in the KNOT-A zone. When the tag moves into the KNOT-B range, the same happens, and the server will display that the tag is inside the
KNOT-B zone.
The actual Bluetooth operating distance can vary from site to site because a lot of different factors can impact it, like 2.4 GHz interference or the
surrounding materials used. For example, in line of sight, with no interference, the distance at which the KNOT is able to capture the tag's broadcasted
payload, can be up to 180 meters (KNOT — ~180 meters — TG-BT5-OUT). But you also have to keep in mind that with further distance, more packets will
be lost on the way. In the office environment, the range can go down to 30-100 meters.
Logically, if the Bluetooth operating ranges overlap and the tag is within the overlapped area (at the same time within KNOT-A and KNOT-B Bluetooth
ranges), both KNOTs will send the data and the server is going to show that the tag is reported by both devices at the same time.
Surely, there will be zones where two or more KNOT's Bluetooth ranges overlap and you can use it to your advantage. Basically, you will have information
that the tag, right now, is on the edges of the Bluetooth ranges in-between specific KNOT zones. In other words, when the asset moves into the
overlapped area, you will have information on the server that the asset is somewhere between the two KNOT operating ranges, which is useful information
to have as it gives more precision.
Additionally, the tag's output power can be reduced using Tx power parameter. Meaning, that even if the tag's payloads are broadcasted way too far and
they are caught by other KNOTs that are not supposed to see those payloads (at longer distances) → you can reduce the output power of the tag, which
will reduce the distance at which the KNOT is able to capture it. That way, you can "tweak" the "range" of reception and also avoid "interfering" with the
signal in other zones.
```
When testing locally to see how many payloads can the KNOT handle, we've achieved the following results →  with 300 tags (in factory
settings), scattered around the KNOT and using a Bluetooth filter "keep-newest" (which overwrites previously received payloads for each unique
MAC address with the newest one, so that the Bluetooth list would display 1 payload per 1 unique tag's MAC address at all times), all 300 MAC
addresses appeared in the KNOT's range after 30-40 seconds. This is where you need to keep in mind that all 300 tags broadcasting over the
same channels at the same time will cause interference (delay in the reception). When we "cleared" the Bluetooth payload list, each second the
list got 20 new entries and after about ~15 seconds, the list had 250-290 payloads. Then after ~15 seconds more, the list displayed all 300
unique tag payloads. The actual number of tags your KNOT is able to handle is heavily dependent on the environment, so it is better to test it on
sight.
```
The scripts we've prepared also allows you to set up a filter (that will be shown later on), which will make the KNOT ignore the payloads that the scanner
captures unless the signal strength (RSSI) is stronger than the specified value. In the Bluetooth scanner example print shown above under the "Introduction
" section, we can see that the KNOT sees one of the tags with an RSSI signal strength of -51 dBm (tag with a MAC address "DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D") and
the other one with an RSSI signal strength of -49 dBm (tag with a MAC address "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A"). So, if we apply a filter to the script to ignore all
payloads that are received with signal strength (RSSI) weaker than -50 dBm, our KNOT would report that only tag "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A" is within the
Bluetooth range, because its RSSI is -49 dBm, and the second tag (with RSSI -51 dBm) will be ignored. What this means, essentially, it is a second way of
"tweaking" the "range" of reception. The actual signal strength will vary between different locations (as mentioned before, because of interference and
surrounding materials), so it needs to be tested on sight.
Example #1
One of the use cases is shown in the topology below:
We have a warehouse area and we have 3 assets (pallets) that we are interested in tracking. We also have 3 zones: zone A, where newly arrived pallets
are stored; zone B, where our assets are relocated to be inspected; and zone C, where assets are moved after inspection. To achieve Bluetooth asset-
tracking, just install x1 KNOT per zone and x1 tag per asset.
If TAG 1 and TAG 2 (pallets) arrive in the "arrival" zone A, KNOT A will report to the server that both assets are within its Bluetooth range. If TAG 3 gets
moved to zone C, the server will indicate it is within the KNOT C range. If TAG 1 and TAG 2 move toward the B zone, and stay on the edges between A
and B zones, the server will show that it is in the overlapped area (at the same time within KNOT-A and KNOT-B ranges). If the tags move to the middle of
the warehouse, the server will indicate that they are in all 3 zones at once, in the overlapping area.
Configuration
In this example, we will showcase a basic topology, when two KNOTs are used and we just want to know whether the tag is located in one part of the
building or the other one (whether it is inside zone A or zone B).
ThingsBoard preparation
```
The scale of objects and Bluetooth operating ranges are just shown as an example, to help visually understand and imagine the topology!
```
Check the guide over here to understand how the ThingsBoard and the RouterOS can be set up to utilize MQTT communication.
Create 2 KNOTs under the ThingsBoard GUI and make them "gateways".
Go to the "Devices" section, click on "+" button and "Add new device":
Name the device and checkbox the "Is gateway" option:
Do that for each KNOT that you have:
Set up a unique access token (unique credentials) for each KNOT under the device you've just created, under the "Manage credentials" tab:
```
This example will showcase access-token scenario for simplicity reasons, but you can use other available options as well. For the production
environment, it is suggested to use SSL-MQTT, as non-SSL-MQTT can be easily packet captured and inspected.
```
```
To understand how to implement SSL-MQTT communication on the instance that is run with the container. Check the guide linked here (Enablin
g HTTPS and SSL MQTT section).
```
RouterOS configuration
Preparation
Before we proceed, we need to confirm that our Bluetooth tag actually appears in the KNOT's Bluetooth range and that the KNOT detects them. To do
that, you can issue the command "/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print":
```

The list can be chaotic. Random payloads can appear on the list as the scanner captures everything around it. To help reduce the list, you can filter it using

To figure out how to decypher the payload, please check the guide here.
MQTT broker
On each KNOT setup MQTT broker.
For KNOT A:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=1883 username=knot-A_access_token
```
Where:
```
name is the name that you wish to give to the broker and this name will be used later in the script;
address is the IP address of the broker/ThingsBoard server;
port is the TCP port that the broker is listening for → for non-SSL it is typically TCP 1883;
username is dictated by the MQTT broker and, in our case, it is an "access token" that was generated in the ThingsBoard management portal.
```
For KNOT B → Do the same step. Just change username to the respective access token that was generated for the KNOT B device (gateway).
Script
Import the script shown below to each KNOT. To do that, just copy the below shown "code" and paste it into a new terminal window and press "ENTER":
```

```
The script should appear under the "System>Scripts>Script List" tab with the name "tracking" or with the help of the command "/system script print".
There are certain script lines that you need to pay attention to.
Broker name configuration line, where you need to input the MQTT broker name that you have set:
```
:local broker "tb"
```
You need to input a correct topic, used by the MQTT broker. Check ThingsBoard documentation for more details and, by default, the topic should be:
```
:local topic "v1/gateway/telemetry"
```
MAC address filtering option inside the script itself. You can type in all 6 octets of the MAC address (to apply the filter to 1 specific tag), or you can filter the
list using a few/couple of octets, like "^BC:33:AC" (to apply the filter, so that only MAC addresses that begin with "BC:33:AC:..." would be processed):
```
:local addressRegex "DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D"
```
Payload content/data line. Allows you to filter the list, per specific payload content, like "manufacturer data". For example, "15ff4f09" would discard all
payloads that are not MikroTik format payloads:
```
:local advertisingDataRegex "15ff4f09"
```
RSSI signal strength filtering option. This filtering option was mentioned in the "Scenario explanation" section. This filter allows you to ignore any payload
that has RSSI weaker than the configured value. For example. "-40" would only include Bluetooth advertisements that have signal strength stronger than
-40dBm:
```
:local rssiThreshold "-40"
```
KNOT identifier line. You will need to change it for each unique KNOT. For example, name your first KNOT →  KNOT_A and your second KNOT
→  KNOT_B:
```
:local gwName "KNOT_A"
```
The rest of the script does not need to be changed/altered
How does the script work when you run it? The script "inspects" the "Advertising reports" tab (payload list tab) using the filters applied and structures a
JSON message. An example of the JSON message would be:
{
"2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A": [
{
"ts": 1678967250600,
"values": {
"reporter": "KNOT_A",
"rssi": -47
}
}
],
"DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D": [
{
"ts": 1678967247850,
"values": {
"reporter": "KNOT_A",
"rssi": -59
}
},
{
"ts": 1678967257849,
"values": {
"reporter": "KNOT_A",
"rssi": -67
}
}
]
}
The data is structured per the ThingsBoard guide, where "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A" and "DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D" are MAC addresses of tags that appeared
in the KNOT's range, "ts" is unix timestamp of each payload broadcasted by the tag in milliseconds, "reporter" indicates which specific KNOT has sent
the message and "rssi" is the signal strength of each payload broadcasted by the tag in dBm.
After the payload list is "searched" and the JSON message is structured, the Bluetooth interface payload list gets "cleaned" (or "flashed"), and the
previously structured JSON message is sent to the ThingsBoard MQTT broker.
To run the script, use the command:
```
/system script run tracking
```
Scheduler
Apply a scheduler to the script, so that RouterOS periodically initiates the script by itself:
```
/system/scheduler/add name=bluetoothscheduler interval=30s on-event="/system/script/run tracking"
```
You can set up shorter and longer intervals. If you want to send data more often, so that the data is "fresher" →  set up shorter time intervals (10-15
seconds). If you want to send fewer messages, less often → you can set up longer time intervals (30min+).
The JSON message structured using the script has a "ts" value (timestamp) assigned for each payload received. Meaning that when the script is run, for
example, every minute, 1 tag is used and the tag broadcasts 1 payload every 10 seconds (that is 6 payloads per minute) → ThingsBoard data (GUI) will be
updated every minute, and every minute, 6 new entries will appear (each entry will indicate that it was received 10 seconds after the previous one). And if
you send the message every 15 minutes when using 1 tag that is broadcasting a payload every 10 seconds (that is 6*15=90 payloads per 15 minutes) →
ThingsBoard data (GUI) will be updated every 15 minutes but 90 entries will appear.
ThingsBoard data visualization and result verification
After you run the script with /system script run tracking or via a scheduler and refresh the GUI portal → all MAC addresses (tags) that are found
in the JSON message, will be made into new devices under the ThingsBoard GUI:
To help you visualize the data, you can use the built-in widgets or create your own one.
Select the tag's MAC address from the list of devices, go to the "Latest telemetry" section, checkbox the "reporter" parameter, and click on the "Show on
widget" button:
Select a widget that you wish to use, for example under the "Cards" bundle, "Timeseries table" and click on "Add to dashboard":
Create a new dashboard and name it, however, you like. Click on "Add":
Do the same steps for your other tags that appeared under the "Devices" tab. Create a new widget for each unique tag under the same dashboard.
Change the widget's "Timewindow" from "Realtime-last minute" (which is used by default) to "Realtime-current day":
As a result, if both tags are inside the KNOT A range, the dashboard would show:
If they move to the KNOT B range, it would show:
If the tags move to the overlapped area, inside both ranges, both reporters (KNOT_A and KNOT_B) should show up within a few seconds after each other,
depending on the interval used in the scheduler:
Example #2
In the second example, we will showcase another topology:
We have a few warehouses, a few company delivery vehicles, and 3 assets that we are interested in tracking. Our assets are pallets that hold cargo and
our goals are to know:
```
in which specific warehouse (equipped with the KNOT) the asset (equipped with the tag) is currently in and how much time it spent inside the
specific warehouse;
whether the asset (equipped with the tag) is on the road, traveling between warehouses, and how much time it spent inside the vehicle (equipped
with the KNOT);
(optionally) if TG-BT5-OUT tags are used, what was the temperature during all this time? You can also/instead monitor other parameters that you
can get out of the advertised payload, like for example acceleration;
(optionally) find out the KNOT's GPS location.
```
To achieve Bluetooth asset-tracking, just install x1 KNOT per warehouse, x1 KNOT per vehicle, and x1 tag per asset.
We can see that TAG 1 is inside the vehicle, and this vehicle just parked near the warehouse. Both KNOT 1 and KNOT 4 will report to the server that the
asset is inside their ranges. This will tell you that the asset is parked but not being transported yet.
We can see that TAG 2 is traveling between the warehouses and is only inside the KNOT 5 Bluetooth range. In this case, KNOT 5 will be the only reporter
and the result that is displayed on the server would mean that the asset is getting transported.
We can see that TAG 3 is inside the warehouse. The server will indicate just that.
The data on the server will show the timestamps of each report sent by the KNOT, which will tell you for how long did the asset stay inside the specific
device's Bluetooth range.
Configuration
In this example, we will showcase a basic topology with 2 warehouses, 1 vehicle/truck traveling between them, and 1 asset/pallet/tag.
ThingsBoard preparation
Check the guide over here to understand how the ThingsBoard and the RouterOS can be set up to utilize MQTT communication.
Create 3 KNOTs under the ThingsBoard GUI and make them "gateways".
Go to the "Devices" section, click on "+" button and "Add new device":
Name the device and checkbox the "Is gateway" option:
```
This example will showcase access-token scenario for simplicity reasons, but you can use other available options as well. For the production
environment, it is suggested to use SSL-MQTT, as non-SSL-MQTT can be easily packet captured and inspected.
```
```
To understand how to implement SSL-MQTT communication on the instance that is run with the container. Check the guide linked here (Enablin
g HTTPS and SSL MQTT section).
```
Do that for each KNOT that you have:
Set up a unique access token (unique credentials) for each KNOT under the device you've just created, under the "Manage credentials" tab:
RouterOS configuration
Preparation
Before we proceed, we need to confirm that our Bluetooth tag actually appears in the KNOT's Bluetooth range and that the KNOT detects them. To do
that, you can issue the command "/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print":
```
/iot bluetooth scanners advertisements print

```
Where:

The script should appear under the "System>Scripts>Script List" tab with the name "tracking" or with the help of the command "/system script print".
There are certain script lines that you need to pay attention to.
Broker name configuration line, where you need to input the MQTT broker name that you have set:
```
:local broker "tb"
```
You need to input a correct topic, used by the MQTT broker. Check ThingsBoard documentation for more details and, by default, the topic should be:
```
:local topic "v1/gateway/telemetry"
```
MAC address filtering option inside the script itself. You can type in all 6 octets of the MAC address (to apply the filter to 1 specific tag), or you can filter the

```
:local advertisingDataRegex "15ff4f09"
```
RSSI signal strength filtering option. This filtering option was mentioned in the "Scenario explanation" section. This filter allows you to ignore any payload
that has RSSI weaker than the configured value. For example. "-40" would only include Bluetooth advertisements that have signal strength stronger than
-40dBm:

KNOT identifier line. You will need to change it for each unique KNOT. For example, ID your first KNOT as "1", your second KNOT as "2" and your third
KNOT as "3":
```
:local gwName "1"
```
The rest of the script does not need to be changed/altered
How does the script work when you run it? The script "inspects" the "Advertising reports" tab (payload list tab) using the filters applied and structures a
JSON message. An example of the JSON message would be:

### {

### "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A": [

### {
"ts": 1680526087729,
"values": {
"KNOT_1": "1",
"rssi": -47
}
}
],
"DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D": [
{
"ts": 1680526065000,
"values": {
"KNOT_1": "1",
"rssi": -49
}
},
{
"ts": 1680526075001,
"values": {
"KNOT_1": "1",
"rssi": -50
}
}
]
}
The data is structured per the ThingsBoard guide, where "2C:C8:1B:4B:BB:0A" and "DC:2C:6E:0F:C0:3D" are MAC addresses of tags that appeared
in the KNOT's range, "ts" is unix timestamp of each payload broadcasted by the tag in milliseconds, "KNOT_X" indicates which specific KNOT has sent the
message and "rssi" is the signal strength of each payload broadcasted by the tag in dBm.
After the payload list is "searched" and the JSON message is structured, the Bluetooth interface payload list gets "cleaned" (or "flashed"), and the
previously structured JSON message is sent to the ThingsBoard MQTT broker.
To run the script, use the command:
```
/system script run tracking
```
Script that includes temperature data (optional)
In case you wish to add temperature reports to the structured message, use the script below:
```

Because of the fact that floating point is not supported → every calculation behind a decimal point will be "rounded up" to a whole number. This
is why the script will calculate the temperature and acceleration values scaled by 1000 (multiplied by 1000 ).
So, if you see the temperature as temp=24750, the real temperature is 24.750 C. To add a decimal point, you will need to do an additional result
"translation" on the server side or with additional scripting on the RouterOS side, which will increase the CPU usage of the device.

This is where you need to keep in mind the BG77 modem behavior → BG77 cellular modem (used in the KNOT) can not be used to have a cellular CAT-M
/NB-IoT ongoing connection and to obtain GPS coordinates at the same time.
When the script is run:
```
PPP interface is disabled and the highest priority is set for GPS reception (while the cellular PPP interface is down) for 32 seconds (this time can
be altered in the script);
(a) If the device managed to obtain GPS latitude value during the configured 32 seconds (if the value obtained equals anything other than
"none"), the script will structure a JSON message with captured latitude and longitude values, the script will set the highest priority for WWAN
(change the priority from GPS to WWAN) and enable PPP interface back (for internet access). After that, the script will send GPS data JSON
message via the first MQTT publish and, the script will run the Bluetooth part, where the Bluetooth data JSON message is structured and sent via
the second MQTT publish (x2 MQTT messages are sent → GPS data MQTT message and Bluetooth data MQTT message);
(b) If the device fails to obtain GPS latitude value during the 32-second interval (if the value obtained equals "none"), the script sets the highest
priority for WWAN (changes the priority from GPS to WWAN), enables PPP interface back (for internet access) and just processes the Bluetooth
part, where the Bluetooth data JSON message is structured and sent via MQTT publish (basically, if GPS data could not be obtained, x1 MQTT
message with Bluetooth data is sent).
```
Scheduler
Apply a scheduler to the script, so that RouterOS periodically initiates the script by itself:
```
/system/scheduler/add name=bluetoothscheduler interval=50s on-event="/system/script/run tracking"
```
You can set up shorter and longer intervals. If you want to send data more often, so that the data is "fresher" →  set up shorter time intervals (10-15
seconds). If you want to send fewer messages, less often → you can set up longer time intervals (30min+).
The JSON message structured using the script has a "ts" value (timestamp) assigned for each payload received. Meaning that when the script is run, for
example, every minute, 1 tag is used and the tag broadcasts 1 payload every 10 seconds (that is 6 payloads per minute) → ThingsBoard data (GUI) will be
updated every minute, and every minute, 6 new entries will appear (each entry will indicate that it was received 10 seconds after the previous one). And if
you send the message every 15 minutes when using 1 tag that is broadcasting a payload every 10 seconds (that is 6*15=90 payloads per 15 minutes) →
ThingsBoard data (GUI) will be updated every 15 minutes but 90 entries will appear.
ThingsBoard data visualization and result verification
After you run the script with /system script run tracking or via a scheduler and refresh the GUI portal → all MAC addresses (tags) that are found
in the JSON message, will be made into new devices under the ThingsBoard GUI:
To help you visualize the data, you can use the built-in widgets or create your own one.
Select the tag's MAC address from the list of devices, go to the "Latest telemetry" section, checkbox KNOT IDs that you wish to monitor, and click on the
"Show on widget" button:
Select a widget that you wish to use, for example under the "Charts" bundle, "Timeseries Bar Chart" and click on "Add to dashboard":
Create a new dashboard and name it, however, you like. Click on "Add":
Change the widget's "Timewindow" from "Realtime-last minute" (which is used by default) to "Realtime-last 5 hours" and disable "data aggregation
function" (select "none"):
To help you better visualize the result, edit the widget and then edit each "KNOT_X" parameter/key. Enable the "Show points" checkbox for each key:
Check the ThingsBoard widget guide for more options that you have.
The end result would look like this:
Per the dashboard, we can tell that:
```
from ~11:00 to ~11:30, our asset was inside KNOT_1 Bluetooth range (inside warehouse #1);
from ~11:30 to ~11:35, our asset was relocated to the vehicle (KNOT_2) that was parked near the warehouse (the tag was inside both KNOT's
ranges);
from ~11:35 to ~12:00, the tag was inside the truck (KNOT_2) - traveling to another warehouse;
from ~12:00 to ~12:05, the asset was parked outside of warehouse #2, and it was inside both KNOT_2 and KNOT_3 ranges at the same time;
from ~12:05 to 12:30, our asset was stored inside warehouse #2 (KNOT_3);
from ~12.:30 onwards, the tag was on the road again, inside the truck (KNOT_2).
```
Temperature visualization (optional)
Select the tag's MAC address from the list of devices, go to the "Latest telemetry" section, checkbox "temp" parameter, and click on the "Show on widget"
button:
Select a widget that you wish to use, for example under the "Charts" bundle, "Timeseries Line Chart". Click on "Add to dashboard", and choose the
dashboard where you want to add the widget.
The result would look like this:
Now you have an additional graph that indicates how the tag's temperature changes during different time intervals.
GPS coordinate visualization (optional)
Per the script in the Script that includes GPS data section, the script sends x2 MQTT messages. Each message is sent to a different MQTT topic. GPS
coordinate message will be posted to a topic named "1/devices/me/telemetry", while Bluetooth data will be posted to a topic named "v1/gateway
/telemetry". Coordinates will be available to you under the ThingsBoard device list, under the specific gateway:
Checkbox both "latitude" and "longitude" parameters, click on the "Show on widget button", select "Current bundle" to "Maps", and choose the "Route Map
- OpenStreetMap" widget:
To finish things up, click on the "Add to dashboard" button and choose the dashboard where you want the widget to be shown.
After adding 3 widgets into 1 dashboard (temperature line chart, Bluetooth reporter bar chart, and GPS coordinates map), you would get something similar
to this:
```
You will have a graph showing temperature changes (the tag's surrounding temperature);
You will have the chart that indicates which specific KNOT has sent the report, that tells you in which KNOT's Bluetooth range the tag is currently
in;
You will have a map that shows the GPS position of the KNOT.
```

# GPIO

RouterOS configuration
/iot gpio analog
/iot gpio digital
Different scenarios
Controlling relays
Monitoring input signal
Monitoring voltage
```
note: In order to access GPIO settings, make sure that iot package is installed beforehand.
You can find more information about GPIO following the link.
GPIO stands for General-Purpose Input/Output. It is a digital signal pin/pins on the routerboard that allows you to send/receive the signal. It can be useful
in different scenarios, like:
```
Measuring voltage through ADC input
Reading 0 and 1 signal received from another device - "dry contact"
Controlling connected relays by sending logical 0 or 1 signal to the pin
```

## RouterOS configuration
note: GPIO settings are available only using CLI.
Sub-menu: /iot gpio
GPIO settings are divided into:
```
analog (/iot gpio analog)
digital (/iot gpio digital)
```
note: in our examples, we are using KNOT as a reference device. Other devices may have a different pinout but the same principles apply.

## /iot gpio analog
note: please check on a product page whether your hardware supports analog input or not.
In the "analog" setting you can measure voltages on the analog input/ADC input pins:
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio analog> print
# NAME VALUE OFFSET
0 pin2 0mV 0mV
1 pin3 32mV 0mV
```
"OFFSET" can be used to manually compensate voltage drop on the wires. "VALUE" is measured with:
value = adc_input + offset
, where adc_input is the voltage on the pin.
"OFFSET" configuration example is shown below:
```
Please note that long-term (6.47.10) and stable (6.48.3) versions, you have to use "/system gpio", command structure remains the same as in "
/iot gpio" examples, aside from "analog" and "digital" sub-menus, which were added in later versions. Versions 6.49beta54+ and RouterOS v7,
use "/iot gpio" sub-menu.
```
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio analog> set pin2 offset
```
```
Offset ::= [-]Num[mV]
Num ::= -2147483648..2147483647 (integer number)
```
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio analog> set pin2 offset 2
[admin@device] /iot gpio analog> print
# NAME VALUE
OFFSET
0 pin2
2mV 2mV
1 pin3
0mV 0mV
```
/iot gpio digital
In the "digital" section you can send/receive a logical 0 or 1 signal using the digital output/input pins (output pins are "open drain"):
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME DIRECTION OUTPUT INPUT
SCRIPT
0 pin5 input 0 0
1 pin4 output 0
2 pin6 output 0
```
"DIRECTION" for the pin can be either "input" (a pin that can receive the signal) or "output" (a pin that can send the signal).
When the pin's direction is set to "output", you can configure the "OUTPUT" value. Changing the "OUTPUT" value sends the signal to the pin.
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> set pin4 output=
```
```
Output ::= 0 | 1
```
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> set pin4 output=1
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME DIRECTION OUTPUT INPUT
SCRIPT
0 pin5 input 0 0
1 pin4 output 1
2 pin6 output 0
```
The "SCRIPT" field allows you to configure a script, that will be initiated whenever the "INPUT" or "OUTPUT" value changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
```
KNOT pin's "DIRECTION" for pin4 and pin6 can not be changed. Both pins are meant to be used only as "output" pins.
```
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> set pin4 script=script1
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> set pin5 script="/system .."
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME DIRECTION OUTPUT INPUT
SCRIPT
0 pin5 input 0 0 /system
..
1 pin4 output 1
script1
2 pin6 output 0
```
Different scenarios
Controlling relays
One of the scenarios for the GPIO implementation is "controlling other relays" using digital output pins. Basically, sending "0" or "1" signal to the unit that is
connected to the pin. To automate the process, you can use a scheduler, which will run the script at specific times.
For example, you can add the first script (a single line shown below) and name it "output=0":
```
/iot gpio digital set pin4 output=0
```
Then add a second script (a single line shown below) and name it "output=1":
```
/iot gpio digital set pin4 output=1
```
Having both scripts, you can configure a schedule:
```
[admin@device] /system scheduler> add name=run-30s interval=30s on-event="output=0"
```
The schedule configuration shown above will run the script with the name "output=0", every 30 seconds.
```
[admin@device] /system scheduler> add name=run-45s interval=45s on-event="output=1"
```
The schedule configuration shown above will run the script with the name "output=1", every 45 seconds.
As a result, the device will automatically send a signal to the 4th pin (digital output pin) with output value=0 every 30 seconds and a signal with output
value=1 every 45 seconds.
You can change the scheduled time as you see fit (depending on the requirements).
Monitoring input signal
Another scenario is to "monitor input signal" using the digital input pins. You need a script that will initiate e-mail notification or MQTT/HTTPS (fetch)
publish whenever the "INPUT" value changes for the pin with the direction="input" (whenever the RouterOS device receives a signal "0 or 1" from another
device connected to the pin).
E-mail notification script:
```
/tool e-mail send to=config@mydomain.com subject=[/system identity get name] body="$[/iot gpio digital get pin5 input]"
```
After creating a script, apply/set it to the "input" pin:
```
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> set pin5 script=script1
[admin@device] /iot gpio digital> print
Flags: X - disabled
# NAME DIRECTION OUTPUT INPUT SCRIPT
0 pin5 input 0 0 script1
1 pin4 output 0 script1
2 pin6 output 0
```
In the example above, the e-mail notification script is named "script1".
As a result, whenever the input value changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0), the script automatically initiates an e-mail notification that will display the input
value in the e-mail body.
Do not forget to change the script line and configure the e-mail settings (/tool e-mail) accordingly:
```
/tool e-mail send to="config@mydomain.com" subject="[/system identity get name]"  body="$[/iot gpio digital get pin5 input]"
```
Configure the actual e-mail address that you use. You can also change the subject and the body for the mail as you see fit.
MQTT publish script:
```
:local broker "name"
```
```
:local topic "topic"
```
```
:local message "{\"inputVALUE\":$[/iot gpio digital get pin5 input]}"
/iot mqtt publish broker=$broker topic=$topic message=$message
```
This script works the same way as the "e-mail notification" script, only when the input value changes the script initiates MQTT publish (instead of e-mail
notification) and sends the input value received on the pin in the JSON format.
Do not forget to set up MQTT broker (/iot mqtt brokers add ..) and alter a few script lines beforehand:
```
:local broker "name"
```
The broker's "name" should be changed accordingly (you can check all created brokers and their names using CLI command /iot mqtt brokers print).
```
:local topic "topic"
```
The topic should be changed as well. The topic itself is configured on the server-side, so make sure that the correct topic is used.
Do not forget to apply/set the script to pin5 (/iot gpio digital set pin5 script=script_name), as shown in the "email notification" example above.
If the mechanical switch is used to send the signal to the GPIO pin, it is suggested to use the following script instead (in case the script is initiated more
than once when the signal is received on the pin):
```
:global gpioscriptrunning;
if (!$gpioscriptrunning) do={:set $gpioscriptrunning true;
:log info "script started - GPIO changed";
:do {if ([/iot gpio digital get pin5 input] = "0") do={/tool e-mail send to="config@mydomain.com" subject=[/system identity get name]
body="pin5 received logical 0"} else {/tool e-mail send to="config@mydomain.com" subject=[/system identity get name]  body="pin5
received logical 1"};
:delay 1s;
:set $gpioscriptrunning false} on-error={:set $gpioscriptrunning false;
:log info "e-mail error, resetting script state..."}}
```
If the GPIO pin state changes more than once within mili/microseconds - the script above is going to make sure that e-mail notification is not sent more
than once.
Monitoring voltage
Last but not least - is to "monitor voltage" using the analog pins.  You need a script that will read/monitor voltage on schedule and then send the data via e-
mail, MQTT or HTTPS (fetch).
Create a script, as shown below. In this example, we will be using MQTT publish (but you can create a similar script with "/tool e-mail .." to use e-mail
notifications):
```
:local broker "name"
```
```
:local topic "topic"
```
```
:local message "{\"voltage(mV)\":$[/iot gpio analog get pin3 value]}"
/iot mqtt publish broker=$broker topic=$topic message=$message
```
The script will read/measure the voltage on pin3 and publish the data to the MQTT broker.
Do not forget to set up MQTT broker (/iot mqtt brokers add ..) and alter a few script lines beforehand:
```
:local broker "name"
```
The broker's "name" should be changed accordingly (you can check all created brokers and their names using CLI command /iot mqtt brokers print).
```
:local topic "topic"
```
The topic should be changed as well. The topic itself is configured on the server-side, so make sure that the correct topic is used.
Save the script and name it, for example, "voltagepublish". To automate the process, you can use the scheduler.
```
[admin@device] /system scheduler> add name=run-45s interval=45s on-event="voltagepublish"
```
The schedule configuration shown above will run the script every 45 seconds.

##  General Properties
Gateways initial steps and different LoRaWAN setup examples:

##  Setup
The term "LoRa" represents the "radio" itself ("LoRa payloads" are packets broadcasted by the nodes using the LoRa frequencies), while the term
"LoRaWAN" represents a logical/link layer on top, that enables the communication between "LoRa" devices. In other words, "LoRaWAN" is how the "LoRa"
radio devices communicate.
R11e-LR8 (operates in 863-870 MHz frequency), R11e-LR9 (operates in 902-928 MHz frequency) and R11e-LR2 (operates using 2.4 GHz frequencies)
are concentrator Gateway cards for LoRa® technology in mini PCIe form factor based on Semtech chipset. They enable LoRa® connectivity for any
MikroTik product that has mPCIe slot with connected USB lines.
A typical LoRaWAN topology consists of 3 main elements → the server, the node and the gateway. The gateway's job is to simply forward received LoRa
packets that are broadcasted by the nodes (within the same supported frequency spectrum) to the server.
MikroTik LoRaWAN gateways are devices that have R11e-LRx miniPCIe card and have "iot" package (which enables LoRa drivers) installed.
The primary design for the MikroTik gateway devices is to operate as LoRaWAN devices. To achieve this, simply configure/select a correct server in the
LoRa interface settings. A few examples can be found in the setup section.
However, if you do not wish to use a LoRaWAN network/topology, and you wish to forward "raw LoRa" payloads to your own server, you have an option to
do so. You can use MQTT or HTTP post to forward received payloads to your MQTT/HTTP server, but it will require additional scripting. The script will
have to collect information (payloads) from the IoT>LoRa>Traffic tab, store those payloads as variables, structure MQTT/HTTP message out of the
variables and post it.
```
Please note that if the payloads broadcasted by the node are encrypted, and you wish to forward them to your own MQTT/HTTP server (without
using LoRaWAN), you will need to decipher the payloads on the server-side. The gateway does not have the built-in functionality to decipher
node's data. Servers are responsible for this task.

Every RouterBOARD with a miniPCI-e slot which supports LTE modems can also be used as a LoRaWAN gateway by installing R11e-LoRa8 or R11e-
LoRa9 card. Both UDP and LNS (starting with v7.12rc1 testing version) protocols are supported.
In order to work with Lora, IoT package should be installed. You can find the package for your device architecture in extra packages archive on the download
page.

```
Antenna gain in dBi. This value should be equal to setup-antenna-gain minus cable-loss. Using 6.5 dBi
antenna, 6.5 is the value to be configured (not taking into account cable loss).
```
```
Output power of the gateway is dictated by the server. The gateway will calculate its actual output power by
subtracting antenna-gain setting from server_value (value received in the downlink message).

Defines what kind of packets should be forwarded to Network server:
```
```
crc-validtaion - Forward valid packets with correct CRC.
dev-addr-validtaion - Checks if DevAddr of the packet corresponds to the NetID and if not, drops the packet.
The following sequence happens: 1) Dev. Addr value gets "obtained" from the received LoRa packet; 2) Dev.
Addr is "compared" against "valid" Net IDs list; 3) If there is no Net ID for the Dev. Addr, the packet is not
forwarded; 4) If Net ID is valid, Dev. Addr range is valid, the packet is forwarded.
proprietary-traffic - Checks the content of the LoRa packet and if the "type" of the frame is "proprietary", the
packet is not forwarded.
```
```
gateway-id (string) Gateway ID or Gateway EUI, is used when registering the gateway with the server.
```
```
lbt-enabled (yes | no; Default: no) Whether gateway should use LBT (Listen Before Talk) protocol.

To view current channels, issue the command /iot lora cannels print:
```
/iot lora channels print
Columns: NAME, TYPE, RADIO, FREQ-OFF, BANDWIDTH, FREQ, SPREAD-FACTOR, DATARATE
# NAME TYPE RADIO FREQ-OFF BANDWIDTH FREQ SPREAD-FACTOR DATARATE
0 gateway-0 MSF radio1 -400000 125_kHz 868.1
1 gateway-0 MSF radio1 -200000 125_kHz 868.3
2 gateway-0 MSF radio1 0 125_kHz 868.5
3 gateway-0 MSF radio0 -400000 125_kHz 867.1
4 gateway-0 MSF radio0 -200000 125_kHz 867.3
5 gateway-0 MSF radio0 0 125_kHz 867.5

9 gateway-0 FSK radio1 300000 125_kHz 868.8 50000
```
```
Once the server is selected and LoRa interface is enabled using /iot lora enable [find] command, the device will start operating as a
LoRaWAN gateway. It will start forwarding LoRa payloads from the /iot lora traffic tab to the configured server.
```
Channels are created using freq-off and radio's center-freq frequencies. To view radios center frequencies use the command /iot lora
radios print.
To understand how each channel's frequency is calculated, check the example below:

### # NAME TYPE RADIO FREQ-OFF BANDWIDTH FREQ SPREAD-FACTOR DATARATE
```
0 gateway-0 MSF radio1 -400000 125_kHz 868.1
```
radio1 is selected to be used for channel #0 and it is configured with center-freq=868500000 (868500000 Hz or 868.5 MHz).
By using frequency offset, freq-off=-400000 (-400000 Hz or -0.4 MHz), we define channel #0 to be 868500000-400000=868100000 Hz or 868.1
MHz.
Join EUI
The gateway will forward to the server every single LoRaWAN payload it receives. That includes neighboring LoRaWAN node's payloads as well. It might
not be ideal to forward everything, as, for example, it can increase the data amount used (and directly impact ISP plan cost).
The Join EUI menu allows you to specify a range of Join EUI's that the gateway will forward. After adding the range, make sure to apply it to the server
settings.
If the Join EUI of the packet does not match the configuration, the packet is not forwarded to the server.
You can find the Join EUI used by your node with the help of RouterOS GUI. Go to the "LoRa" section and to the "Traffic" sub-menu (which is only
available using the graphical interface). After you power your LoRaWAN node, the node should send a "Join-request" packet. Double-click on it to inspect
it:
Sub-menu: /iot lora joineui
```
Property Description
```
```
joineui (string; Default: ) Define a range of Join EUI's.
```
```
logging (yes | no; Default: no) Enables additional logging for the filter feature.
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Define the name for the range.
```
```
To configure custom channels, select "custom" channel profle with the help of the command:
```
```
/iot lora set [find] channel-plan=custom
```
An example of Join EUI would look like this E0 E1 E2 01 02 03 04 05. It consists of 8 octets in HEX format.
To add a range that allows every possible Join EUI, add a filter like this:
```
/iot lora joineui add name=ALL joineuis=0000000000000000-ffffffffffffffff
```
To add a range that allows "nothing" (basically "restrict" all Join EUI's), add a filter like this:
```
/iot lora joineui add name=NONE joineuis=0000000000000000-0000000000000000
```
For a specific single Join EUI, add a filter like this:
```
/iot lora joineui add name=SINGLE joineuis=E0E1E20102030405-E0E1E20102030405
```
Network ID
The gateway will forward to the server every single LoRaWAN payload it receives. That includes neighboring LoRaWAN node's payloads as well. It might
not be ideal to forward everything, as, for example, it can increase the data amount used (and directly impact ISP plan cost).
The NetID menu allows you to specify a list of NetIDs that the gateway will forward. After adding the list, make sure to apply it to the server settings.
If the NetID (DevAddr range) of the packet does not match the configuration, the packet is not forwarded to the server.
NetIDs define the ranges of Device Addresses (DevAddr) that were assigned to different operators/servers by the LoRaWAN Alliance. A list with most
ranges can be found in the TTN guide.
DevAddr is assigned to the LoRaWAN node by the LoRaWAN server after the communication with the server takes place. For example, TTN will assign
your node an address from within the range 26000000 - 27FFFFFF. You can find it under the LoRaWAN server dashboard or using RouterOS GUI, under
the "Traffic" sub-menu (after "join-request" and "join-accept" communication takes place) in the Dev Addr column/field.
Let's say TTN assigned 26 1B D8 D1 Dev Addr to your node. Based on the TTN guide, it falls under the 26000000 - 27FFFFFF DevAddr range and it
belongs to the 000013 NetID.
Sub-menu: /iot lora netid
```
Property Description
```
```
netids (string; Default: ) Define the NetIDs
```
```
logging (yes | no; Default: no) Enables additional logging for the filter feature.
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Define the name for the ID.
```
To add a filter for a specific NetId, use the command (you can add more than one using a "comma" separator):
```
/iot lora netids add name=TTN netids=000013
```
Servers
This section is used to add new or alter current server settings.
Sub-menu: /iot lora servers
There are a few predefined servers that can be used (it requires to make an The Things Network account to use them):
```
[admin@MikroTik] /iot/lora/servers/print
Columns: NAME, UP-PORT, DOWN-PORT, ADDRESS
# NAME UP-PORT DOWN-PORT ADDRESS
0 TTS Cloud (eu1) 1700 1700 eu1.cloud.thethings.industries
1 TTS Cloud (nam1) 1700 1700 nam1.cloud.thethings.industries

TLS server authentication). When this option is choosen, root SSL certificate(s) must be uploaded under the certificates menu.
```
```
certificate (list of
string; Default: none)
```
```
Parameter that is used when LNS or CUPS protocol is selected. Select an uploaded client certificate (if the server awaits TLS
client authentication). If TLS client authentication is not required by the server, use the default "none" setting.
```
```
interval (integer [0..
65535]; Default: )
```
```
Parameter that is used when CUPS protocol is selected. Specify the interval with which the LoRa Basics Station will query CUPS
server for configuration updates/changes.
```
There are a few pre-configued The Things default servers. If you deleted one and want to recover default servers, you can use the command:
```
/iot lora server reset-servers
```
```
Please be warned that resetting servers will delete all previously configured servers as well, so make sure to "save" them beforehand.

To clear the list (to remove all entries), issue the clear command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /iot/lora/traffic/clear
```
Traffic tab displays "LoRa" payloads. As soon as the LoRa interface is enabled with the /iot lora enable [find] command, all the payloads from
the list will be converted into TCP/UDP packets (depending on whether you use UDP 1700 or LNS/CUPS protocol) and forwarded to the configured server.
If you do not wish to use LoRaWAN topology, and if you wish to forward "raw" LoRa payloads to your own server, you have an option to do so, using MQTT
or Fetch post (HTTP post). To do that, remove the LoRa server configuration (so that no server is selected by the LoRa interface, thus the payloads are
not forwarded anywhere) and then you will have to create a script. The script will have to store the traffic as variables, structure MQTT/HTTP messages out
of them (in a format that your server expects to receive the data) and then send it. After that, you can apply a scheduler, to run the script with an interval of
your choice to constantly send the data.
A basic example (first step in the script) on how to convert traffic payloads into a varible called "traffic":
```
[admin@MikroTik] > :global traffic;:set traffic [/iot lora traffic print as-value ];put $traffic
.id=*4f;band=125 kHz;coderate=?/?;counter=890652548;crc=Error;datarate=SF 7;freqhz=868300;gwid=50313xxxxxx;ifcha

```
Debugging
If you have issues with the connection, make sure to enable logs:
```
/system/logging/add topics=debug,lora
```
This will enable debug logging and help you pin point where the potential issue could be. Logs can be viewed using:
```
/log/print
```
A successful connection would look like this:
```

Connection verification
```
Before we proceed with the settings, you need to create an account in the AWS system. You can find more information on how to do that following this link.
After you are logged-in, go to Services>IoT Core section on the portal.

## AWS - Registering the gateway
The first step is to register the LoRaWAN gateway.
Navigate to the Gateways section (under LPWAN devices).
Click on the "Add gateway" button.

## Step 1 - add gateway
```
Input the gateway's EUI;
Select device's frequency band;
Configure optional fields if required;
```
```
This scenario will work starting with RouterOS version 7.14beta8.
```
Finish the step by clicking on the "Add gateway" once again.
In RouterOS settings, gateway's EUI and frequency plan can be checked under IoT>LoRa>Devices tab:
Step 2 - configure your gateway
```
Generate a gateway certificate ("Create certificate" button), and download the certificate file and private key files ("Download certificate files"
button);
Copy CUPS and LNS endpoints and download server trust certificates ("Download server trust certificates" button);
Add suggested gateway permissions;
```
Finish the step by clicking on "Submit".
You will be redirected to the page where your newly created gateway should appear.
RouterOS - Connecting the gateway
Uploading and importing certificates
Before we proceed with the setup, you need to download Amazon Root CA and upload it, together with the gateway certificate file and its key, into the
RouerOS file list menu:
After the files were uploaded, import the certificates, one by one (under System>Certificates):
Make sure to upload the gateway certificate first and then its key (so that the gateway certificate has both K-key and T-trusted flags present). In the end,
you should have all 3 file imported, like so:
Server configuration
LNS scenario
Navigate to the IoT>LoRa>Servers tab and add a new server:
```
Name the server;
Input LNS endpoint address (without "wss://" and ":443");
Select LNS protocol;
Change port to "443";
Enable SSL checkbox;
Select gateway certificate.
```
Make sure to apply newly configured server under IoT>LoRa>Devices tab:
And then, enable the LoRa interface.
CUPS scenario
Navigate to the IoT>LoRa>Servers tab and add a new server:
```
Name the server;
Input CUPS endpoint address (without "https://" and ":443");
Select CUPS protocol;
Change port to "443";
Enable SSL checkbox;
Select gateway certificate.
```
Make sure to apply newly configured server under IoT>LoRa>Devices tab:
And then, enable the LoRa interface.
Connection verification
If everything is configured correctly, you should see "connected" status on the AWS portal:


# Step by step installation

## LoRa card installation
LtAP LTE kit will be used as example in this section.
Open your routers case. Once you have removed all the screws carefully move the upper case to the left side, as the LTE antennas are attached to the
inner side of it.
Insert R11e-LoRa card into the mini-PCIe slot and apply two screws to the threaded inserts.
Attach antenna to the card (UFL connector)
In this case UFL → SMA cable is also used, as the LtAP's case has a specific slot for it.
Once the previous steps are done, you can close the routers case and move on to configuration.
Configuration
GUI setup
Connect to your router via Winbox or WebFig.
Winbox can be downloaded in the link given below:
https://mikrotik.com/download
It is Highly recommended to upgrade your RouterOS version to the latest available. Installing the version will perform a reboot:
If your device does not have IoT>LoRa menu, download "Extra packages" specifically for your routers architecture and rOS version. You can see the type
of your routers architecture at the top of Winbox window or in System →  Resources → Architecture Name.
https://mikrotik.com/download
Once the package is downloaded and extracted, upload the IoT package to your router. It can be done via drag & drop as well. It should appear in the files
folder after the upload is complete, reboot your router (System → Reboot) to install the package:
After the reboot, the package should be visible in the Package list:
Check if the LoRa gateway has initialized under IoT>LoRa>Devices. If it is LtAP model, make sure to set USB Type to Mini-PCIe:
Once the gateway has shown up (under IoT>LoRa>Devices) select it, choose Network Servers from the default ones or add your own (under IoT>LoRa>Se
rvers) and enable it:
Navigate to Traffic tab to monitor the surrounding nodes sending requests:
This concludes basic installation and configuration of LoRa mini-PCIe cards. For additional settings check: General Properties


# The Things Network
Once you have installed the lora package on your router and created an account on The Things Network you can set up a running gateway
```
Login into your account and go to Console and select Gateways
```
```
Select register gateway and fill in the blank spaces. Gateway EUI can be found in your lora interface
```
```
You will have to manually add the Network Servers, or you can upgrade your router to the stable version 6.48.2 and these servers will be added
automatically (highly recommended)
https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Upgrading_RouterOS
```
/lora servers
add address=eu1.cloud.thethings.industries down-port=1700 name="TTS Cloud (eu1)" up-port=1700
add address=nam1.cloud.thethings.industries down-port=1700 name="TTS Cloud (nam1)" up-port=1700
add address=au1.cloud.thethings.industries down-port=1700 name="TTS Cloud (au1)" up-port=1700
```
After everything is filled press Register Gateway at the bottom of the page. If you have set everything accordingly to the previous steps you
should see that your lora gateway is now connected
```
```
At this point everything is set and you have a working lora gateway. You can monitor incoming packets in Traffic section
```
*Later this year, The Things Network will be migrating to a new version of network server, called The Things Stack.


# The Things Stack

## Selecting a region
The Things Stack is a new version of The Things network.
Choose your region and login with The Things network account or other credentials.

## Registering gateway
Once logged in, navigate to "Go to gateways":
Register a gateway by clicking on the "+ Register gateway" button:
UDP protocol gateway registration
Fill in the blank spaces. Input Gateway EUI. Make sure to select a correct frequency plan. Do not enable "Require authenticated connection" option (it is
used for LNS and CUPS)!
In RouterOS, Gateway EUI value can be found under "IoT>LoRa>Devices>Gateway ID"):
For additional information check their documentation page.
UDP scenario RouterOS settings
Double-check that the correct TTN server is selected by the LoRa device (in RouterOS) and that the server setting uses "UDP" protocol:
LNS and CUPS protocol gateway registration
Fill in the blank spaces. Input Gateway EUI. Make sure to select a correct frequency plan. Enable "Require authenticated connection" and the follow-up (for
LNS) "Generate API key for LNS" and (for CUPS) "Generate API key for CUPS" options:
In RouterOS, Gateway EUI value can be found under "IoT>LoRa>Devices>Gateway ID":
After clicking on "Register gateway" button, you should be prompted to download the keys. Download them.
To view LNS and CUPS keys, inspect download files. LNS key should also be visible under the "LoRa Basics Station LNS authentication Key" field:
For additional information check their documentation page.
LNS scenario RouterOS settings
Make sure that the correct TTN server is selected, that the correct port is configured (TTN expects LNS over 8887), that LNS protocol is chosen, that the
LNS key (from the "LoRa Basics Station LNS authentication Key" field) is input and that "SSL" checkbox is enabled:
The last step is to download and import Root Certificates. The page has links to the required file.
After the certificate file was downloaded, drag and drop it into the RouterOS file menu and import the certificate list:
This should make the certificate list trusted:
CUPS scenario RouterOS settings
Make sure that the correct TTN server is selected, that the correct port is configured (TTN expects CUPS over 443), that CUPS protocol is chosen, that the
CUPS key is input and that "SSL" checkbox is enabled:
The last step is to download and import Root Certificates. The page has links to the required file.
After the certificate file was downloaded, drag and drop it into the RouterOS file menu and import the certificate list:
This should make the certificate list trusted:

## Summary
MQTT is an open OASIS and ISO standard lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. A typical MQTT
communication topology consists of:
```
an MQTT publisher → a device that sends information to the server;
an MQTT broker → a server where the data is stored;
an MQTT subscriber → a device that reads/monitors the data published on the server.
```
RouterOS can act as an MQTT publisher and subscriber (starting with 7.11beta2). You can also run an MQTT broker/server via the container feature. For
Mosquitto MQTT broker configuration visit the link here.
You can find application examples for MQTT publish scenarios below:
a) MQTT/HTTPS example with AWS cloud platform
b) MQTT example with Azure cloud platform
c) MQTT and ThingsBoard configuration
Please note that AWS and Azure examples (scripts) showcase publishing Bluetooth tag data. Currently, only the KNOT has a Bluetooth chip built-in.

## Configuration
Sub-menu: /iot mqtt
note:  iot package is required.
IoT package is available with RouterOS version 6.48.3. You can get it from our download page - under "Extra packages".

```
/iot mqtt brokers add
```
Configurable properties are shown below:
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IP|hostname;
Default: )
```
```
IP address or hostname of the broker.
```
```

When enabled, after the connection with the MQTT broker goes down/gets interrupted, RouterOS will try to re-establish the
connection over and over again.
```
```
certificate (string; Default:
)
```
```
The certificate that is going to be used for the SSL connection.
```
```
client-id (string; Default: ) A unique ID used for the connection. The broker uses this ID to identify the client.
```

```
```
parallel-scripts-limit (integ
er:3..1000; Default: off)
```
```
A parameter that defines how many scripts the on-message feature for this broker is allowed to run at the exact same time.
Can be useful to reduce CPU, in cases when a large number of messages are constantly published.
```
```
password (string; Default:
)
```
```
Password for the broker (if required by the broker).
```
```

An example of adding a broker:
```
/iot mqtt brokers add name="broker" address="192.168.88.33" port=1883 ssl=no client-id="test-client" auto-
connect=no keep-alive=60
```
The result:
```
/iot mqtt brokers print
0 name="broker" address="192.168.88.33" port=1883 ssl=no client-id="test-client" auto-connect=no keep-alive=60
connected=no
```
Connect
To connect to the pre-configured MQTT broker, issue the command:
```
/iot mqtt connect broker="broker"
```
If the connection is successful, the "connected" parameter should change to "yes":
```
/iot mqtt brokers print
0 name="broker" address="192.168.88.33" port=1883 ssl=no client-id="test-client" auto-connect=no keep-alive=60
connected=yes
```
Disconnect
To disconnect from the MQTT broker, issue the command:
```
/iot mqtt disconnect broker="broker"
```
To confirm that the broker was disconnected, issue the command below and it should indicate "connected=no":
```
/iot mqtt brokers print
0 name="broker" address="192.168.88.33" port=1883 ssl=no client-id="test-client" auto-connect=no keep-alive=60
connected=no
```
Publish
Publish menu is used to send MQTT messages to the MQTT broker.
```
Property Description
```
```
broker (string
; Default: )
```
```
Select the broker, where to publish the message.
```
```
disconnect-
after (yes |
no; Default:
no)
```
```
Parameter, that ensures that the connection with the broker will be automatically disconnected after the publish message is sent.
```
```
force (yes |
no; Default:
yes)
```
```
If set to "yes", when the connection with the broker is not yet established ("connected=no"), and the message is attempted to be
published, RouterOS will try to establish an MQTT connection with the specified broker first and then publish the message. If set to "no",
RouterOS will not be able to send the message, unless the connection is already established beforehand ("connected=yes").
```
```
message (st
ring;
Default: )
```
```
The message that you wish to publish to the broker.
```
```
qos (integer:
0..
4294967295
; Default: 0 )
```
```
Quality of service parameter, as defined by the broker.
```
```
retain (yes |
no; Default:
no)
```
```
Whether to retain the message or to discard it if no one is subscribed to the topic. This parameter is defined by the broker.
```
```
topic (string;
Default: )
```
```
Topic, as defined by the broker.
```
An example of publishing the message:
```
/iot mqtt publish message="test-message" broker="broker" topic="my/test/topic"
```
Subscribe
This menu is used to subscribe to MQTT topics from the broker.
```
Property Description
```
```
Please remember that if you have an on-going connection with the broker (the connection is in the "connected=yes" status) and you subscribe
to the topic via that broker, you have to re-establish the connection!
```
```
broker (string
; Default: )
```
```
Select the broker, where to subscribe to.
```
```
force (yes |
no; Default:
yes)
```
```
If set to "yes", when the connection with the broker is not yet established ("connected=no"), and subscription is attempted, RouterOS will
try to establish an MQTT connection with the specified broker first and then subscribe to the topic. If set to "no", RouterOS will not be
able to subscribe to the topic, unless the connection is already established beforehand ("connected=yes").
```
```
qos (integer:
0..
4294967295
; Default: 0 )
```
```
Quality of service parameter, as defined by the broker.
```
```
topic (string;
Default: )
```
```
Topic, as defined by the broker, where to subscribe to.
```
An example of a subscription:
```
/iot mqtt subscribe broker="broker" topic="my/test/topic"
```
Wildcard (single level "+" and multi-level "#") subscriptions are also supported (RouterOS does not allow publishing to wildcard topics but allows subscribing
to them):
```
/iot mqtt subscribe broker="broker" topic="my/test/#"
/iot mqtt subscribe broker="broker" topic="my/test/+"
```
This means that if you subscribe to topic="my/test/#", you will be able to receive messages published to any topic that begins with the pattern before
the wildcard symbol "#" (e.g., "my/test/topic", "my/test/topic/something").
And, if you subscribe to topic="my/test/+", you will be able to receive messages published on the topic +1 level (e.g., "my/test/topic", "my/test
/something").
Subscriptions
This section is used to manage already-added subscriptions (that were previously added via the Subscribe section).
It has the same properties as the Subscribe section.
```
Property Description
```
```
on-message (string; Default: ) Configure a script that will be automatically initiated/run whenever a new message is received in the subscribed topic.
```
To check already subscribed topics, issue the command:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions print
0 broker=broker topic="my/test/topic" qos=0
```
After you publish a test message as shown in the Publish section above:
```
/iot mqtt publish message="test-message" broker="broker" topic="my/test/topic"
```
You should be able to check the received message under:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions recv print
0 broker=broker topic="my/test/topic" data="test-message" time=2023-05-22 16:57:00
```
```
Starting with v7.12beta9, this menu allows you to add the "on-message" setting to your subscriptions.
```

### 1.

### 2.

### 3.
To clear stored messages, issue the command:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions recv clear
```
To run a script (for example, a basic "log" script) whenever any new message appears in the subscribed topic, you can use the on-message feature:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions set on-message={:log info "Got data {$msgData} from topic {$msgTopic}"} broker=broker 0
```
The script can use $msgData and $msgTopic variables. $msgData defines the MQTT message that was published and $msgTopic defines the MQTT
topic, where the message was published. Both variables are automatically generated when a new message appears.
After you publish a new MQTT message to the subscribed topic, a new log entry should appear:
```
/log print
10:19:15 script,info Got data {test-message} from topic {my/test/topic}
```
A second example shows how to run a script whenever a specific message (keywords from the message) appears. To achieve a scenario, where we want
to run a script only when the MQTT message has specific content or a keyword, we can utilize the if condition statement:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions set 0 on-messag={:if ($msgData~"\\{\"test\":\"123\"\\}") do={:log info "Got data
{$msgData} from topic {$msgTopic}"}}
```
Or:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions set 0 on-messag={:if ($msgData~"test") do={:log info "Got data {$msgData} from topic
{$msgTopic}"}}
```
As a result, on every received MQTT message, the script will check whether the if condition is true. If it is true (if $msgData contains the JSON string {"test":
"123"} or if $msgData contains the string "test"), the log entry will be generated. Otherwise, nothing will happen.
Meaning, the script will be run only when you publish a message like this:
```
/iot mqtt publish broker=broker topic="my/test/topic" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
When you receive a message from a topic that falls under multiple subscriptions with on-message configuration, only x1 on-message script will be run.
RouterOS will choose which on-meesage script to run using the following logic/priority:
```
If the topic configured for the subscription is an exact match →  first priority;
If the topic name is not an exact match (wildcard is used) → the second priority is for single 1v1 wildcard topics;
If the topic does not fall under the single 1v1 wildcard category → the third priority is for multi-level wildcard topics based on the topic level.
```
An example:
```
Received message list is limited to 1024 entries. After which, older entries will get overwritten with the new ones.
```
```
$msgData and $msgTopic variables will not work when used in the "System>Script" section created scripts, meaning, they will not
work inside "/iot mqtt subscriptions set on-message={/system script run x}" added scripts. Both variables will work only when they are
used inside the "on-message={}" written script, like, for example, "on-message={:log info "Got data {$msgData} from topic
{$msgTopic}"}".
The same applies to global variable usage. If there are global variables that are "generated" using other scripts (variables that appear
under System>Script>Environment section), they will not work inside the "on-message" script.
```
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions print
0 broker=broker topic="some/sort/of/topic" qos=0 on-message="/system script run script1"
```
```
1 broker=broker topic="some/#" qos=0 on-message="/system script run script2"
```
```
2 broker=broker topic="some/sort/of/+" qos=0 on-message="/system script run script3"
```
```
3 broker=broker topic="some/thing/#" qos=0 on-message="/system script run script4"
```
When you publish the data to some/sort/of/topic, script1 will be initiated → because the topic is an exact match.
When you publish the data to some/sort/of/thing, scrtip3 will be initiated → because it falls under the single 1v1 wildcard topic name.
When you publish the data to some/name, script2 will be initiated →  because it falls under the multi-level wildcard topic name.
When you publish the data to some/thing/else, script 4 will be initiated → because it falls under the multi-level wildcard topic name (even though it is
also matched by some/# wildcard, it is a level closer to some/thing/# entry).
Unsubscribe
```
Property Description
```
```
broker (string; Default: ) Select the broker to unsubscribe from.
```
```
topic (string; Default: ) Select a topic, as defined by the broker, to unsubscribe from.
```
An example of unsubscribing from the broker and the topic is shown below:
```
/iot mqtt unsubscribe broker="broker" topic="my/test/topic"
```
Publishing RouterOS statistics using scripts
You can also use scripts to structure MQTT messages that contain RouterOS statistics. Then, you can apply the scheduler to run the script whenever you
like.
For example, you can run a script like this (copy the content of the RouterOS code shown below into a new terminal and press "enter"):
```
/system script add dont-require-permissions=no name=mqttpublish owner=admin policy=\
ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="#\

The script collects the data from the RouterOS (model name, serial number, RouterOS version, current CPU, used memory, free memory, and uptime) and
publishes the message (the data) to the broker in the JSON format:
```
/system script run mqttpublish
[*] Gathering system info...
[*] Total message size: 125 bytes
[*] Sending message to MQTT broker...
```
```
[*] Done
```
You can subscribe to the topic to check the results:
```
/iot mqtt subscriptions recv print
0 broker=broker topic="my/test/topic" data="{"model":"RB924i-2nD-BT5&BG77","sn":"E9C80EAEXXXX","ros":"7.9","

Do not forget to change the "Configuration" part of the script (topic and the broker) based on your settings.


# Kaa IoT setup

## Introduction
MQTT and HTTP are among the most popular protocols that are used for transferring all kinds of data. Both protocols are heavily utilized in different IoT
setups, and they both are supported by RouterOS.
What kind of data, you might ask? Pretty much anything... RouterOS scripting is a very powerful tool that can help you automate your devices with the help
of scheduling.
For example, you can check your system's resource information with the help of the command /system resource print :
```
/system resource print
uptime: 4d1h37m55s
version: 7.14.3 (stable)
build-time: 2024-04-17 12:47:58
factory-software: 6.45.9
free-memory: 926.0MiB
total-memory: 1024.0MiB
cpu: ARM
cpu-count: 4
cpu-frequency: 533MHz
cpu-load: 0%
free-hdd-space: 88.5MiB
total-hdd-space: 128.0MiB
write-sect-since-reboot: 1107
write-sect-total: 1447413
bad-blocks: 0%
architecture-name: arm
board-name: RB1100AHx4
platform: MikroTik
```
This command shows you useful information, like CPU usage, RAM-memory usage, device's uptime and its firmware version. Another command will print
out GPS coordination (if the device has a GPS chip built-in) and so on...
What this means, essentially, is that anything that can be "printed out" into the RouterOS terminal, can be scripted to be structured into JSON format
messages and send out with a configured interval. We will showcase a more detailed example later on in the guide.
In other words, you are able to send the data from your MikroTik to any MQTT or HTTP server of your choice. Kaa IoT is one of such servers.
Why Kaa IoT?

## Kaa IoT configuration
Make sure to check KAA: Connecting your first device.
After you log into the portal, to start, follow the steps from the playbook:
a) Create an application, under "Home>Device management>Applications", by clicking on the "Add application" button, name it, and "Create" it:
b) Create a device, under "Home>Device management>Devices", by clicking on the "Add device" button, name it, and "Create" it:
Input your own "Endpoint token" or let the system auto-generate one for you. Make sure to "save" it (because you will not be able to access it again).
All that is left is to connect our router to the server using MQTT or HTTP, post some data and customize our first dashboard to easier visualize it.
RouterOS configuration
First thing first, the device should have internet access. Check our First Time Configuration guide.
Once you have internet up and running, if you are planning to use MQTT protocol, make sure you have iot package installed. You can download it from our
download page, under the "Extra packages" file (for your device's respective architecture). Unzip the "Extra packages" file and upload iot package to the "Fil
es" (reboot the device after that). If you are planning on only using HTTP posting, there is no need for iot package installation.
Before going further, visit Kaa IoT MQTT and HTTP device API guides.
Using HTTP to post the data
To post a basic JSON message:
```
{"test":"data"}
```
Simply run the command:
```
/tool fetch url="https://next.kaaiot.com/kpc/kp1/<app-version>/epmx/<token>/update/keys" http-method=post http-
header-field="Content-Type: application/json" http-data="{\"test\":\"data\"}" output=user mode=https
```
, where you should change <app-version> (that you can check under the "Home>Devices management>Devices>Specific device" tab) and <token>
(that you've generated after creating a device on the platform) to your respective values.
You should be able to see that a new "Metadata" value appeared under "Home>Device management>Devices>Specific device>Overview" tab or check
logs under "Home>Device management>Devices>Specific device>Data logs" tab.
To collect /system resource print information and post it, we can use scripting. Copy and paste the content of the script show below into the
command line:
```
/system script
add dont-require-permissions=no name=systeminfo owner=admin policy=\
ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="#####################\
############### System ###################################\r\

\n:local freeMemory [/system resource get free-memory];\r\
\n:local usedMemory ([/system resource get total-memory] - \$freeMemory);\r\
\n:local rosVersion [/system package get value-name=version \\\r\
\n[/system package find where name ~ \"^routeros\"]];\r\

}
```
Using MQTT to post the data
In order to use a one-way SSL MQTT scenario, get the root certificate from "Home>Device management>Credentials" by clicking on the "Get root
certificate" button. More info can be found here.
Upload ca.pem certificate file to the RouterOS and import it using:
```
/certificate/import file-name=ca.pem passphrase=""
```
Add a new MQTT broker:
```
/iot mqtt brokers
add address=mqtt.next.kaaiot.com name=kaaiot port=8883 ssl=yes
```
Connect to the broker and check whether the connection is ongoing with the help of the "print" command ("connected=yes" should be present):
```
/iot mqtt connect broker=kaaiot
```
```
/iot mqtt brokers print
0 name="kaaiot" address="mqtt.next.kaaiot.com" port=8883 ssl=yes auto-connect=no keep-alive=60 parallel-scripts-
limit=off connected=yes
```
To post a basic JSON message:
```
{"test":"data"}
```
Simply run the command:
```
/iot mqtt publish broker=kaaiot message="{\"test\":\"data\"}" topic="kp1/<app-version>/epmx/<token>/update/keys
/88"
```
, where you should change <app-version> (that you can check under the "Home>Devices management>Devices>Specific device" tab) and <token>
(that you've generated after creating a device on the platform) to your respective values.
You should be able to see that a new "Metadata" value appeared under "Home>Device management>Devices>Specific device>Overview" tab or check
logs under "Home>Device management>Devices>Specific device>Data logs" tab.
To collect /system resource print information and post it, we can use scripting. Copy and paste the content of the script show below into the
command line:
```
/system script

Data visualization using dashboards
To visualize previously posted data, go to "Home>Solutions>Your_Solution>Dashboards>Your_Dasboard" and click on "Add widget":
Select a widget type (we will use "Device management"), and a pre-set widget (we will use "Endpoint metadata").
"Edit" the widget and choose your "Endpoint ID" under "Data source>Endpoint ID". From here, you can customize the dashboard further:
And so! you can create your own scripts that collect information that is important to you instead, and then just apply a scheduler to run the script with an
interval of your choice. Maybe you want to collect GPS coordinates from your LTAP and visualize them using the "map" widget? It is only up to you!

## Introduction
One of the many cloud services that you can use to monitor information that is sent by an MQTT publisher is Thingsboard. This article will demonstrate
how to configure both Thingsboard and RouterOS to publish the data using the MQTT protocol. RouterOS, in this scenario, is going to act as a gateway
and publish the data from the RouterBoard to the Thingsboard's server. Thingsboard, in this scenario, will act as an MQTT broker (server, where data will
be posted).
Before we proceed with the settings, you need to either:
```
a) Create an account in the Thingsboard's system. You can do so by following this link. This will allow you to use the ThingsBoard cloud solution
for free for a limited/test time period.
b) Set up your own server by following the guides. There is a community edition that can be installed and used free of charge.
```

## Thingsboard configuration
Access the login page via your browser and log in. Go to the "Devices" menu.
Create a new device by clicking on the add button "+" and "Add new device":
Enter the name of the device and click on "Add":
```
Please consider using SSL MQTT (TCP port 8883 and certificates), instead of non-SSL MQTT (TCP port 1883). If you use non-SSL MQTT, the
communication between the client (MQTT publisher) and the server (MQTT broker) can be easily sniffed/packet captured, and that will
compromise authentication data (such as client-ids, usernames and passwords).
```
```
In this guide, we will showcase local instance/server installation configuration, but the same principles apply to the cloud option.
```
By default, access token authentication is selected for the newly created device.
Access token scenario
You can change the token by clicking on the created device and entering the "Manage Credentials" settings (in the "Details" section):
This token will be used as a "username" for the MQTT publisher (in RouterOS settings).
You can find more information by following the link.
MQTT Basic scenario
You can change the credentials type in the "Device Credentials" section for the specific device:
MQTT Basic scenario allows you to specify the Client ID, Username, and Password for the MQTT authentication.
You can find more information by following the link.
One-way SSL communication scenario
The configuration will be the same as shown in the Access token and MQTT Basic scenarios shown above. So choose either one.
The only difference, in this case, is the communication between the device and the server (you will only have to slightly change MQTT broker configuration
in RouterOS settings which will be shown later on).
When using this scenario, the communication is going to be encrypted (using SSL).
X.509 (two-way SSL communication) scenario
You can change the credentials type in the "Device Credentials" section for the specific device:
```
Recommended scenario to use!
```
```
This type of authentication requires you to use a server certificate for SSL communication. A server certificate must be generated and uploaded
to the ThingsBoard instance.
```
```
To generate a server certificate, use this guide as a reference → generate the certificate (for example, using OPENSSL tool), install/upload it
into the correct folder, and enable MQTT SSL in the ThingsBoard configuration file.
```
```
This type of authentication requires you to use a server certificate and a client certificate for SSL communication. A server certificate must be
generated and uploaded to the ThingsBoard instance.
```
```
To generate a server certificate, use this guide as a reference → generate the certificate (for example, using OPENSSL tool), install/upload it
into the correct folder, and enable MQTT SSL in the ThingsBoard configuration file.
```
```
To generate a client certificate, use this guide as a reference.
```
X.509 scenario uses a client certificate for authentication.
Once the certificate is generated (for example, using OPEN SSL), copy the RSA public key into the field and click on the "Save" button.
RouterOS configuration
note: In order to configure MQTT, make sure that iot package is installed beforehand.
MQTT Broker
Access token scenario
Add an MQTT broker as shown below:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=1883 username=access_token
```
```
Change the "address" to the actual IP/domain address of your ThingsBoard server;
Change the "username" to the access token that you've used in the ThingsBoard settings.
```
MQTT Basic scenario
Add an MQTT broker as shown below:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x client-id=clientid password=password username=username
```
```
Change "address" to the actual IP/domain address of your ThingsBoard server;
Change the "username", "password" and "client-id" to the actual values that you've used in the ThingsBoard settings.
```
One-way SSL communication scenario
In this scenario, RouterOS needs to have a server certificate imported into its system.
Drag-and-drop server certificate, that was installed into the ThingsBoard, into the router's "File List" menu:
```
Recommended scenario to use!
```
Import server certificate:
```
/certificate/import file-name=mqttserver.pem passphrase=""
```
When using SSL one-way communication and an access token scenario, add an MQTT broker as shown below:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=8883 username=access_token ssl=yes
```
```
Change the "address" to the actual IP/domain address of your ThingsBoard server;
Change the "username" to the access token that you've used in the ThingsBoard settings;
Make sure to use "port=8883" (the MQTT SSL port that the server is listening to);
Make sure to enable "ssl=yes".
```
When using SSL one-way communication and an MQTT Basic scenario, add an MQTT broker as shown below:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=8883 client-id=clientid password=password username=username
ssl=yes
```
```
Change the "address" to the actual IP/domain address of your ThingsBoard server;
Change the "username", "password" and "client-id" to the actual values that you've used in the ThingsBoard settings;
Make sure to use "port=8883" (the MQTT SSL port that the server is listening to);
Make sure to enable "ssl=yes".
```
X.509 (two-way SSL communication) scenario
Drag-and-drop the certificates into the router's "Files/File List" menu →  server certificate, client certificate, and its private key.
Import certificates one by one:
```
/certificate/import file-name=mqttserver.pem passphrase=""
/certificate/import file-name=cert.pem passphrase=""
/certificate/import file-name=key.pem passphrase=""
```
Add an MQTT broker as shown below:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=x.x.x.x port=8883 certificate=cert.pem_0 ssl=yes
```
```
Change the "address" to the actual IP/domain address of your ThingsBoard server;
Change the "certificate" selected to the actual client certificate name that you've imported;
Make sure to use "port=8883" (the MQTT SSL port that the server is listening to);
Make sure to enable "ssl=yes".
```
MQTT Publish
a) A quick MQTT publish test with a static value:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="tb" topic="v1/devices/me/telemetry" message="{\"cpu\":\"7\"}"
```
b) In order to publish relevant data from the RouterOS to the Thingsboard, you can use the script shown below as a reference. The script collects the data
from the RouterOS device (model name, serial number, RouterOS version, current CPU, used memory, free memory, and uptime) and publishes the
message (the data) to the broker in the JSON format:
```
# Required packages: iot
```
```
################################ Configuration ################################
# Name of an existing MQTT broker that should be used for publishing
:local broker "tb"
```
```
# MQTT topic where the message should be published

```
```

```
```
:log info "$message";
:put ("[*] Total message size: $[:len $message] bytes")
:put ("[*] Sending message to MQTT broker...")
/iot mqtt publish broker=$broker topic=$topic message=$message
:put ("[*] Done")
```
2 script lines should be taken into account.
```
:local broker "tb"
```
line, where you should specify the broker's name within the quotation marks "".
```
:local topic "v1/devices/me/telemetry"
```
line, where you should specify the correct topic within the quotation marks "" (check Thingsboard's documentation for the exact topic that needs to be
used).
The rest of the script configuration depends on the overall requirements.
Copy and paste the above script into a notepad, and re-copy it again. Navigate to System>Scripts menu, add a new script there, and paste the script that
is shown above. Name it, for example, script1.
To run the script, you can use the command line:
```
/system script run script1
```
Verification
You can check the received/published data for the device under the "Latest telemetry" section:

## Summary
Sub-menu: /disk
This menu will list all attached storage devices, presuming that they are supported and in working condition. This is especially useful for RouterBOARD
devices with SD/CF/USB/SATA/NVMe slots and x86 systems with additional dedicated storage drives - as the built-in storage is quite small, an external
drive comes in very handy when you want a big User Manager database, proxy cache or possibly SMB shares on your router.
You can add as many external or secondary drives as you want, and select any number of them for each of the mentioned feature usages. For example,
User Manager could be used on 3 disks, one of them would be the active database, and the rest would be backups. You can then add a fourth disk, copy
the active data to it - unmount - unplug it - and move to another server, to keep using the actual database. This means migration and backup are made
easy!
Disks carry names where they are physically connected.

DEVICE
```
```
The "B - BLOCK-DEVICE"- Flag means that this device works using blocks for input/output operations. In the context of RouterOS, its
distinction is crucial, as it helps determine whether a device is functioning as a data carrier or simply providing information about the disk
layout structure. This difference becomes important when considering the extender with the device behind it. If a device is marked with the
letter "B", this indicates its ability to be used as storage or memory. In contrast, devices that do not have a "B" mark are designed primarily
to understand the structure of the disk.
```
```
This allows to quickly recognize the presence of a PCIe or SAS expander, as well as detect the presence of drives in the first expander. In
addition, it allows you to estimate the speed of the connection to which each device is connected.
```
```
However, the most notable benefit of the "B" flag is its ability to instantly indicate whether a device can be formatted or used for RAID
purposes.
```

```
Notes
```
```
With "auto-smb-sharing=yes" and "/ip smb share enabled=auto" SMB server gets enabled when a storage device is physically plugged in
```
Let us presume that you have added a storage device to your device that is running RouterOS. System will try to automatically mount it and in such case if
storage is formatted in a supported file-system and partition record, it will be found in "/files" menu moments after you plugged it in to the host device.
If not, here is what you have to do.
1. Do a quick print of disk menu, to make sure that router sees the attached storage.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > disk print
Flags: B - BLOCK-DEVICE; M, F - FORMATTING
Columns: SLOT, MODEL, SERIAL, INTERFACE, SIZE, FREE, FS
# SLOT MODEL SERIAL INTERFACE SIZE FREE FS

```
We can here see that system sees one storage drive and also that it is formatted with a known file-system type.
When running file menu print-out we also see that is mounted.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > file print
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME

2 pub directory feb/04/1970 21:31:40
```
2. To formatting drive - we issue command with previously know id or name(slot) and with desired file-system (ext4 or fat32), we can also assign label to
device as I did in this example and make mbr partition table
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk format-drive usb1 file-system=ext4 label=usb-flash mbr-partition-table=yes
formatted: 100%
```
If multiple GPT partitions are needed format drive without partition table and add them manually:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk format-drive usb1 file-system=ext4 label=usb-flash mbr-partition-table=no
formatted: 100%
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk add type=partition parent=usb1 partition-size=200M
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk add type=partition parent=usb1 partition-size=500M
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk add type=partition parent=usb1 slot=usb1-last-partition
```
Web-Proxy cache configuration example
Enter proxy cache path under IP -> Proxy menu and web proxy store is automatically created in files menu. If a non-existent directory path is used, an
additional sub-directory is also created automatically.
```
Note: In printout, you can see that there is a progress percentage counter in formatting process. For larger storage drives, it might take longer
for this process to finish, so be patient.
```
```
Note: Slot (partition or disk name) is assumed automatically, but can be overwritten by using slot parameter.
If partition size is not used all available space will be used from last partition.
To offset partition start "partition-offset" parameter can be used.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ip proxy set cache-path=usb1/cache-n-db/proxy/

Log on disk configuration example
When configuring logging on disk make sure that you create directories in which you want to store the log files manually, as non-existent directories will
NOT be automatically created in this case.
```

```
Allocate RAM to folder
It is possible to add folders linked to RAM. Folders will be emptied on reboot or power loss.
RAM will be filled up to tmpfs-max-size and if this variable in not provided - up to 1/2 from available RAM.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /disk add type=tmpfs tmpfs-max-size=100M
[admin@MikroTik] > file print

```
Test disk performance
Starting from 7.16 to run disk performance tests. Disks has to be disabled or without mountable file system (unformatted).
Check available disks, if disk is already mounted - disable it.
```
Note: Logging topics such as firewall, web-proxy and some other topics that tend to save a large amount or rapid printing of logs on system
NAND disk might cause it to wear out faster, so using some attached storage or remote logging is recommended in this case or save data in
RAM folder
```
```
Disk performance tests may slowly degrade disk health
```
```
On write tests all files and file systems on disks will be destroyed

Introduction
Shielded RJ45 Port vs Unshielded RJ45 Port

```

## Introduction
Shielded cable installation infrastructure (towers and masts), as well as antennas and the router itself, must be properly grounded. Lightning arresters must
be installed on all external antenna cables (near the antennas or on the antennas themselves) to prevent equipment damage and human injury. Note that
lightning arresters will not be effective if they are not properly grounded.
Use 1 AWG (7 mm in diameter) wire with corrosion-resistant connectors for grounding. Ensure that the grounding infrastructure you use is fully functional
(not merely decorative, as seen in some installations).
```
For shielded connectors, please use shielded cables as they provide better immunity.
The grounding wire should be connected to the RouterBOARD grounding wire attachment point if such is provided. This wire should then be
connected to the base of the tower, ensuring the connection meets grounding standards. The antenna's grounding wire should be connected near
the RouterBOARD outdoor case and can be joined with the same grounding wire used for the RouterBOARD.
```

## Summary
RouterBOARD 2011U and CCR series devices are equipped with a resistive touchscreen, for quick access to device stats and simple configuration
options. Touchscreen requires pressure against the surface to register a touch, therefore light swipes and quick/short taps might not get registered (as
opposed to a capacitive touchscreen commonly found on phones). If you find trouble operating the screen with your finger, you can also try a stylus, or
opposite end of a pen.

## LCD Touchscreen Calibration
Before the LCD touchscreen can be used, it needs to be calibrated at least once. After the first successful calibration, data is stored on the router. If no
calibration values are present, calibration process will start automatically.
During the calibration/recalibration you must touch 4 points drawn on the screen. Three of the points are used to calculate calibration variables and the 4th
point is used to test whether the calibration was successful. If calibration is unsuccessful, calibration variables are not saved. At the end (after touching 4th
point) a message is displayed with the calibration result.
Take LCD Screenshot
Take-screenshot function allows to create BMP image of currently displayed LCD screen and saves it in File List with specified name. Screenshots without
file name are not saved, screenshots with an existing file name are overwritten.

LCD screens/modes
Since v6.0, LCD has a menu structure. Menu screens consist of buttons that are used to navigate the menus. A scrollbar is shown on the right side of the
screen if it does not fit on the actual display. The screen can be dragged up or down to access more options if they are available. At the top of each menu
screen is a "Back" button that jumps to the previous screen.
Startup
If the router has default configuration - user named "admin" with no password, then a warning on LCD will appear. This screen shows IP's assigned to the
interfaces which could be used to connect to the router. Otherwise the Main menu screen is displayed after booting up.
Interfaces
Interfaces menu displays all the Ethernet and Wireless interfaces. Bandwidth usage is shown similar to the All interface graph screen. From the Interfaces
screen you can choose a specific interface to look at. The following options are available:
```
Info (only for physical interfaces) - menu which shows information about the interface;
Registration Table (only for wireless) - menu which shows all the registered clients for the wireless interface and their respective signal strengths;
Addresses - menu which lists all the addresses assigned to the interface;
Stats - menu which allows to jump to the selected interface in the "Stats" screen. You can directly choose to show Bandwidth or Packets.
```
```
Info Registration Table Addresses Stats selection
```
Stats
Stats screen shows single interface graphs for RX and TX. Values are updated from right to left (newest to oldest). Info that is shown: RX/TX rate and
packets.
Interface name is shown at the top right, it is trimmed if it's too long (last characters are cut off). The top right corner shows the time interval for the values.
Following time values are available:
```
Min (Minute) - shows values for the last minute. Unit = second. Vertical line separates first 30 seconds. Total values: 30 + 24;
Hour - shows values for the last hours. Unit = 5 minutes. Vertical lines separate 1 hour. Total values: 12 + 12 + 3;
Daily - shows values for the last days. Unit = hour. Vertical lines separate 1 day. Total values: 12 + 12 + 3;
Weekly - shows values for the last weeks. Unit = day. Vertical lines separate 1 week. Total values: 7 + 7 + 4;
```
Motions:
```
Tap - tapping the finger against the touch screen without moving it too much.
If a tap lands into the top right corner of the screen (square box 1/4 of the screen height), info time interval is changed: Min -> Hour ->
Daily -> Weekly -> Min...
Otherwise a tap cycles through graph info: rate -> packets -> rate...
Swipe/Drag - while holding the finger down, move in any direction. The changes should be highlighted during the drag.
Up - Go to Main menu
Down - Select All Interface graph screen
Left - Next interface
Right - Previous interface
```
All Interface Graph Screen
All interface graph screen shows the RX/TX bandwidth usage about all interfaces. The max values are calculated like this - for Ethernet interfaces it's the
negotiated rate or set speed. For wireless interfaces it's calculated from used band, channel-width and chain count using the theoretical values. The goal of
this screen is to see how values are related to each other for a single interface.
Motions:
```
Swipe/drag.
Up - Back (to Stats screen).
Left - Next page.
Right - Previous page.
```
Stat Slideshow
Stat Slideshow screen is similar to the "Stats" screen, but the interfaces are switched after they timeout. Settings for slideshow are stored in RouterOS

## Introduction
It is the sole responsibility of administrators to configure the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) such that intended services and applications can be
successfully implemented in the network. In other words - administrators must make sure that MTUs are configured in a way that packet sizes do not
exceed the capabilities of network equipment.
Originally MTU was introduced because of the high error rates and low speed of communications. Fragmentation of the data stream gives the ability to
correct corruption errors only by resending corrupted fragments, not the whole stream. Also on low-speed connections such as modems, it can take too
much time to send a big fragment, so in this case, communication is possible only with smaller fragments.
But in the present day we have much lower error rates and higher speed of communication, this opens a possibility to increase the value of MTU. By
increasing the value of MTU we will result in less protocol overhead and reduce CPU utilization mostly due to interrupt reduction. This way some non-
standard frames started to emerge:
```
Giant or Jumbo frames - frames that are bigger than standard (IEEE) Ethernet MTU;
Baby Giant or Baby Jumbo frames - frames that are just slightly bigger than standard (IEEE) Ethernet MTU;
```
It is common now for Ethernet interfaces to support physical MTU above standard, but this can not be taken for granted. Abilities of other network
equipment must be taken into account as well - for example, if 2 routers with Ethernet interfaces supporting physical MTU 1526 are connected through an
Ethernet switch, in order to successfully implement some application that will produce these big Ethernet frames, the switch must also support forwarding
such frames.

## Maximum Transmission Unit
```
Mikrotik RouterOS recognizes several
types of MTU:
```
```
IP/Layer-3/L3 MTU
MPLS/Layer-2.5/L2.5 MTU
MAC/Layer-2/L2 MTU
Full frame MTU
```

## Full frame MTU
Full frame MTU indicates the actual size of the frame that is sent by a particular interface. Frame Checksum is not included as it is removed by an ethernet
driver as soon as it reaches its destination.
MAC/Layer-2/L2 MTU
L2MTU indicates the maximum size of the frame without the MAC header that can be sent by this interface.
In RouterOS L2MTU values can be seen in the "/interface" menu. L2MTU support is added for all Routerboard related Ethernet interfaces, VLANs, Bridge,
VPLS, and wireless interfaces. Some of them support the configuration of the L2MTU value. All other Ethernet interfaces might indicate L2MTU only if the
chipset is the same as Routerboard Ethernets.
This will allow users to check if the desired setup is possible. Users will be able to utilize additional bytes for VLAN and MPLS tags, or simply increase
interface MTU to get rid of some unnecessary fragmentation.
This table shows max-l2mtu supported by Mikrotik RouterBoards (available in the "/interface print" menu as the value of the read-only "max-l2mtu" option):

All wireless interfaces in RouterOS (including Nstreme2) support 2290 byte L2MTU.
MPLS/Layer-2.5/L2.5 MTU
Configured in the "/mpls interface" menu, specifies the maximal size of the packet, including MPLS labels, that is allowed to send out by the particular
interface.
Make sure that MPLS MTU is smaller or equal to L2MTU. MPLS MTU affects packets depending on what action the MPLS router is performing. It is
strongly recommended that MPLS MTU is configured to the same value on all routers forming the MPLS cloud because of the effects MPLS MTU has on
MPLS switched packets. This requirement means that all interfaces participating in the MPLS cloud must be configured to the smallest MPLS MTU values
among participating interfaces, therefore care must be taken to properly select the hardware to be used.
You can read more about MPLS MTU here.
MPLS Switching
If the packet with labels included is bigger than MPLS MTU, MPLS tries to guess the protocol that is carried inside the MPLS frame:
```
L2MTU configuration changes evoke all interface reloads (link down/link up) due to necessary internal processes.
It is recommended to configure L2MTU with caution by keeping in mind that it can cause short interruption with connected devices.
```
```
If this is an IP packet, MPLS produces an ICMP Need Fragment error. This behavior mimics IP protocol behavior. Note that this ICMP error is not
routed back to the originator of a packet but is switched towards the end of LSP so that the egress router can route it back.
If this is not an IP packet, MPLS simply drops it, because it does not know how to interpret the contents of the packet. This feature is very
important in situations where MPLS applications such as VPLS are used (where frames that are MPLS tagged are not IP packets, but e.g.
encapsulated Ethernet frames as in the case of VPLS) - if somewhere along the LSP MPLS MTU will be less than packet size prepared by
ingress router, frames will simply get dropped.
```
IP ingress
When a router first introduces a label (or labels) on an IP packet, and the resulting packet size including MPLS labels exceeds MPLS MTU, the router
behaves as if interface MTU was exceeded - either fragment packet in fragments that do not exceed MPLS MTU when labels are attached (if IP Don't
Fragment is not set) or generate ICMP Need Fragmentation error that is sent back to the originator.
VPLS ingress
When the router encapsulates the Ethernet frame for forwarding over VPLS pseudowire, it checks if packet size with VPLS Control Word (4 bytes) and any
necessary labels (usually 2 labels - 8 bytes), exceeds MPLS MTU of the outgoing interface. If it does, VPLS fragments packets so that it honors the MPLS
MTU of the outgoing interface. A packet is defragmented at the egress point of the VPLS pseudowire.
Setup Examples
In these examples, we will take a look at frames entering and leaving the router via Ethernet interfaces.
Simple Routing
The image shows the packet MTU size for simple routing, packets size is not modified.
Routing with VLAN Encap
Each VLAN tag is 4 bytes long, the VLAN tag is added by a router. L2-MTU is increased by 4 bytes.
Simple MPLS with Tags
When MPLS is used as a plain replacement for IP routing, only one label is attached to every packet, therefore packet size increases by 4 bytes, we have
the situation with two MPLS labels. In order to be able to forward standard size (1500 bytes) IP packets without fragmentation, MPLS MTU must be set to
at least 1508 for two MPLS labels.
VPLS Tunnel
Two MPLS labels are present when a remote endpoint is not directly attached. One MPLS label is used to get to a remote endpoint, the second label is
used to identify the VPLS tunnel.
Advanced Setup Examples
In this example, we will take a closer look at the required L2MTU of all Ethernet-like interfaces including Bridge, VLAN, and VPLS interfaces.
In this setup we will have 3 routers:
```
Q-in-Q router - this router will receive a standard 1500 byte Ethernet frame and will add two VLAN tags to the packet. Then packet will be sent out
via an Ethernet network to the second router
```
```
VPLS router - this router will remove the outer VLAN tag and will bridge the packet with the remaining VLAN tag with the VPLS tunnel. VPLS
tunnel will take a packet through the MPLS network to the third router.
```
```
MPLS Edge router - will remove VPLS and VLAN tags and bridge packet to the client Ethernet network.
```

This article describes supported add-on peripherals for RouterBOARD hardware devices.

## Cellular modems
RouterOS v7 supported cellular modems:
```
MikroTik modems
3rd party modems supported by device class/type:
MBIM class USB interface
USB-CDC class USB interface
RNDIS type USB interface
3rd party modem with added support, see modem table below
```
Please note:
```
not all modems are listed in the supported modem table, some may work because modem manufacturers re-use the same hardware IDs and vice
versa
customized, localized and locked units may have compatibility issues
3rd party modem may require a modem configuration adjustment before it can be used with RouterOS
mini-PCIe modems with USB3.0 interface installed in mini-PCIe PCIe/USB2.0 enabled slot USB speed must be limited to USB2.0 speed or mini-
PCIe shared PCIe/USB3.0 pins isolated. See the picture below table

## Summary
This page explains using the PoE-Out (Power over Ethernet) feature available on MikroTik devices equipped with at least one PoE-Out interface. MikroTik
devices utilize an RJ45 mode B pinout for power delivery, with PoE supplied through pins 4 and 5 (+) and pins 7 and 8 (-).

## MikroTik supported PoE-Out standards
MikroTik devices can support some or all of the following PoE standards:
```
When powering other devices via PoE-Out, it is recommended to use a minimum input voltage of 18V, unless the device supports multiple
output voltages (e.g., CRS112-8P-4S-IN, CRS328-24P-4S+RM, CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM).
```
```
Passive PoE-Out up to 30 V - PoE standard, which does not require negotiation between PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment) and PD (Powered
Device). PoE-out uses the same voltage as supplied to the PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment). PoE-Out Standard for devices that supports input
voltage up to 30 V. (e.g. hEX PoE lite, RB3011UiAS-RM, RB2011iL-IN.)
```
```
Passive PoE-Out up to 57 V - Works the same as low voltage (up to 30 V) PoE-Out, but is also capable to deliver high voltage over PoE ports.
The output voltage depends on the power source connected to PSE. Can power up af/at compatible devices, which accepts power over 4,5 (+)
and 7,8 (-), and does not require PoE negotiation. (e.g. cAP ac, hAP ac, wsAP ac lite.)
```
```
IEEE Standards 802.3af/at - Also known as PoE+ Type 1 (af) and PoE+ Type 2 (at), these IEEE standards aim to ensure compatibility between
vendors. MikroTik PSEs that support these standards can power both Type 1 and Type 2 PDs. MikroTik devices that support af/at standard can
also power devices that accept Passive PoE-In. (e.g. CRS112-8P-4S-IN, CRS328-24P-4S+RM, CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM.)
```
```
IEEE Standards 802.3bt -  The 802.3bt standard, also known as PoE++, extends the earlier PoE standards and introduces "Type 3" (Classes 5-6)
and "Type 4" (Classes 7-8). This standard uses all four pairs of wires in Gigabit Ethernet cable to deliver power, hence the name of the standard -
4PPoE/802.3bt ("4-pair Power over Ethernet"). 802.3bt powering is isolated from PoE-Out and the device powering itself. (e.g CRS320-8P-8B-
4S+RM)
```
Each PoE-Out implementation supports overload and short-circuit detection.

PoE-Out Configuration
PoE Configuration is supported on all MikroTik devices with PoE-Out interfaces, the configurations can be edited from the RouterOS and SwOS interfaces.
RouterOS
Sub-menu: interface ethernet poe
Usage
RouterOS provides an option to configure PoE-Out over Winbox, Webfig, and CLI, basic commands using the CLI are
```
Property Description
```
```
print () Prints PoE-Out related settings.
```
```
export () export is displayed under /interface ethernet menu.
```
```
monitor (string| interface) Shows poe-out-status of a specified port, or all ports with /interface ethernet poe monitor [find]
command.
```
```
power-cycle (duration:0..1m |; Default:
5s)
```
```
Disables PoE-Out power for a specified period of time.
```
Global Settings
Sub-menu : /interface ethernet poe settings
Some MikroTik PoE-Out devices support the global PoE settings
```
Property Description
```
```
ether1-
poe-in-
long-cable
(yes | no)
```
```
Setting it to "yes" will disable short detection on all poe-out ports. This is potentially dangerous settings and should be used with
caution.  This feature disables strict input/output current monitoring (short detection) to allow the use of PoE-Out with long ethernet
cables and/or avoiding improper short-circuit detection. It can also affect PoE-Out behavior on PSE which is powered using a DC
connector
```
```
psuX-
max-
power
```
```
Specifies the maximum power in watts that the PSU can draw.  default - 96W
```
```
psu1 - RB5009UPr+S+IN  = DC-jack  | RB5009UPr+S+OUT - 2-PIN
```
```
psu2 - RB5009UPr+S+IN  = 2-PIN terminal | RB5009UPr+S+OUT - not available
```
```
This command is designed specifically for RB5009UPr+S+ to ensure the safety and optimal performance of the Power Supply Unit
(PSU). It allows users to set the maximum power limit for the PSU, preventing potential overload that could compromise the stability and
longevity of the system.
```
Port Settings
PoE-Out can be configured under the menu. Each port can be controlled independently.
```
Property Description
```
```
name () Name of an interface
```
```
poe-out (auto-on |
forced-on | off; Default: a
uto-on)
```
```
Specifies PoE-Out state
```
```
auto-on - the board will attempt to detect if power can be applied to the port. For powering there should be resistance
in the range from 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ
forced-on - detection range is removed. As a result power over Ethernet will be always on
off - all detection and power is turned off for this port
```
```
poe-priority (integer:0..
99 | any; Default:  10 )
```
```
poe-priority specifies the importance of PoE-Out ports, in cases when a total PoE-Out limit is reached, interface with the
lowest port priority will be powered off first.
Highest priority is 0, the lowest priority is 99. If there are 2 or more ports with the same priority then port with the smallest
port number will have a higher priority.
Every 6 seconds ports will be checked for a possibility to provide PoE-Out if it was turned off due to port priority.
```
```
poe-voltage (auto | low |
high; Default: auto)
```
```
A feature that allows us to manually switch between two voltage outputs on PoE-Out ports. It will take effect only on PSE
with switchable voltage modes (CRS112-8P-4S-IN, CRS328-24P-4S+RM, netPower 16P, CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM).
```
```
poe-lldp-enabled ( yes /
no; Default: no)
```
```
Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a layer-2 Ethernet protocol for managing devices. LLDP allows an exchange of
information between a PSE and a PD.
```
```
Starting from RouterOS version 7.15, the setting has been replaced with the Neighbor Discovery lldp-poe-power
property.
```
Power-cycle settings
RouterOS provides a possibility to monitor PD using a ping, and power-cycle a PoE-Out port when the host does not respond. power-cycle-ping feature
can be enabled under /interface ethernet poe menu.
```
Property Description
```
```
power-cycle-
ping-enabled (
yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Enables ping watchdog, power-cycles port if a host does not respond to ICMP or MAC-Telnet packets.
```
```
power-cycle-
ping-address (I
Pv4 | IPv6 |
MAC; Default:
)
```
```
An address which will be monitored. Since RouterOS 6.46beta16, an active route towards PD is required in case an IP address is
configured, so make sure PSE can reach the PD. In case the MAC address is specified, PSE will send MAC-Telnet ping requests
only from a specified ethernet interface. When configuring a bridge vlan-filtering or some way of VLAN switching, it is recommended
to use the IP address for monitoring your PD.
```
```
power-cycle-
ping-timeout (ti
me:0..1h |;
Default: 5s)
```
```
If the host does not respond for more than <timeout> period of time, then PoE-Out port is switched off for 5s.
```
```
power-cycle-
interval (time|
any; Default: )
```
```
Disables PoE-Out power for 5s between the specified intervals. Not related with the power-cycle-ping feature.
```
If power-cycle is enabled, /interface ethernet poe monitor will show the actual status of the host and time when power cycle will be performed [1]
SwOS
SwOS interface provides basic PoE-Out configuration and monitoring options, see more details in the SwOS PoE user manual.
PoE-Out Monitoring
RouterOS
MikroTik devices with PoE-Out controller (not injector) provides port monitoring option. /interface ethernet poe monitor [find]
```
Property Description
```
```

```
```
poe-out () Shows PoE-Out settings
```
```
poe-out-
status ()
```
```
Shows current PoE-Out status on port
```
```
powered-on - Power is applied to the port, and PoE-Out is operating normally,
waiting-for-load - PSE attempts to detect if power can be applied to the port. For powering there should be resistance in the range
from 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ;
short-circuit - Short-circuit is detected on PoE-Out port, power is switched off, the only detection with low voltage takes place. This
can also mean that PoE is not supported on the connected device.
overload - The PoE-Out current limit is exceeded, power is switched off on PoE-Out port. For port limits see each model
specifications.
voltage-too-low - PD can not be powered with the voltage provided from PSE.
voltage_too_high - PSE controller cannot power PD with high voltage;
current-too-low - current-too-low means that PD draws too low current  (<10mA) than normal PoE-Out device should, the reason
for this can be:
```
```
The delivered voltage at PD is too low for normal powering (for example Vmin =>30V, but provided 24V);
```
```
PD uses a second power source which has a higher voltage than PSE, so all current is taken from the second DC source, not PSE PoE-
Out port;
```
```
off - all detection and power is turned off for this port;
power_reset - PSE controller resetting the power, for example, when executing the power cycle command or when pings fail
(power-cycle-ping);
controller_init - PSE controller initialization;
controller_upgrade - PSE controller is being upgraded;
controller_error - PSE controller does not respond.
```
```
poe-out-

```
```
Displays PoE Voltage which is applied to the PD.
```
```
poe-out-

```
```
Displays port current (mA) which is drawn by the PD.
```
```
poe-out-

```
```
Displays PD power consumption
```
If power-cycle-ping feature is used, /interface ethernet poe monitor [find] will show additional fields:
SNMP
It is possible to monitor PoE-Out values using SNMP protocol, this requires enabled SNMP on PSE. SNMP Wiki
SNMP OID tables:
```
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.1 - interface-id
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.2 - interface names
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.4 - voltage in dV (decivolt)
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.5 - current in mA
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.6 - power usage in dW (deviwatt)
```
SNMP values can be requested also from the RouterOS, for example, snmp-walk will print current mA from all available PoE-Out ports:
To get very specific OID value, use snmp-get tool (displays current mA on ether3 interface):
PoE-Out notifications
PoE-Out LEDs
Models with dependant voltage output
PoE-Out LED behavior can differ between models, but most of them will indicate PoE-Out state on one additional LED. Devices with one voltage output
will light:
```
Red color LED - PoE-Out port state is powered-on (auto or forced-on mode).
Blinking Red color LED - PoE-Out port state is short-circuit
```
Models with selectable voltage output
```
power-cycle-host-alive: <YES/NO> (Shows if monitored host is reachable)
power-cycle-after:<TIME> (Shows time, after which the port will be power-cycled)
```
```
/tool snmp-walk address=10.155.149.252 oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.5

```
tool snmp-get address=10.155.149.252 oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.15.1.1.5.3
```
Models with multiple voltage options can indicate additional information:
```

CRS112-8P-4S-IN - All PoE LEDs flashing: wrong voltage PSU plugged into one of the ports.
netPower 16P - All PoE LEDs flashing: wrong voltage PSU plugged into one of the ports.
CRS328-24P-4S+RM - indicates an exceeded overall max PoE output limit. Port PoE-Out priorities will work in 3 independent sections (8 ports
each) and overload will happen in any section that breaches 150W consumption.
CRS320-8P-8B-4S+RM - Purple color triangle LED - PoE-Out port state is powered-on (auto or forced-on mode), PD uses high voltage (802.3bt).
Blinking Purple color triangle LED - PoE-Out port state (802.3bt high voltage) is short-circuit or overload
```
PoE-Out Logs
By default PoE-Out, event logging is enabled and uses "warning" and "info" topics to notify the user about PoE-Out state changes. Log entries will be
added to each PoE-Out state change. Important logs will be added with a "warning" topic, informative logs will be added with the "info" topic.  When PoE
LLDP is enabled, LLDP status updates are available in the device logs, for example:
Possible denial reasons:
To avoid unnecessary logging in cases when PD is not powered because of current-too-low, RouterOS will filter such events, and add one log per every
512 current-too-low events.
Logs can be disabled if necessary:
PoE-Out Warnings in GUI/CLI
To notify a user about important PoE-Out related problems, messages will be shown in Winbox / WebFig and CLI interface fields:
WebFig and Winbox will notify user under interfaces:
```
06:56:50 poe-out,debug ether4 LLDP TLV 25.0W request denied : hw-limit
```
```
budget - requested power exceeds the total PSE budget.
hw-limit - requested power is more than hardware supports (PSU affects this).
low-voltage - LLDP request made to low-voltage port.
off - port is shut down.
class-limit - LLDP requires more than the class can provide.
cmd-failed - RouterOS could not make a request to the controller.

How it works
PoE-Out Modes
auto-on mode
If auto-on is selected on PoE-Out interface, then port operates in this strict order:
```
PSE with low voltage checks for resistance on the connected port. If the detected resistance range is between (3kΩ to 26.5kΩ) power is turned on;
When power is applied, the PSE continuously checks if the overload limit is not reached or short circuit detected
If the cable is unplugged, the port returns in detection state and will remain off until suitable PD is detected
```
forced-on mode
If forced-on is selected then port operates in this strict order:
```
PSE disables resistance check on the port, and apply power on pins 4,5 (+) and 7,8 (-), even if no cable is attached
When power is applied, PSE still continuously checks if an overload or short circuit is not detected
After the cable is unplugged, the power still remains enabled on the port.
```
off mode
If off mode is used, PoE-Out on the port will be turned off, no detection will take place, and the interface will behave like a simple Ethernet port.
PoE-Out limitations
It is important to check PoE-Out specification to find out hardware limitations because it can differ between models
PoE-Out port limitation
PoE-Out ports are limited with max amp values which are supported in particular voltage, usually max current will differ for low voltage devices (up to 30
V), and for high voltage devices (31 to 57 V).
PoE-Out total limitation
PSE has also a total PoE-Out current limitation which can't be exceeded, even if the individual port limit allows it.
PoE Out polarity
All MikroTik PSE uses the same PoE-Out pin polarity Mode B4,5 (+) and 7,8 (-), however other vendors can use opposite or Mode A pinout on PD.
Reverse polarity would require using a crossover cable but Mode A PD would require Mode B to Mode A converter.
Safety
PSE has the following safety features:
PoE-Out compatibility detection
The auto-on mode is considered safe, it will check if the resistance on the port is within allowed range and only then enable PoE out on the interface. The
range is 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ
Overload protection
When a PoE-Out port is powered-on, it is constantly checked for overload. If the overload is detected, PoE-Out is turned off on the port to avoid damage to
the PD or PSE.
In seconds the PoE Out feature will be turned on again to see if the environment has changed and PD can be supplied with power again. That is important
for configurations that are not connected to mains (solar installations, equipment running on batteries due to mains failure) so that when voltage drops -
overload will be detected and connected devices turned off. After a while when the voltage level returns to usual operating value - connected equipment
can be powered up again.
Short circuit detection
When power is enabled on PoE-Out port, PSE continuously checks for a short circuit. If it is detected to ensure that there is no additional damage to PD
and PSE, the power is turned off on all ports. PSE will continue to check PoE-Out port until the environment returns to normal.
Model-specific features
PSE with independent 8-port sections (CRS112-8P-4S-IN, CRS328-24P-4S+RM, netPower 16P, CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM) allows PoE-Out to work
independently from the RouterOS, this means that you can reboot/upgrade your RouterOS and the PD will not be rebooted.
PoE Out examples
RouterOS allows us to define priorities on PoE-Out ports, so if your installation is going overpower budget, the PSE will disable less important PD with the
lowest priority.
The priority of  0  is the highest priority,  99  - lowest
Setting up priority
Example of how to set priorities from CLI:
```
Note: Passive PD with high input inrush current can result in overcurrent protection on PSE, make sure that PD specification supports powering
from PSE (not only from the passive power injector)
```
```
Warning: Make sure that non-standard incompatible PD which does not have the resistance range 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ are not attached, so the PSE
would not try to apply power on them
```
```
Note: CRS328-24P-4S+, netPower 16P Poe-Out priorities work independently on each 8 port section!
```
```
/interface ethernet poe set ether2 poe-priority=10
/interface ethernet poe set ether3 poe-priority=13
/interface ethernet poe set ether4 poe-priority=11
/interface ethernet poe set ether5 poe-priority=14
```
What will happen when power budget will go over total PoE-Out limit - first if the overload is detected, ether5 will be turned off (lowest priority), then
recheck is done and if the still total limit overload is detected next port in priority will be turned off, in this example, ether3 will be turned off. Both of these
ports will be reached every few seconds to check if it is possible to turn PoE-Out on for these ports. Power up will happen in reverse order as the power
was cut.
Same priority
if all, or some ports will have the same poe-priority, then port with the lowest port number will have higher priority
In this example, if the total PoE-Out limit is reached ether5 will be turned off first, then ether4 then ether3 as all of these ports have same poe priority.
Monitoring PoE-Out
PoE-Out ports can be monitored using a command /interface ethernet poe monitor <interface>
Power-cycle ping
Monitor connected PD with power-cycle-ping feature:
In this example, PD attached to ether1 will be continuously monitored using a power-cycle-ping feature, which will send ICMP ping requests and wait for a
reply. If PD with IP address 192.168.88.10 will not respond for more than 30s, the PoE-Out port will be switched off for 5s.
Troubleshooting
In cases where a PD does not power-up or reboots unexpectedly when powered from your PSE, it's suggested to the first check:
```
PD supported input voltage - PSE output voltage must be in the range supported by the PD. Otherwise, the PD is incompatible with the PSE, and
will not be able to power-up. Check the PD datasheet.
PD supported input PoE-in standard - Some PDs do not support af/at standard even if it has PoE-in support up to 57 V, check PD datasheet.
PD is rebooted from PSE
Check if PD does not exceed PoE-Out port limit and Total-PoE-Out port limit of the PSE, check PSE datasheet.
Check if the Voltage limit does not drop bellow supported (Can be caused by voltage drop on the wires).
Check if you are using a proper power supply, the output power of PSU should be calculated from:
(MAX power consumption of PSE) + (MAX power consumption of all PD) + 10%)
```
```
Check if you are using good quality ethernet cables, it's important especially in cases if PoE is used.
Check RouterOS version - it's possible, that some PoE related features will be updated with RouterOS, make sure that you are running the latest
RouterOS version.
```
```
/interface ethernet poe set ether2 poe-priority=10
/interface ethernet poe set ether3 poe-priority=10
/interface ethernet poe set ether4 poe-priority=10
/interface ethernet poe set ether5 poe-priority=10
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > interface ethernet poe monitor [find]
name: ether2 ether3 ether4 ether5
poe-out-voltage: 23.2V 23.2V 23.2V
poe-out-current: 224mA 116mA 64mA
poe-out-power: 5.1W 2.6W 1.4W
```
```
/interface ethernet poe set ether1 power-cycle-ping-enabled=yes power-cycle-ping-address=192.168.88.10 power-cycle-ping-timeout=30s
```
```
PD Does not power up
There can be cases where a PD does not power up, even though it supports passive PoE, and does not consume more power than the
specified PSE port limit. This can be caused by inrush current triggering overcurrent protection on the PSE. Make sure that PD
specification supports powering from PSE (not only from passive power injector)
Polarity - Devices with opposite or different pinouts can be unable to powerup from all PSE. Check the PD datasheet.
Incompatible resistance - PD resistance should have ranged from 3kΩ to 26.5kΩ (For Passive-PoE) and from 23.75kΩ to 26.25kΩ on af
/at.
```
Legacy
PoE-Out Controller upgrade
PoE-Out devices which are running RouterOS 5.x can also hold old PoE-Out controller firmware, upgrade to RouterOS 6.x will automatically update the
PoE-Out firmware. Changes between 1.x and 2.x PoE-Out controller firmware will result in higher Max-port limits (0.5A to 1A) in case if it's supported by
the hardware, also will provide some additional data which can be monitored, and allow to use PoE-Out priorities.
All MikroTik devices which come with RouterOS 6.x already support the latest PoE-Out firmware.


# Ports

Summary
General
Properties
Remote Access
Properties
```

## Summary
There are many ways how to use ports on the routers. Most obvious one is to use serial port for initial RouterOS configuration after installation (by default
serial0 is used by serial-terminal).
Serial and USB ports can also be used to:
```
connect 3G modems;
connect to another device through a serial cable
access device connected to serial cable remotely.
```

## General
Sub-menu: /port
Menu lists all available serial and USB ports on the router and allows to configure port parameters, like baud-rate, flow-control, etc.
Below you can see default port configuration on LtAP.
```
[admin@LtAP] > /port/print
Columns: DEVICE, NAME, CHANNELS, USED-BY, BAUD-RATE
# DEVICE NAME CHANNELS USED-BY BAUD-RATE

# Product Naming
```
Introduction
RouterBOARD products naming details
Board Name
Board Features
Built-in wireless details
Enclosure type
Example
CloudCoreRouter naming details
CloudRouterSwitch and CloudSmartSwitch naming details
```

## Introduction
MikroTik product naming can be confusing at first glance, but all the product codes have a logical explanation and follow a code.

## RouterBOARD products naming details
RouterBOARD (short version RB)
<board name> <board features>-<built-in wireless> <wireless card features>-<connector type>-<enclosure type>

## Board Name
Currently, there can be three types of board names:
```
3-symbol name
1st symbol stands for series (this can either be a number or a letter); New additions: D - Dakota; C - Cypress; S - Chateau; L - Maple;
2nd digit for indicating the number of potential wired interfaces (Ethernet, SFP, SFP+)
3rd digit for indicating the number of potential wireless interfaces (built-in and mPCI and mPCIe slots)
```
```
Word - currently used names are: OmniTIK, Groove, SXT, SEXTANT, Metal, LHG, DynaDish, cAP, wAP, LDF, DISC, mANTBox, QRT, DynaDish,
cAP, hAP, hEX. If the board has fundamental changes in hardware (such as completely different CPU) revision version will be added at the end
```
```
Exceptional naming - 600, 800, 1000, 1100, 1200, 2011, 3011, 4011 boards are standalone representatives of the series or have more than 9
wired interfaces, so the name was simplified to full hundreds or development year.

been manually uploaded to the router. In either case, the newest found version will be shown here.
```

## Upgrading RouterBOOT
RouterBOOT upgrades usually include minor improvements to overall RouterBOARD operation. It is recommended to keep this version upgraded. If you
see that the upgrade-firmware value is bigger than current firmware, you simply need to perform the upgrade command, accept it with y and then reboot
with /system reboot
```
[admin@mikrotik] /system routerboard> upgrade
Do you really want to upgrade firmware? [y/n]
y
echo: system,info,critical Firmware upgraded successfully, please reboot for changes to take effect!
```

reboot
```
```
baud-rate (integer;
Default:  115200 )
```
```
Choose the onboard RS232 speed in bits per second (if installed)
```
```
boot-delay (time;
Default: 2 s)
```
```
How much time does to wait for a keystroke while booting
```
boot-device (nand-if-
fail-then-ethernet ...;
Default: nand-if-fail-
then-ethernet)
```
Choose the way RouterBOOT loads the operating system:
```
```
ethernet - boot the device in Etherboot mode;
flash-boot - Flashfig mode on startup is enabled. This setting will revert to NAND after a successful configuration
change OR once any user logs into the board.
flash-boot-once-then-nand - Flashfig mode on startup is enabled for a single boot only, resets to nand-if-fail-then-
ethernet after that.
nand-if-fail-then-ethernet - boot RouterOS from the NAND, if RouterOS is not booting - it goes to Etherboot
automatically. This is the default mode for devices straight out of the box;
nand-only - boot RouterOS from the NAND;
try-ethernet-once-then-nand - boot device in Etherboot mode once and if no server is available - it will boot directly
from the NAND or of the storage type the device is using.
```
boot-os (router-os
|swos; Default: router-
os)
```
Changes the booting operating system for CRS3xx series switches
```
boot-protocol (bootp
|dhcp ...; Default: bootp)
```
Boot protocol to use:
```
```
bootp - the default option for booting RouterOS
dhcp - used for OpenWRT and possibly other OS
```
cpu-frequency (depend
s on model; Default: de
pends on model)
```
This option allows for changing the CPU frequency of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options,
hit the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in RouterOS version 7 on the keyboard at this prompt
```
cpu-mode (power-save
| regular; Default: power
-save)
```
Whether to enter CPU suspend mode in HTL instruction. Most OSs use HLT instruction during the CPU idle cycle. When
the CPU is in suspend mode, it consumes less power, but in low-temperature conditions, it is recommended to choose a
regular mode, so that the overall system temperature would be higher
```
enable-jumper-reset (ye
s | no; Default: yes)
```
Disable this to avoid accidental setting reset via the onboard jumper
```
enter-setup-on (any-
key | delete-key;
Default: delete-key)
```
Which key will cause the BIOS to enter configuration mode during boot delay. Useful when the serial console prints out
symbols during the boot process and goes into RouterBOOT menu by itself. Note that in some serial terminal programs, it
is impossible to use the Delete key to enter the setup - in this case, it might be possible to do this with the Backspace key
```
force-backup-booter (ye
s | no; Default: no)
```
If to use the backup RouterBOOT. This is only useful if the main loader has become corrupted somehow and cannot be
fixed. So that you don't have to boot the device with a pushed reset button (which loads the backup loader), you can use
this setting to load it every time
```
```
yes - backup loader will be used always
no - main booter will be used
```
init-delay (timeout
interval 0s..9s; Default: )
```
Used for mPCIe modems with RB9xx series devices only
```
```
In case your modem is not being recognized after a soft reboot, then you might need to add a delay before the USB port is
initialized
```
```
Note
```
```
Etherboot mode is a special state for a MikroTik device that allows you to reinstall your device using Netinstall.
```
```
There are several ways to put your device into Etherboot mode depending on the device you are using:
```
1. Press the Reset button and power on your device (wait until "USR" led is blinking then stable "On" and when
the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in bootp mode to reinstall RouterOS
using Netinstall.
2. Using the serial console, when the device is booting up, keep pressing CTRL+E on your keyboard until the
device shows that it is trying bootp protocol
3. Using the serial console, press any key while the device is booting and choose "o" then "1" and "x"
```
memory-frequency (dep
ends on model; Default:
depends on model)
```
```
This option allows changing the memory frequency of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options,
hit the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in RouterOS version 7 button on the keyboard at this prompt
```
```
memory-data-rate (dep
ends on the model;
Default: depends on
model)
```
```
This option allows changing the memory data rate of the device. Values depend on the model, to see available options, hit
the [?] button in RouterOS version 6 or the [F1] button in RouterOS version 7 button on the keyboard at this prompt
```
```
preboot-etherboot (time
out interval 1s..30s;
Default: disabled)
```
```
Enables preboot etherboot, which runs before the regular boot device. It works the same as boot-device=etherboot, but
has an additional timeout value. If an IP address is not received from the Netinstall server before the timeout expires, the
regular booting process will start.
```
```
preboot-etherboot-
server (IP address, any:
Default: any)
```
```
Sets preboot-etherboot to accept IP address only from the specified Netinstall server IP address. By enabling this feature,
unintentional etherboot from other BOOTP/DHCP servers can be prevented.
```
```
regulatory-domain-ce (y
es | no; Default: no)
```
```
Enables extra-low TX power for high antenna gain devices (requires a reboot)
```
```
silent-boot (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
This option disables output on the serial console and beeping sounds during booting, to avoid the text output interrupting a
connected device. Useful if you have some temperature monitor or modem connected to the serial port
```
```
yes - no output on the serial console and no booting beeps (does not disable the RouterOS: beep command)
no - regular info and options menu on a serial console
```
Preboot etherboot
preboot-etherboot is a feature that instructs RouterOS device to search for a Netinstall server on every boot for specified amount of time, before starting
the regular booting process (e.g., RouterOS). This feature is particularly useful for remote reinstall, as it allows the device to attempt etherboot on every
startup.
preboot-etherboot-server specifies that the preboot-etherboot booter should look only for a Netinstall server with a specific IP address. Since by default,
etherboot accepts address from any BOOTP/DHCP server,  with this feature, you can specify to accept the address only from a particular Netinstall server,
meaning that the device can be reinstalled without removing it from the network.
With both features enabled, any device can be reinstalled remotely without accessing RouterOS or holding the reset button. One example of starting a
remote reinstall process would be to simply power cycle RouterOS device from a PoE switch or another power controller. After installation, disable your
Netinstall server and simply power cycle the installed device.
To enable preboot-etherboot and preboot-etherboot-server:
1) Install RouterOS version 7.9+
2) Upgrade RouterBOOT with "/system routerboard upgrade"
3) Reboot
The feature can be set with command:
```
Note
```
```
The preboot-etherboot configuration is stored in the BIOS, downgrading RouterOS to older versions will not
disable it. This feature can be disabled from the RouterOS menu or by resetting the BIOS.
```
```
Since etherboot accepts IP addresses from any BOOTP/DHCP server, use preboot-etherboot-server to start
etherboot only when address is received from specified Netinstall server.
```
```
If the CPU or memory is overclocked and that is the reason why the router is not performing as suspected, then this is not considered a
warranty case and you should return both frequencies to a nominal value.
```
```
system/routerboard/settings/set preboot-etherboot=9s preboot-etherboot-server=10.155.115.199
```
On every next reboot/power cycle, this device will try to receive IP address from Netinstall server with IP 10.155.115.199, for 9 seconds. If there will be no
such server, regular boot process will start.
Protected bootloader
The feature allows the protection of RouterOS configuration and files from a physical attacker by disabling etherboot. It is called "Protected RouterBOOT".
This feature can be enabled and disabled only from within RouterOS after login, i.e., there is no RouterBOOT setting to enable/disable this feature. These
extra options appear only under certain conditions. When this setting is enabled - both the reset button and the reset pin-hole are disabled. RouterBOOT
menu is also disabled. The only ability to change boot mode or enable the RouterBOOT settings menu is through RouterOS. If you do not know the
RouterOS password - only a complete format is possible.
A special package is provided to upgrade the backup RouterBOOT (DANGEROUS). Newer devices will have this new backup loader already installed at
the factory. If your RouterOS is v7, your factory-firmware version is lower than 7.6 and your device displays the message → The "protected routerboot"
feature requires a backup-routerboot upgrade ← when trying to enable the feature, do the following:
a) upgrade or downgrade the device specifically to the 7.6 release (from our download page or archive).
b) upgrade your current RouterBOOT version with "/system routerboard upgrade" then reboot the device, so that the RouterBOOT version (current-
firmware version when checking "/system routerboard print") is the same as the firmware version ("/system resource print") installed, which should be 7.6.
c) drag and drop the v7 universal package for all architectures into the device's file system then reboot the device again. This will make your factory-
firmware version 7.6, where you are allowed to enable the feature. After this step, you can upgrade the device to a newer release.
If your RouterOS version is v6 and you get the same prompt, follow the same steps mentioned above, but only update/downgrade/compare your device
version to specifically 6.49.7 instead and use v6 universal package for all architectures.
For example, when setting protected-routeboard enabled, you will be given 60 seconds to confirm by pressing the reset button, otherwise, this setting won't
be enabled.
```
[admin@450] > system/routerboard/settings/set protected-routerboot=enabled
[admin@450] > system/routerboard/settings/print
;;; press button within 60 seconds to confirm
protected routerboot enable

force-backup-booter: no
silent-boot: yes
protected-routerboot: enabled
reformat-hold-button: 20s
reformat-hold-button-max: 10m
```
```
Property Description
```
```
In case if the preboot-etherboot is set to boot from any IP (preboot-etherboot-server is not specified), the device will enter etherboot mode from
any Netinstall/DHCP server-provided IP address and will wait for the reinstall process. Also, note that RouterOS reinstall does not affect BIOS
settings, and preboot-etherboot would still be enabled and would try to enter etherboot. To avoid this scenario without accessing RouterOS,
simply disable any attached Netinstall/DHCP server.
```
```
Starting from the v7 version, when enabling or making any changes to the protected-routerboard feature the reset or mode button must be
pressed for confirmation.
```

```
protected-
routerboot (e
nabled |
disabled;
Default: disa
bled)
```
```
This setting disables any access to the RouterBOOT configuration settings over a console cable and disables the operation of the
reset button to change the boot mode (Netinstall will be disabled). Access to RouterOS will only be possible with a known RouterOS
admin password. Unsetting of this option is only possible from RouterOS. If you forget the RouterOS password, the only option is to
perform a complete reformat of both NAND and RAM with the following method, but you have to know the reset button hold time in
seconds.
```
```
enabled - secure mode, only RouterOS can be accessed with a RouterOS admin password. Any user input from the serial port
is ignored. Etherboot is not available, RouterBOOT setting change is not possible.
disabled - regular operation, RouterBOOT settings available with serial console and reset button can be used to launch Netinstall
```
```
reformat-
hold-button (
5s .. 300s;
Default: 20s)
```
```
As an emergency recovery option, it is possible to reset everything by pressing the button at power-on for longer than reformat-hold-
button time, but less than reformat-hold-button-max (new in RouterBOOT 3.38.3).
When you use the button for a complete reset, the following actions are taken:
```
```
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Use this only if you have lost all access to the device.
```
```
RouterOS, all of its files and configuration is completely and irreversibly erased by nand re-format;
All RouterBOOT settings are reset to defaults;
Board is rebooted;
As boot from NAND fails, it goes to etherboot automatically;
Netinstall is required to reinstall RouterOS.
```
```
Please note! Reformat on some RouterBOARDS can take more than 5 minutes. After formatting the board will be ready for Netinstall.
```
```
reformat-
hold-button-
max (15s ..
600s;
Default: 10m)
```
```
Increase the security even further by setting the max hold time, this means that you must release the reset button within a specified
time interval. If you set the "reformat-hold-button" to 60s and "reformat-hold-button-max" to 65s, it will mean that you must hold the
button 60 to 65 seconds, not less and not more, making guesses impossible. Introduced in RouterBOOT 3.38.3
```
Mode and Reset buttons
Reset button additional functionality is supported by all MikroTik devices running RouterOS
Some RouterBOARD devices have a mode button that allows you to run any script when the button it pushed.
The list of supported devices:
```

```
```
hold-time (time interval Min..Max;
Default: )
```
```
HoldTime:= Button functionality can be called if a button is pressed for a certain period of time:
Min..Max: Min -- 0s..1m (time interval), Max -- 0s..1m (time interval) (available only starting from RouterOS
6.47beta60)
```
```
on-event (string; Default: ) Name of the script that will be run upon pressing the button. The script must be defined and named in the "
/system scripts" menu
```
Example for mode button:
```
/system script add name=test-mode-button source={:log info message=("mode button pressed");}
/system routerboard mode-button set on-event=test-mode-button enabled=yes
```
```
Upon pressing the button, the message"mode button pressed" will be logged in the system log.
```
Examples for RouterOS version newer than 6.47:
```
/system script add name=test-mode-button source={:log info message=("mode button pressed");}
/system routerboard mode-button set on-event=test-mode-button hold-time=3..5 enabled=yes
```
The reset button works in the same way, but the menu is moved under the : /system routerboard reset-button:
```
/system script add name=test-reset-button source={:log info message=("reset button pressed");}
/system routerboard reset-button set on-event=test-reset-button hold-time=0..10 enabled=yes
```
LED dark mode control with the mode button:
```
/system script add name=dark-mode source={
:if ([system leds settings get all-leds-off] = "never") do={
/system leds settings set all-leds-off=immediate
} else={
/system leds settings set all-leds-off=never
}
}
/system routerboard mode-button set enabled=yes on-event=dark-mode
```
The C53, S53 and cAP ax series RouterBoards have configurable WPS button. It also works in the same way as reset button and mode button and
executes a script.
```
/system script add name=test-wps-button source={:log info message=("wps button pressed");}
/system routerboard wps-button set on-event=test-wps-button hold-time=0..10 enabled=yes
```
WPS accept control with the WPS button:
```
/system script add name=wps-accept source={
:foreach iface in=[/interface/wifiwave2 find where configuration.mode="ap"] do={
/interface/wifiwave2 wps-push-button $iface
}
}
/system routerboard wps-button set enabled=yes on-event=wps-accept
```
```
Starting from RouterOS 6.47 reset-button functionality and a hold-time option have been added
```


# USB Features

RouterBoard USB Port Limitations
```

## Summary
Sub-menu: /system routerboard usb
Package: system (v6, v7)
This article describes RouterBoard device supported USB features.

## USB Power Reset
USB power reset turns off USB port power for a specified time. It is useful when 3G/LTE modem needs to be restarted but there is no physical access to it.
Available properties:
```
duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off.
```
For example, turn off USB port power for 10 seconds:
```
/system routerboard usb power-reset duration=10s
```
RouterBoards with multiple USB buses also require a bus specified in order to do a USB power reset.
Available properties:
```
duration (time; Default: "3s") - Time interval of how long power is turned off.
bus (integer; Default: 1) - USB bus where power reset is applied.
```

## USB Port Type
RB912UAG and RB953GS have partially shared USB port and miniPCIe slot. Due to hardware restrictions it is possible to use only one at the time for 3G
/LTE modem.
```

USB-type-A mini-PCIe
```
Available properties:
```
type (USB-type-A | mini-PCIe; Default: "USB-type-A") - Type of enabled port.
```
```
RB953GS: The miniPCIe slot closer to Ethernet ports on the RB953GS board is the one which is shared with USB port and has configurable US
B port type, its USB bus number is 1. Depending on USB port type the power reset is done on USB port or miniPCIe slot. The other miniPCIe
slot closer to SFP slots has independent bus - 2.
```
```
RB922UAG: The USB port has an independent bus - 1. The miniPCIe slot has an independent bus - 2.
```
```
CCR1072-1G-8S+: The micro USB port has independent bus - 0. The USB Type-A port has independent bus - 1.
```
USB Port Mode
RB2011 series, CRS1xx series, and mAP have micro USB port which operates in host mode when USB device is attached through USB OTG cable. Some
vendor cables require forced host mode to recognize connected device.
Available properties:

# Bandwidth Test

## Summary
```
Sub-menu: /tool
Packages required: system
```
```
The Bandwidth Tester can be used to measure the throughput to another MikroTik router (either wired or wireless) and thereby help to discover
network "bottlenecks".
```
```
The TCP test uses the standard TCP protocol with acknowledgments and follows the TCP algorithm on how many packets to send according to
latency, dropped packets, and other features in the TCP algorithm. Please review the TCP protocol for details on its internal speed settings and how to
analyze its behavior. Statistics for throughput are calculated using the entire size of the TCP data stream. As acknowledgments are an internal
working of TCP, their size and usage of the link are not included in the throughput statistics. Therefore this statistic is not as reliable as the UDP
statistic when estimating throughput.
```
```
The UDP tester sends 110% or more packets than currently reported as received on the other side of the link. To see the maximum throughput of a
link, the packet size should be set for the maximum MTU allowed by the links which is usually 1500 bytes. There is no acknowledgment required by
UDP; this implementation means that the closest approximation of the throughput can be seen.
```

## Bandwidth Test Server
```
Sub-menu: /tool bandwidth-server
```
```
Property Description
```
```
allocate-udp-ports-from (integer 1000..64000; Default:  2000 ) Beginning of UDP port range
```
```
authenticate (yes | no; Default: yes) Communicate only with authenticated clients
```
```
enabled (yes | no; Default: yes) Defines whether bandwidth server is enabled or not
```
```
max-sessions (integer 1..1000; Default:  100 ) Maximal simultaneous test count
```
```
Example
```
```
Bandwidth Server:
```
```
Up to RouterOS version 6.44beta39 Bandwidth Test used only single CPU core and reached its limits when core was 100%
loaded.
Bandwidth Test uses all available bandwidth (by default) and may impact network usability.
```
```
Bandwidth Test uses a lot of resources. If you want to test real throughput of a router, you should run bandwidth test through the
tested router not from or to it. To do this you need at least 3 routers connected in chain: the Bandwidth Server, the router being
tested and the Bandwidth Client.
```
```
If you use UDP protocol then Bandwidth Test counts IP header+UDP header+UDP data. In case if you use TCP then Bandwidth
Test counts only TCP data (TCP header and IP header are not included).
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> print
enabled: yes
authenticate: yes
allocate-udp-ports-from: 2000
max-sessions: 100
[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server>
```
Active sessions:
```

1 25.25.25.1 udp send admin
2 36.36.36.1 udp send admin
[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server session>
```
To enable bandwidth-test server without client authentication:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> set enabled=yes authenticate=no
[admin@MikroTik] /tool bandwidth-server> print
enabled: yes
authenticate: no

# Detect Internet

## Introduction
Detect Internet is a tool that categorizes monitored interfaces into the following states - Internet, WAN, LAN, unknown, and no-link.

## State
This submenu displays status of all monitored interfaces defined by the detect-interface-list parameter:
```
interface/detect-internet/state/print
```

## LAN
All layer 2 interfaces initially have this state.

## WAN
Any L3 tunnel and LTE interfaces will initially have this state. Layer 2 interfaces can obtain this state if the following conditions are met:
```
an interface has an active route to 8.8.8.8 in main routing table.
an interface can obtain (dynamic DHCP client is created) or has obtained an address from DHCP (does not apply if DHCP server is also running
Detect Internet on the DHCP server interface).
```

## Internet
WAN interfaces that can reach cloud.mikrotik.com using UDP protocol port 30000 can obtain this state. Reachability is checked every minute. If a cloud is
not reached for 3 minutes, the state falls back to WAN.


# Configuration
```
/interface detect-internet
```
```
Property Description
```
```
detect-interface-list (interface list; Default: none) All interfaces in the list will be monitored by Detect Internet
```
```
internet-interface-list (interface list; Default: none) Interfaces with state Internet will be dynamically added to this list
```
```
lan-interface-list (interface list; Default: none) Interfaces with state Lan will be dynamically added to this list
```
```
wan-interface-list (interface list; Default: none) Interfaces with state Wan will be dynamically added to this list
```
```
Note that Detect Internet can install DHCP clients, default routes, DNS servers and affect other facilities.
Use with precaution, and after enabling the service, check how it interferes with your other configuration.
```
```
WAN interface can fall back to LAN state only when link status changes. LAN interfaces get locked to LAN after 1h and then change only when
link status changes.

# Dynamic DNS

## Introduction
```
/tool dns-update
```
Standards: RFC 2136, RFC 3007
Dynamic DNS Update Tool gives a way to keep the domain name pointing to a dynamic IP address. It works by sending a domain name system update
requests to the name server, which has a zone to be updated. Secure DNS updates are also supported.
The DNS update tool supports only one algorithm - hmac-md5. It's the only proposed algorithm for signing DNS messages.

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
address (IP; Default: ) Defines the IP address associated with the domain name.
```
```
dns-server (IP; Default: ) DNS server to send updates to.
```
```
key (string; Default: ) Authorization key to access the server.
```
```
key-name (string; Default: ) Authorization key name (like a username) to access the server.
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Name to attach with the IP address.
```
```
ttl (integer; Default: ) Time to live for the item (in seconds).
```
```
zone (string; Default: ) DNS zone where to update the domain name in.
```

## Example
To tell 23.34.45.56 DNS server to (re)associate mydomain name in the myzone.com zone with 68.42.14.4 IP address specifying that the name of the key
is dns-update-key and the actual key updates:
```
[admin@MikroTik] tool> dns-update dns-server=23.34.45.56 name=mydomain \
\... zone=myzone.com address=68.42.14.4 key-name=dns-update-key key=update
```
```
DNS update tool works only with the BIND server, it will not work with DynDNS, EveryDNS, or any other similar service.
```
```
The system clock time on your router can't differ from the DNS server's time by more than 5 minutes. Otherwise, the DNS server will ignore this
request.
```


# Graphing
Summary
Configuration
General
Interface graphing
Queue graphing
Resource graphing
Graphing in WinBox

## Summary
Graphing is a tool to monitor various RouterOS parameters over time and put collected data in graphs.
Watch our video about this feature.
The Graphing tool can display graphics for:
```
Resource usage (CPU, Memory, and Disk usage)
Traffic which is passed through an interface
Traffic which is passed through a simple queue
```
Graphing consists of two parts - the first part collects information and the other part displays data on a Web page. To access the graphics, type [http://](http://)
[Router_IP_address]/graphs/ and choose a graphic to display in your Web browser.
Alternatively, look for the menu ≡ (triple bar sign) in the top right corner of the WebFig interface, allowing you to find "graphs":
Example of memory graphs:
```
We suggest not storing graphs on disk for devices with small built-in memory.

Sub-menu allows to enable graphing of system resources. Graphing collects data of:
```
CPU usage
Memory usage
Disk usage
```
Sub-menu: /tool graphing resource
```
Property Description
```
```
allow-address (IP/IPv6 prefix; Default: 0.0.0.0/0) IP address range from which is allowed to access graphing information
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Description of current entry
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Defines whether item is used
```
```
store-on-disk (yes | no; Default: yes) Defines whether to store collected information on system drive
```
Graphing in WinBox
Winbox allows viewing the same collected information as on the web page. Open Tools->Graphing window. Double click on the entry of which you want to
see graphs.
The image below shows WinBox graphs of memory usage:
```
If simple queue has target-address set to 0.0.0.0/0 everyone will be able to access queue graphs even if allow address is set to specific
address. This happens because by default queue graphs are accessible also from the target address.

## Summary
Hardware that supports monitoring will display different information about hardware status, like temperature, voltage, current, fan-speed, etc.
Example on CCR1072-1G-8S+ device:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/health/print
Columns: NAME, VALUE, TYPE
# NAME VALUE TYPE
0 power-consumption 50.8 W
1 cpu-temperature 43 C

4 fan3-speed 5800 RPM
5 fan4-speed 5750 RPM
6 board-temperature1 29 C
7 board-temperature2 28 C
8 psu1-voltage 0 V
9 psu2-voltage 12.1 V
10 psu1-current 0 A
11 psu2-current 4.2 A
```
Warning: For feature availability on RouterBOARD products check mikrotik.com
Intensive health monitoring on the CCR2004-16G-2S+PC device (from the console, winbox or SNMP) causes significant CPU load.

## Voltage
Routers that support voltage monitoring will display supplied voltage value. In CLI/Winbox it will display volts. In scripts/API/SNMP this will be dV or value
showed in CLI/Winbox
Note: Routers that have PEXT and PoE power input are calibrated using PEXT, as a result, value showed over PoE can be lower than input voltage due to
additional ethernet protection chains.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > system/health/print
Columns: NAME, VALUE, TYPE
# NAME VALUE TYPE
0 voltage 23.8 V
1 temperature 39 C
```

## Temperature
```
Note: If old revision CRS112, CRS210 and CRS109 devices are powered with PoE - Health will show correct voltage only up to 26.7V. If higher
voltage will be used - Health will show constant 16V.
```
Routers that support temperature monitoring will display temperature reading. In CLI/Winbox it will display degrees Celsius. Using scripts/API/SNMP this
value will be shown in CLI/Winbox multiplied by 10. There are various temperature sensors depending on the device. These sensors may refer to: cpu-
temperature, pcb-temperature, sfp-temperature. Device tested ambient temperature range you can find in specification description at mikrotik.com. Tested
ambient temperature range is temperature in which device can be physically located. It is not the same as temperature which reports system health
monitor!
Fan control and behavior
```
/system health set
```
Using this menu users will be able to control fan behaviour on TILE architecture devices.
Note: Improved FAN stability starting from version 6.45.5.
There are three parameters that may affect fan behaviour: PoE-out consumption, SFP temperature and CPU temperature. As soon as one of the
parameters exceeds the optimal value the, fans are started.
PoE-out consumption
If a device has PoE-out, then the fan RPM will change as described below:
```
PoE-out load RPM % of max FAN speed
```
```
0%..24% FAN speed 0%
```
```
25%..46% FAN speed 25%
```
```
47%..70% FAN speed 50%
```
```
71%..92% FAN speed 75%
```
```
93%.. FAN speed 100%
```
For devices with PWM fans, the speed will linearly increase or decrease from 9..88% (note: below 100W the fan RPM=0)
Limited manual fan-control option
Note: Starting from RouterOS version 7.9 limited manual fan-control options have been added for CRS3xx, CRS5xx and CCR2xxx devices.
Note: Starting from RouterOS version 7.14 limited manual fan-control is available for the CCR1036-8G-2S+-r2, CCR1036-12G-4S-r2 and CCR1016-12S-
1S+-r2 devices.
Fan behavior can be manipulated using the settings section of system health:
/system health settings set
Available properties are described below:
```
Property Description
```
```
fan-full-speed-temp (integer [-273..65]; Def
ault: 65 )
```
```
Sets the temperature value upon which the fan speed will be increased to the maximum possible rpm.
```
```
Reads temperature from CPU, PHY, SWITCH and SFP and adjusts fan speed based on the component
with the highest temperature.
```
```
fan-target-temp (integer [-273..65]; Default:
58 )
```
```
Sets the target temperature for the hottest component. Based on this setting adjusts fan behavior to hold
temperatures in target range.
```
```
fan-min-speed-percent (integer [0..100]; De
fault: depends on FAN controller)
```
```
Sets the minimum percentage of fan speed thus not allowing fans to have a lower rpm than this value.
*NOTE: the default value may vary based on FAN controller chip and/or specific model requirements.
From RouterOS verson 7.14 default value is set to 12, all previous versions have 0.
```
```
fan-control-interval (integer [5..30]; Default:
30 )
```
```
Sets the actual temperature data read interval to get temperature values from CPU, PHY, SWITCH and
SFP.
```
```
*NOTE: THIS SETTING DIRECTLY AFFECTS CPU USAGE
```
Brief description of the fan-control
If at least one of the internal measured (CPU, SFP, Switch, Board etc.) temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will start to spin. The higher the
temperature, the faster the fans will spin. For devices with PWM fans, as the internal measured temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will linearly
increase their RPM to try to keep the temperature at fan-target-temp if possible and will get to their Max RPM when the temperature is equal or exceeds fan
-full-speed-temp.  For devices with DC fans, as the internal measured temperatures exceed fan-target-temp, the fans will start spinning but at a higher
minimum RPM by default. This may result in cooling the device to the point where the fans turn-off completely if fan-min-speed-percent is set to 0%, while
with the default value of 12% fans will never go to a full stop therefore reducing the noise and On/Off peaks that may occur. The temperature then may
slowly increase to fan-target-temp and the fans will turn on again. Currently, there is one exception. The S+RJ10 modules have a temperature threshold of
65C before they trigger the fans. Since it's a higher temperature threshold, the fans will start spinning at a higher initial speed to cool the device. All the
above mentioned functionality is directly related to the fan-control-interval parameter value as it will determine how often FAN controller monitors all sensor
data and triggers changes in fan-control.
Note: All readings are approximate and may not be 100% precise. Their purpose is to ~inform users about possible/upcoming failures.
```
Note: PWM and DC fans react to fan-control differently. While PWM fans will increase/decrease their RPM in a linear way the DC fans have
only few possible speed ratings at which they may operate.

# Interface stats and monitor-traffic
```
Summary
Stats
Monitor traffic
```

## Summary
Every RouterOS interface contains various counters, for example, the number of received and transmitted packets, Fast Path bytes, and link downs.

## Stats
Use the stats or stats-detail commands to print the interface counters. The values starting with "fp" indicates the Fast Path counters. The value "tx-
queue-drop" indicates the number of dropped packets by the interface queue.

# IP Scan
```
Summary
Quick Example
```

## Summary
IP Scan tool allows a user to scan networks based on some network prefix or by setting an interface to listen to. Either way, the tool collects certain data
from the network:
```
address - IP address of network device;
mac-address - MAC address of network device;
time - response time of seen network device when found;
DNS - DNS name of a network device;
SNMP - SNMP name of the device;
NET-BIOS  - NET-BIOS name of device if advertised by the device;
```
When using IP scan tool user must choose what they want to scan for:
```
certain IPv4 prefix - the tool will attempt to scan all the IP addresses or addresses set;
the interface of the router - the tool will attempt to listen to packets that are "passing by" and attempt to compile results when something is found;
```

## Quick Example
In the following example, we will scan the devices on 10.155.126.0/24 network:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool ip-scan address-range=10.155.126.1-10.155.126.255
Columns: ADDRESS, MAC-ADDRESS, TIMe, SNMP
ADDRESS MAC-ADDRESS TIM SNMP

10.155.126.251 2ms
10.155.126.151 E4:8D:8C:49:49:DB 1ms
10.155.126.153 6C:3B:6B:48:0E:8B 1ms 750Gr3
10.155.126.249 CC:2D:E0:8D:01:88 0ms CRS328-24P-4S+
10.155.126.250 B8:69:F4:B3:1B:D2 0ms
10.155.126.252 6C:3B:6B:ED:83:69 0ms
10.155.126.253 6C:3B:6B:ED:81:83 0ms
```
```
There is a possibility to set both but then results may be inconclusive!

## Summary
RouterOS is capable of logging various system events and status information. Logs can be saved in routers memory (RAM), disk, file, sent by email or
even sent to remote syslog server (RFC 3164).
Video: Logging Basics

## Log messages
```
Sub-menu level:
/log
```
All messages stored in routers local memory can be printed from /log menu. Each entry contains time and date when event occurred, topics that this
message belongs to and message itself.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /log> print
jan/02/1970 02:00:09 system,info router rebooted
sep/15 09:54:33 system,info,account user admin logged in from 10.1.101.212 via winbox
sep/15 12:33:18 system,info item added by admin
sep/15 12:34:26 system,info mangle rule added by admin
sep/15 12:34:29 system,info mangle rule moved by admin
sep/15 12:35:34 system,info mangle rule changed by admin
sep/15 12:42:14 system,info,account user admin logged in from 10.1.101.212 via telnet
sep/15 12:42:55 system,info,account user admin logged out from 10.1.101.212 via telnet
01:01:58 firewall,info input: in:ether1 out:(none), src-mac 00:21:29:6d:82:07, proto UDP,
10.1.101.1:520->10.1.101.255:520, len 452
```
If logs are printed at the same date when log entry was added, then only time will be shown. In example above you can see that second message was
added on sep/15 current year (year is not added) and the last message was added today so only the time is displayed.
Print command accepts several parameters that allows to detect new log entries, print only necessary messages and so on.
For example following command will print all log messages where one of the topics is info and will detect new log entries until Ctrl+C is pressed.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /log > print follow where topics~".info"
12:52:24 script,info hello from script
-- Ctrl-C to quit.
```
In this example it will print only the dhcp info messages:
```
[admin@MikroTik] log/print where topics~"dhcp.info"
11:42:32 dhcp,info defconf deassigned 192.168.88.37 for B0:E4:5C:27:EF:F2 Samsung
11:42:32 dhcp,info defconf assigned 192.168.88.37 for B0:E4:5C:27:EF:F2 Samsung
```
If print is in follow mode you can hit 'space' on keyboard to insert separator:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /log > print follow where topics~".info"
12:52:24 script,info hello from script
```
```
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
```
```
-- Ctrl-C to quit.
```

Examples
Logging to file
To log everything to file, add new log action:
```
/system logging action add name=file target=disk disk-file-name=log
```
and then make everything log using this new action:
```
/system logging add action=file
```
You can log only errors there by issuing command:
```
/system logging add topics=error action=file
```
This will log into files log.0.txt and log.1.txt.
You can specify maximum size of file in lines by specifying disk-lines-per-file. <file>.0.txt is active file were new logs are going to be appended and once it
size will reach maximum it will become <file>.1.txt, and new empty <file>.0.txt will be created.
You can log into USB flashes or into MicroSD/CF (on Routerboards) by specifying it's directory name before file name. For example, if you have accessible
usb flash as usb1 directory under /files, you should issue following command:
```
/system logging action add name=usb target=disk disk-file-name=usb1/log
```
```
Logging entries from files will be stored back in the memory after reboot.

# Syslog with Elasticsearch
```
Introduction
Prerequisites
Setup
Elastic
RouterOS
Using Kibana
```

## Introduction
Elasticsearch is a popular NoSQL database that can be used to store a wide range of data, including Syslog data. Alongside with Kibana you can create a
powerful tool to analyze Syslog data from your RouterOS devices. This guide will rely on Elasticsearch integrations and for it to work you need to have a
working Elasticsearch setup. This guide will not cover setup instructions for Elasticsearch and Kibana, but will cover the relevant steps to setup Syslog
data collection and analysis.
There are many possible configurations that can be made with Elasticsearch, but for the sake of this guide we will use the following principle:
```
A RouterOS (10.0.0.1) device sends out NetFlow data to a server (10.0.0.2) running Custom UDP logs
The server (10.0.0.2) running Custom UDP logs integration ingests Syslog data, processes the data and sends it to a Fleet Server (10.0.0.3)
A Fleet Server (10.0.0.3) stores the data in Elasticsearch (10.0.0.4)
Kibana (10.0.0.5) retrieves data from Elasticsearch (10.0.0.4), analyzes it and allows you to search the data
```

## Prerequisites
```
Setup Elasticsearch
```
```
Setup kibana
```
```
Setup Fleet Server
```

## Setup
The setup instructions are divided into two parts: Elastic (configuration regarding Elasticsearch, Kibana and Fleet Server) and RouterOS (configuration that
is relevant to your RouterOS device).
```
This guide will not use Logstash as a part of analyzing Syslog data, it has been replaced by a Fleet Server.
```
```
It is possible to install Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet Server and NetFlow Records integration on the same device.
```
```
Elasticsearch is widely supported on many platforms. It is recommended to setup a cluster of Elasticsearch nodes.
```
```
Kibana can be installed on the same device on which you installed Elasticsearch, but it can also be installed on a separate device for
performance reasons. While it is possible to analyze Syslog data without Kibana, it requires writing your own API requests, Kibana is
very easy to use and has a wide range of features.
```
```
It is possible to setup Fleet Server on the same device on which you installed Elasticsearch and/or Kibana. It is recommended to install
Fleet Server on a different device. Refer to Elasticsearch manual for recommendations on hardware and topology requirements.

Elastic
```
Log into your Kibana
Open the Fleet section under the main menu
Open the "Agent policies" section
Press "Create agent policy" button to create a new Agent Policy
Give the policy a name, for example, "Syslog policy", adjust advance settings if required, create the policy. Or you can use the API request below:
sads
```
```
POST kbn:/api/fleet/agent_policies
{
"name": "Syslog policy",
"description": "",
"namespace": "default",
"monitoring_enabled": [
"logs",
"metrics"
],
"inactivity_timeout": 1209600,
"is_protected": false
}
```
```
Open your newly created policy by clicking on it's name
Press "Add integration"
Search for "Custom UDP logs" and press "Add Custom UDP logs"
Adjust configuration, make sure:
```
- Specify "Listen Address" to the IP address of your server that is going to run the Custom UDP logs integration , in this example the address
should be "10.0.0.2"
- Set "Listen Port" to "5514"
- Set" Dataset name" to "routeros"
- Set "Ingest Pipeline" to "logs-routeros@custom"
- Set "Syslog Parsing" to "Yes"
Save the integration
Press the "Add Elastic Agent to your host" button
Follow the instructions on how to add Elastic Agent to your host
```
Go to "Stack Management" on the main menu, then open "Ingest Pipelines"
Create a new Ingest Pipeline by pressing "Create pipeline" then "New pipeline"
Set "Name" to "logs-routeros@custom"
Press "Import processors" and paste the following processors:

Add Topics that you wish to receive from RouterOS device (10.0.0.1), for example:
```
```
/system logging
add action=remote topics=info
add action=remote topics=error
add action=remote topics=critical
add action=remote topics=warning
add action=remote topics=bridge,stp
```
```
You should now start to see Syslog data being ingested!
Continue the guide to start using Kibana
```
Using Kibana
Kibana allows you to search the ingested Syslog data, to see ingested logs do the following:
```
Log into your Kibana
Open "Discover" from the main menu
Add a filter, use the following parameters:
```
```
Select a field: data_stream.dataset
Select operator: IS
Select a value: routeros
```
```
For simplicity we recommend searching for fields in the  Discover menu and searching for "message", then adding the field to the view
We also recommend searching for "log.syslog.hostname" field and adding to the view as well.
Consider saving the search for easier access later
Done!
```
```
While searching for logs can be useful, you are more likely looking for a way to create alerts for certain activities and create connectors to send
alerts e-mail, webhooks, chats and other options. Consider enabling the Spike in failed logon events rule to alert for excessive failed login
attempts. You can also create a threshold rule and set it to alert after fixed amount of failed logins.

## Summary
Netwatch monitors the state of hosts on the network. Monitoring can be done with the following probe types:
1) ICMP - pings to a specified IP address - hosts, with an option to adjust threshold values
2) Simple - uses ping, without use of advanced metrics
3) TCP conn, to test the TCP connection
4) HTTP GET/HTTPS GET, request against a server you are monitoring
5) DNS - sends DNS query to DNS server and checks for response.
For each entry in the Netwatch table, you can specify an IP address, ping interval, and console scripts. The main advantage of Netwatch is its ability to
issue arbitrary console commands on host state changes.

## Properties
Sub-menu: /tool/netwatch
```
Property Description
```
```
host (Default:"") The IP address of the server to be probed. Formats:
```
- ipv4
- ipv4@vrf
- ipv6
- ipv6@vrf
- ipv6-linklocal%interface
- domain name (for type=dns)
```
Since 7.4, Netwatch functionality has been expanded, prior versions only support simple ICMP probes. While upgrading to the new version, old
Netwatch entries will be unchanged, reporting probe type "simple" - preserving the same functionality.
```
```
Default Netwatch values are always used -  even if they were not defined by the user. Make sure to check the "status" page of the probe to see
if the default thresholds are appropriate for your use case. Default threshold values can be found under the "probe options" section on this page.
```
```
type (icmp | tcp-conn | http-get | http-get | dns | s
imple; Default: simple)
```
```
Type of the probe:
```
- icmp - (ping-style) series of ICMP request-response with statistics
- tcp-conn - test TCP connection (3-way handshake) to a server specified by IP and port
- http-get - do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies
- https-get - do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies
- dns - do a specified DNS query for domain name
- simple - simplified ICMP probe, with fewer options than "ICMP" type, used for backward
compatibility with the older Netwatch version
```
interval (Default: 10s) The time interval between probe tests
```
```
timeout (Default: 3s) Max time limit to wait for a response
```
```
src-address (Default:"") Source IP address which the Netwatch will try to use in order to reach the host. If address is not
present, then the host will be considered as "down".
```
```
start-delay (Default: 3s) Time to wait before starting probe (on add, enable, or system start)
```
```
startup-delay (Default: 5m) Time to wait until starting Netwatch probe after system startup
```
```
up-script (Default:"") Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'fail' --> 'OK'
```
```
down-script (Default:"") Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'OK' --> 'fail'
```
```
test-script (Default:"") Script to execute at the end of every probe test
```
Netwatch executes scripts as *sys user, so any defined global variable in the Netwatch script will not be readable by for an example a scheduler or other
users
It is possible to disable permission checking for RouterOS scripts under /system/scripts menu. This is useful when Netwatch does not have enough
permissions to execute a script, though this decreases overall security. It is recommended to assign proper permissions to a script instead.
Type-specific options
All config options specific to one probe type (e.g. icmp's packet-interval) are ignored for other probe types.
ICMP probe options
```
Property Description
```
```
packet-interval (Default: 50ms) The time between ICMP-request packet send
```
```
packet-count (Default: 10 ) Total count of ICMP packets to send out within a single test
```
```
packet-size (Default: 54 (IPv4) or 54 (IPv6)) The total size of the IP ICMP packet
```
```
thr-rtt-max (Default: 1s) Fail threshold for rtt-max (a value above thr-max is a probe fail)
```
```
thr-rtt-avg (Default: 100ms) Fail threshold for rtt-avg
```
```
thr-rtt-stdev (Default: 250ms) Fail threshold for rtt-stdev
```
```
thr-rtt-jitter (Default: 1s) Fail threshold for rtt-jitter
```
```
thr-loss-percent (Default: 85.0%) Fail threshold for loss-percent
```
```
thr-loss-count (Default: 4294967295 (max)) Fail threshold for loss-count
```
```
ttl (Default;  255 ) Manually set time to live value for ICMP packet
```
```
accept-icmp-time-exceeded (yes | no; Default no) If the ICMP "time exceeded" message should be considered a valid response
```
```
Netwatch is limited to read,write,test,reboot script policies. If the owner of the script does not have enough permissions to execute a certain
command in the script, then the script will not be executed. If the script has greater policies than read,write,test,reboot - then the script will not
be executed as well, make sure your scripts do not exceed the mentioned policies.
```
TCP-CONNECT
```
Property Description
```
```
port (Default: 80 ) TCP port (for both tcp-conn and http-get probes)
```
TCP-CONNECT pass-fail criteria
```
Property Description
```
```
thr-tcp-conn-time (Default: 0
0:05...00:30)
```
```
Fail threshold for tcp-connect-time, the configuration uses microseconds, if the time unit is not specified (s/m/h), log and
status pages display the same value in milliseconds.
```
HTTP-GET probe options
```
Property Description
```
```
port (Default: 80 ) TCP port (for both tcp-conn and http-get probes)
```
HTTPS-GET probe options
```
Property Description
```
```
port (Default: 443 ) TCP port (for both tcp-conn and http-get probes)
```
```
certificate (Default:"") Certificate from local store that should be used for host verification.
```
```
check-certificate (yes | no; Default no) Enables trust chain validation from local certificate store.
```
HTTP-GET/HTTPS-GET probe pass/fail criteria
```
Property Description
```
```
thr-http-time (Default: 10s) Fail threshold for http-resp-time
```
```
http-code-min (Default: 1
00 )
```
```
OK/fail criteria for HTTP response code.
```
```
accept-icmp-time-exceeded=yes can be used together with a manually set low ttl value to monitor Internet connectivity, without relying
on a specific endpoint.
```
```
For example, you can monitor a public IP address, but that address can filter your ICMP request, or just become unreachable itself, if the
Netwatch probe is using this address to monitor Internet connectivity this would cause a false alarm.
```
```
To make sure you can reach the Internet, it's generally enough to make sure you can reach a device a few routing hops away. Low time to live
value will expire in transit to the specified host you want to monitor - each router passing the ICMP packet will subtract "1" from TTL value, upon
TTL reaching 0, ICMP "time exceeded" packet will be generated, and sent back to the Netwatch probe. If all other fail thresholds are not broken,
this response will be considered a success.
```
```
Simple, ICMP, HTTP, and TCP-connect probes are sent with the "don't fragment" flag set. With an ICMP probe, you can set packet-size,
which in combination with the DF flag, can be used to aid with path MTU discovery
```
```
http-code-max (Default: 2
99 )
```
```
Response in the range [http-code-min , http-code-max] is a probe pass/OK; outside - a probe fail. See mozilla-http-
status or rfc7231
```
DNS probe options
```
Property Description
```
```
host (Default:"") DNS name that should be resolved.
```
```
record-type (A | AAAA | MX | NS; Default: A
)
```
```
Record type that will be used for DNS probe.
```
```
dns-server The DNS server that the probe should send its requests to, if not specified it will use the value from "/ip
dns".
```
Probe statistics/variables
You can view statistics and use these variables in scripting, keep in mind that variables containing "-" must be written like this, for example, "done-tests"
would be $"done-tests"
Generic:
```
Property Description

status - Shows the current status of the host;
host - address being monitored
```
Quick Example
Here we will use a simple ICMP check to host with IP 8.8.8.8:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/netwatch add host=8.8.8.8 interval=30s up-script=":log info \"Ping to 8.8.8.8
successful\""
```
Afterward, in the logging section we can see Netwatch executed script:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > log print where message~"8.8.8.8"
08:03:26 script,info Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful
```

## Introduction
A packet sniffer is a tool that can capture and analyze packets that are going to, leaving, or going through the router. Packet sniffing is very useful when
you diagnose networks or protect against security attacks over networks.

## Packet Sniffer configuration
RouterOS embedded sniffer allows you to capture packets based on various protocols.
In the following example, we will configure the sniffer to match packets going through the ether1 interface:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/sniffer/start interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/sniffer/stop
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/sniffer/save file-name=/flash/test.pcap
MikroTik] > file print where name~"test"
Columns: NAME, TYPE, SIZE, CREATION-TIME
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
9 flash/test.pcap file 3696 dec/04/2019 10:48:16
```
You can download captured packets from a file section. Then you can use a packet analyzer such as Wireshark to analyze a file:
If you are using packet streaming to PC and are using Wireshark, to ensure you are only viewing the streamed data, you will need to apply a filter that
matches the port the sniffer is using, by default 37008 is used. In addition, we recommend using filter-stream=yes.
```
Unicast traffic between Wireless clients with client-to-client forwarding enabled will not be visible to the sniffer tool.
```
```
Packets that are processed with hardware offloading enabled bridge will not be visible (flooded packets like unknown unicast, broadcast, and
multicast traffic might be visible).
```
```
Sniffer catches packets before they go into the firewall (direction=rx) or after they leave it (direction=tx).
```

# Ping
```
Summary
Quick Example
MAC Ping
```

## Summary
Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo messages to determine if a remote host is active or inactive and to determine the round-trip
delay when communicating with it. Ping tool sends ICMP (type 8) message to the host and waits for the ICMP echo-reply (type 0). The interval between
these events is called a round trip. If the response (that is called pong) has not come until the end of the interval, we assume it has timed out. The second
significant parameter reported is TTL (Time to Live). Is decremented at each machine in which the packet is processed. The packet will reach its
destination only when the TTL is greater than the number of routers between the source and the destination.

## Quick Example
RouterOS Ping tool allows you to configure various additional parameters like:
```
arp-ping;
address;
src-address;
count;
dscp;
interface;
interval;
routing-table;
size;
ttl;
```
Let's take a look ar very simple example:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/ping address=10.155.126.252 count=5 interval=200ms
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME
STATUS
```
```
0 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
1 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
2 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
3 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
4 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```
The same we can achieve with more shorter CLI command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping 10.155.126.252 count=5 interval=50ms
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME
STATUS
```
```
0 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
1 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
2 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
3 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
4 10.155.126.252 56 64 0ms
sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```
It is also possible to ping multicast address to discover all hosts belonging to multicast group:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping ff02::1
HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
fe80::20c:42ff:fe49:fceb 56 64 1ms echo reply
fe80::20c:42ff:fe72:a1b0 56 64 1ms echo reply
fe80::20c:42ff:fe28:7945 56 64 1ms echo reply
fe80::21a:4dff:fe5d:8e56 56 64 3ms echo reply
sent=1 received=4 packet-loss=-300% min-rtt=1ms avg-rtt=1ms max-rtt=3ms
```
Ping by DNS name:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping http://www.google.com count=5 interval=50ms
SEQ HOST SIZE TTL TIME
STATUS
```
```
0 216.58.207.228 56 51 14ms
1 216.58.207.228 56 51 13ms
2 216.58.207.228 56 51 13ms
3 216.58.207.228 56 51 13ms
4 216.58.207.228 56 51 13ms
sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=13ms avg-rtt=13ms max-rtt=14ms
```
MAC Ping
This submenu allows enabling the mac ping server.
When mac ping is enabled, other hosts on the same broadcast domain can use the ping tool to ping mac address:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool mac-server ping set enabled=yes
```
Ping MAC address:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /ping 00:0C:42:72:A1:B0
HOST SIZE TTL TIME STATUS
00:0C:42:72:A1:B0 56 0ms
00:0C:42:72:A1:B0 56 0ms
sent=2 received=2 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```
```
When you use the domain name and CLI for ping, router DNS will be used to resolve the address. When you use the Winbox Tools/Ping, your
computer's DNS will be used to resolve the given address.
```


# Profiler
```
Summary
Classifiers
```

## Summary
The profiler tool shows CPU usage for each process running in RouterOS. It helps to identify which process is using most of the CPU resources.
Watch our video about this feature.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/profile
```
On multi-core systems, the tool allows specifying per core CPU usage.
"CPU" parameter allows specifying integer number which represents a core or two of predefined values all and total:
```
total - this value sets to show the sum of all core usages;
all - value sets to show CPU usages separately for every available core
```
In the following example we will take a look at both predefined values:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/profile cpu=all
NAME CPU USAGE
ethernet 1 0%
kvm 0 0%
kvm 1 4.5%
management 0 0%
management 1 0.5%
idle 0 100%
idle 1 93%
profiling 0 0%
profiling 1 2%
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool profile cpu=total
NAME CPU USAGE
ethernet all 0%
console all 0%
kvm all 2.7%
management all 0%
idle all 97.2%
profiling all 0%
bridging all 0%
```

IRQ
```
/system resource irq
```
The menu shows all used IRQs on the router. It is possible to set up IRQ load balancing on multicore systems by assigning IRQ to a specific core. IRQ
assignments are done by hardware and cannot be changed from RouterOS. For example, if all Ethernets are assigned to one IRQ, then you have to deal
with hardware: upgrade motherboards BIOS, reassign IRQs manually in BIOS, if none of the above helps then change the hardware.

## Overview
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks. SNMP can be used to graph various
data with tools such as CACTI, MRTG, or The Dude.
SNMP write support is only available for some OIDs. For supported OIDs SNMP v1, v2 or v3 write is supported.

## Quick Configuration
To enable SNMP in RouterOS:
```
SNMP will respond to the query on the interface SNMP request was received from forcing responses to have same source address as request
destination sent to the router
```
```
SNMP tool collects data from different services running on the system. If, for some reason, communication between SNMP and some service is
taking longer time than expected (30 seconds per service, 5 minutes for routing service), you will see a warning in the log stating "timeout while
waiting for program" or "SNMP did not get OID data within expected time, ignoring OID". After that, this service will deny SNMP requests for a
while before even trying to get requested data again.
```
```
This error has nothing to do with SNMP service itself. In most cases, such an error is printed when some slow or busy service is monitored
through SNMP, and quite often, it is a service that should not be monitored through SNMP, and proper solution in such cases is to skip such
OIDs on your monitoring tool.
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] /snmp> print
enabled: no
contact:
location:
engine-id:
trap-community: (unknown)
trap-version: 1
[admin@MikroTik] /snmp> set enabled yes
```
You can also specify administrative contact information in the above settings. All SNMP data will be available to communities configured in the community
menu.
General Properties
```
Sub-menu: /snmp
```
This sub menu allows to enable SNMP and to configure general settings.
```
Property Description
```
```
contact (string; Default: "") Contact information
```
```
enabled (yes | no;
Default: no)
```
```
Used to disable/enable SNMP service
```
```
engine-id (string;
Default: "")
```
```
For SNMP v3, used as part of the identifier. You can configure the suffix part of the engine id using this argument. If the
SNMP client is not capable to detect set engine-id value then this prefix hex has to be used 0x80003a8c04
```
```
location (string; Default: ""
)
```
```
Location information
```
```
trap-community (string;
Default: public)
```
```
Which communities configured in the community menu to use when sending out the trap.
```
```
trap-generators (interface
s | start-trap; Default: )
```
```
What action will generate traps:
```
```
interfaces - interface changes;
start-trap - SNMP server starting on the router
temp-exception - send trap when temperature reached 100c (or value configured for cpu-overtemp-temperature at
/system health )
```
```
trap-interfaces (string | all
; Default: )
```
```
List of interfaces that traps are going to be sent out.
```
```
trap-target (list of IP/IPv6;
Default: 0.0.0.0)
```
```
IP (IPv4 or IPv6) addresses of SNMP data collectors that have to receive the trap
```
```
trap-version (1|2|3;
Default: 1 )
```
```
A version of SNMP protocol to use for trap
```
```
src-address (IPv4 or
IPv6 address; Default: ::)
```
```
Force the router to always use the same IP source address for all of the SNMP messages
```
```
vrf (VRF name; default
value: main)
```
```
Set VRF on which service is listening for incoming connections
```
```
the engine-id field holds the suffix value of engine-id, usually, SNMP clients should be able to detect the value, as SNMP values, as read from
the router. However, there is a possibility that this is not the case. In which case, the engine-ID value has to be set according to this rule:
<engine-id prefix> + <hex-dump suffix>, so as an example, if you have set 1234 as suffix value you have to provide 80003a8c04 + 31323334,
combined hex (the result) is 80003a8c0431323334
```
Community Properties
```
Sub-menu: /snmp community
```
This sub-menu allows to set up access rights for the SNMP data.
There is little security in v1 and v2c, just Clear text community string („username“) and the ability for Limiting access by IP address.
In the production environment, SNMP v3 should be used as that provides security - Authorization (User + Pass) with MD5/SHA1, Encryption with DES and
AES).

Management information base (MIB)
The Management Information Base (MIB) is the database of information maintained by the agent that the manager can query. You can download the latest
MikroTik RouterOS MIB file from here: [http://www.mikrotik.com/downloads](http://www.mikrotik.com/downloads)
Used MIBs in RouterOS:
```
MIKROTIK-MIB

```
Traps
SNMP traps enable the router to notify the data collector of interface changes and SNMP service status changes by sending traps. It is possible to send
out traps with security features to support SNMPv1 (no security). SNMPv2 and variants and SNMPv3 with encryption and authorization.
For SNMPv2 and v3 you have to set up an appropriately configured community as a trap-community to enable required features (password or encryption
/authorization).
SNMP write
SNMP write allows changing router configuration with SNMP requests. Consider securing access to the router or to router's SNMP, when SNMP and write-
access are enabled.
To change settings by SNMP requests, use the command below to allow SNMP to write for the selected community.
```
/snmp community set <number> write-access=yes
```
System Identity
It's possible to change router system identity by SNMP set command.
```
$ snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.0.0 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s New_Identity
```
```
snmpset - SNMP application used for SNMP SET requests to set information on a network entity;
public - router's community name;
192.168.0.0 - IP address of the router;
1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 - SNMP value for router's identity;
```
SNMPset command above is equal to the RouterOS command:
```
/system identity set identity=New_Identity
```
Reboot
It's possible to reboot the router with SNMP set command, you need to set the value for reboot SNMP settings, which is not equal to 0.
```
$ snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.0.0 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.7.1.0 s 1
```
```
1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.7.1.0, SNMP value for the router reboot;
s 1, snmpset command to set value, value should not be equal to 0;
```
Reboot SNMPset command is equal to the RouterOS command:
```
/system reboot
```
Run Script
SNMP write allows running scripts on the router from the system script menu when you need to set value for the SNMP setting of the script.
```
$ snmpset -c public -v 1 192.168.0.0 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.X s 1
```
```
X, script number, numeration starts from 1;
s 1, snmpset command to set value, the value should not be equal to 0;
```
The same command on RouterOS:
```
/system script> print
Flags: I - invalid
0 name="test" owner="admin" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,
test,winbox,password,sniff last-started=jan/01/1970
01:31:57 run-count=23 source=:beep
```
```
/system script run 0
```
Running scripts with GET
It is possible to run /system scripts via SNMP GET request of the script OID (since 6.37). For this to work SNMP community with write permission is
required. OIDs for scripts can be retrieved via the SNMPWALK command as the table is dynamic.
Add script:
```
/system script
add name=script1 owner=admin policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="
/sy reboot "
add name=script2 owner=admin policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="[:
put output]"
```
Get the script OID table
```
$ snmpwalk -v2c -cpublic 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.2.1 = STRING: "script1"
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.2.2 = STRING: "script2"
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.1 = INTEGER: 0
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.8.1.1.3.2 = INTEGER: 0
```
To run the script use table 18
```
$ snmpget -v2c -cpublic 192.168.88.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.18.1.1.2.2
iso.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.18.1.1.2.2 = STRING: "output"
```


# Speed Test
```
Introduction
General interface properties
Configuration Example
```

## Introduction
The Speed Test is an easy test tool for measuring ping, jitter, TCP and UDP throughput from one MikroTik device, to another. The "speed-test" command
is based on the Ping Tool and Bandwidth Test. In order to use this command - Bandwidth test server needs to be accessible.

## General interface properties
The speed-test is based on five configurable properties:
```
address - IP address of host;
connection-count - If a device has more than 20 cores - core count will be used (default is 20);
password - Password for the remote device;
test-duration - Duration for each test (By default: 5 tests * 10 sec duration + 1sec pause between each test = 55sec);
user - Remote device username;
```

## Configuration Example
Bandwidth and speed tests should be conducted through the devices, not on them to ensure real-life simulation and not to overload the CPU on the
devices under testing,(DUT) due to the traffic generating process.
To run a simple test from device A (192.168.88.1) to device B (192.168.88.2):
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/speed-test address=192.168.88.1
status: done
time-remaining: 0s
ping-min-avg-max: 541us / 609us / 3.35ms
jitter-min-avg-max: 0s / 76us / 2.76ms
loss: 0% (0/100)
tcp-download: 921Mbps local-cpu-load:30%
tcp-upload: 920Mbps local-cpu-load:30% remote-cpu-load:25%
udp-download: 917Mbps local-cpu-load:6% remote-cpu-load:21%
udp-upload: 916Mbps local-cpu-load:20% remote-cpu-load:6%
```
If any of device CPU utilization during test reaches 100% warning message will appear:
```
[admin@MikroTik]] > /tool/speed-test address=192.168.88.1
;;; results can be limited by cpu, note that traffic generation/termination
performance might not be representative of forwarding performance
status: done
time-remaining: 0s
ping-min-avg-max: 541us / 609us / 3.35ms
jitter-min-avg-max: 0s / 76us / 2.76ms
loss: 0% (0/100)
tcp-download: 721Mbps local-cpu-load:78%
tcp-upload: 820Mbps local-cpu-load:100% remote-cpu-load:84%
udp-download: 906Mbps local-cpu-load:10% remote-cpu-load:54%
udp-upload: 895Mbps local-cpu-load:55% remote-cpu-load:12%
```
"test-duration" parameter allows changing the duration of all of the 5 tests:
```
) Ping test with 50ms delay
) TCP receive
) TCP send
```
) UDP receive
) UDP send


# S-RJ10 general guidance
```
Summary
General Guidance
Product specification
S+RJ10 Positioning in devices
Using the S+RJ10 Side by Side or with passive cooling devices
```

## Summary
MikroTik S+RJ10 is a unique 6-speed RJ-45 SFP+ module based on a Marvell 88X3310P transceiver. It offers up to 10 Gbps speeds using twisted-pair
copper cables. All the current MikroTik devices with an SFP+ cage support the S+RJ10 module. This article serves as a guideline of S+RJ10 usage in
MikroTik devices with both passive and active cooling.

## General Guidance

## Product specification
The average power consumption of the transceiver is 2.7 W (10GBASE-T, 30 m link) which is relatively high compared with the S+85DLC03D optical
module with a maximum 0.8W power consumption. The operating temperature is 0 to +70 C, but the transceiver itself can heat up to 90 C.

## S+RJ10 Positioning in devices
Due to high operating temperatures, it is recommended to use S+RJ10 transceivers while an optical transceiver or an unused SFP+ interface is in between
them. Take a look at the transceivers capable distance comparison table.
As mentioned, S+RJ10 heat up more than regular transceivers, and keeping them side by side can result in overheating, especially in devices with 4 linear
SFP cages. It is recommended to place S+RJ10 in every second interface while keeping an optical transceiver or an empty port in between them.
Even when using devices that come with separated SFP+ cages, for example, CRS309-1G-8S+, it is still not recommended to deploy the S+RJ10
transceivers beside each other. Use S+RJ10 in every second interface to avoid transceivers overheating which may cause unpredictable behavior.
```
Recommended S+RJ10 placement
```
```
It is not recommended to place transceivers side by side
```
Devices that come with 4 or 8-block SFP+ cages are not exceptions. It is recommended to use one S+RJ10 transceiver per 4xSFP+ cage block and avoid
placing them side by side. Keep at least one vertical row empty(without S+RJ10) after plugging the S+RJ10 transceiver.
```
Recommended S+RJ10 placement
```
```
We do not recommend to place transceivers side by side
```
Using the S+RJ10 Side by Side or with passive cooling devices
There might be situations when it is not possible to use the recommended layout of the transceivers. In such cases where two or more S+RJ10
transceivers are plugged in beside one another or modules are used in passive cooling devices, the network administrator has to ensure additional cooling.
The airflow around the device should be increased or the overall ambient temperature should be lowered to keep the temperature of the transceivers within
the recommended range.


# Torch
MikroTik Torch is a real-time traffic monitoring tool that can be used to monitor the traffic flow through an interface.
Watch our video about this feature.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/torch
```
You can monitor traffic classified by:
```
source address (IPv4 and IPv6);
destination address (IPv4 and IPv6);
port;
protocol;
mac-protocol;
VLAN ID;
mac-address;
DSCP;
```
MikroTik Torch shows the protocols you have chosen and the TX/RX data rate for each of them on the particular interface.
```
Traffic that appears in torch is before it has been filtered by a Firewall. This means you will be able to see packets that might get dropped by
your Firewall rules.
```
```
Unicast traffic between Wireless clients with client-to-client forwarding enabled will not be visible to the Torch tool. Packets that are processed
with hardware offloading enabled bridge will also not be visible (unknown unicast, broadcast and some multicast traffic will be visible to torch
tool).
```


# Traceroute
```
Overview
Quick Example
```

## Overview
Sub-menu: /tool traceroute
Traceroute displays the list of the routers that packet travels through to get to a remote host. The traceroute or tracepath tool is available on practically all
Unix-like operating systems and tracert on Microsoft Windows operating systems.
Traceroute operation is based on TTL value and ICMP “Time Exceeded” message. Remember that TTL value in IP header is used to avoid routing loops.
Each hop decrements TTL value by 1. If the TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded and ICMP Time Exceeded message is sent back to the sender
when this occurs.
Initially by traceroute, the TTL value is set to 1 when next router finds a packet with TTL = 1 it sets TTL value to zero, and responds with an ICMP "time
exceeded" message to the source. This message lets the source know that the packet traverses that particular router as a hop. Next time TTL value is
incremented by 1 and so on. Typically, each router in the path towards the destination decrements the TTL field by one unit TTL reaches zero.
Using this command you can see how packets travel through the network and where it may fail or slow down. Using this information you can determine the
computer, router, switch or other network device that possibly causing network issues or failures.

## Quick Example
```
[admin@MikroTik] > tool traceroute 10.255.255.1

## Introduction
MikroTik Traffic-Flow is a system that provides statistical information about packets that pass through the router. Besides network monitoring and
accounting, system administrators can identify various problems that may occur in the network. With help of Traffic-Flow, it is possible to analyze and
optimize the overall network performance. As Traffic-Flow is compatible with Cisco NetFlow, it can be used with various utilities which are designed for
Cisco's NetFlow.
Traffic Flow can process only that traffic which is processed by the router CPU, thus HW offloaded traffic will not be seen in Traffic Flow flows (for example,
HW offloaded bridged traffic).
Traffic-Flow supports the following NetFlow formats:
```
version 1 - This is the original format used by NetFlow. It provides basic information about IP packets flowing through a router but lacks support
for advanced features such as different types of protocols and Type of Service (ToS).
version 5 - An enhancement over Version 1, this format supports additional features such as Type of Service (ToS), TCP flags, and autonomous
system numbers. In addition to version 1, version 5 can include BGP AS and flow sequence number information. Currently, RouterOS does not
include BGP AS numbers.
version 9 - This version introduces a template-based export format, which allows for extensibility and support for new record types beyond what
previous versions could handle. It can export data based on a defined template and is capable of exporting both IPv4 and IPv6 flow information.
IPFIX - Standardized by the IETF, this protocol is based on NetFlow Version 9. It expands the capabilities further, allowing for more customizable
and flexible flow records. IPFIX supports new technologies that were not addressed by NetFlow, like multicast.
```

## General
Sub-menu: /ip traffic-flow
This section lists the configuration properties of Traffic-Flow.
```
Property Description
```
```
interfaces (string | all;
Default: all)
```
```
Names of those interfaces will be used to gather statistics for traffic-flow. To specify more than one interface, separate
them with a comma.
```
```
cache-entries (128k | 16k |
1k | 256k | 2k | ... ; Default:
4k)
```
```
Number of flows which can be in router's memory simultaneously.
```
```
active-flow-timeout (time;
Default: 30m)
```
```
Maximum life-time of a flow.
```
```
inactive-flow-timeout (time;
Default: 15s)
```
```
How long to keep the flow active, if it is idle. If a connection does not see any packet within this timeout, then traffic-flow
will send a packet out as a new flow. If this timeout is too small it can create a significant amount of flows and overflow the
buffer.
```
```
packet-sampling (no | yes;
Default: no)
```
```
Enable or disable packet sampling feature.
```
```
sampling-interval (integer;
Default: 0 )
```
```
The number of packets that are consecutively sampled.
```
```
sampling-space (integer;
Default: 0 )
```
```
The number of packets that are consecutively omitted.
```
In the following example:
```
/ip/traffic-flow/set packet-sampling=yes sampling-interval=2222 sampling-space=1111
```
2222 packet consecutive packets will be sampled and then 1111 will be omitted. Then the sampling cycle repeats in such a manner.
Targets
Sub-menu: /ip traffic-flow target
With Traffic-Flow targets we specify those hosts which will gather the Traffic-Flow information from the router.

Notes
By looking at the packet flow diagram you can see that traffic flow is at the end of the input, forward, and output chain stack. It means that traffic flow will
count only traffic that reaches one of those chains.
For example, you set up a mirror port on a switch, connect the mirror port to a router, and set traffic flow to count mirrored packets. Unfortunately, such a
setup will not work, because mirrored packets are dropped before they reach the input chain.
Other interfaces will appear in the report if traffic is passing through them and the monitoring interface.
Examples
This example shows how to configure Traffic-Flow on a router
Enable Traffic-Flow on the router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow> set enabled=yes
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow> print
enabled: yes
interfaces: all
cache-entries: 1k
active-flow-timeout: 30m
inactive-flow-timeout: 15s
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow>
```
Specify the IP address and port of the host, which will receive Traffic-Flow packets:
```
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow target> add dst-address=192.168.0.2 port=2055 version=9
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow target> print
Flags: X - disabled
# SRC-ADDRESS DST-ADDRESS PORT VERSION
0 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.2 2055 9
[admin@MikroTik] ip traffic-flow target>
```
Now the router starts to send packets with Traffic-Flow information.

# NetFlow analysis with Elasticsearch
```
Introduction
Prerequisites
Setup
Elastic
RouterOS
Using Kibana
Log retation
Use a different ILM policy
```

## Introduction
Elasticsearch is a popular NoSQL database that can be used to store a wide range of data, including NetFlow logs. Alongside with Kibana you can create
a powerful tool to analyze NetFlow data from your RouterOS devices. This guide will rely on Elasticsearch integrations and for it to work you need to have
a working Elasticsearch setup. This guide will not cover setup instructions for Elasticsearch and Kibana, but will cover the relevant steps to setup NetFlow
log collection and analysis.
There are many possible configurations that can be made with Elasticsearch, but for the sake of this guide we will use the following principle:
```
A RouterOS (10.0.0.1) device sends out NetFlow data to a server (10.0.0.2) running NetFlow integration
The server (10.0.0.2) running NetFlow integration ingests NetFlow data, processes the data and sends it to a Fleet Server (10.0.0.3)
A Fleet Server (10.0.0.3) stores the data in Elasticsearch (10.0.0.4)
Kibana (10.0.0.5) retrieves data from Elasticsearch (10.0.0.4), analyzes it and allows you to search the data
```

## Prerequisites
```
Setup Elasticsearch
```
```
Setup kibana
```
```
This guide will not use Logstash as a part of analyzing NetFlow data, it has been replaced by a Fleet Server.
```
```
It is possible to install Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet Server and NetFlow Records integration on the same device.
```
```
Elasticsearch is widely supported on many platforms. It is recommended to setup a cluster of Elasticsearch nodes.

```
Setup Fleet Server
```
Setup
The setup instructions are divided into two parts: Elastic (configuration regarding Elasticsearch, Kibana and Fleet Server) and RouterOS (configuration that
is relevant to your RouterOS device).
Elastic
```
Log into your Kibana
Open the Fleet section under the main menu
Open the "Agent policies" section
Press "Create agent policy" button to create a new Agent Policy
Give the policy a name, for example, "NetFlow policy", adjust advance settings if required, create the policy
Open your newly created policy by clicking on it's name
Press "Add integration"
Search for "NetfFlow Records" and press "Add NetFlow Records"
Adjust configuration, make sure:
```
- Specify "UDP host to listen on" to the IP address of your server that is going to run the NetFlow Records integration , in this example the
address should be "10.0.0.2"
Save the integration
Press the "Add Elastic Agent to your host" button
Follow the instructions on how to add Elastic Agent to your host
```
Make sure you have opened the NetFlow port on your host and elsewhere in the path from your RouterOS device (10.0.0.1), the default
destination port is 2055/UDP.
Your Elastic Agent is now ready to receive NetFlow data!
```
RouterOS
```
(optional) Create an Interface list (for example, "NetFlow_interfaces") and add interface that need NetFlow data analysis
```
```
/interface list
add name=NetFlow_interfaces
/interface list member
add interface=VLAN3000 list=NetFlow_interfaces
```
```
Configure Traffic-flow to send NetFlow data to your Elastic Agent (10.0.0.2)
```
```
Kibana can be installed on the same device on which you installed Elasticsearch, but it can also be installed on a separate device for
performance reasons. While it is possible to analyze NetFlow data without Kibana, it requires writing your own API requests, Kibana is
very easy to use and has a wide range of features.
```
```
It is possible to setup Fleet Server on the same device on which you installed Elasticsearch and/or Kibana. It is recommended to install
Fleet Server on a different device. Refer to Elasticsearch manual for recommendations on hardware and topology requirements.
```
```
Some steps might change over time, refer to Elastic's manual to find the most up-to-date steps.
```
```
Official Elastic's manual recommends installing the Elastic Agent as Fleet-managed. Consider following the recommendation since
managing the agents is easier when they are Fleet-managed.

```
/ip traffic-flow

/ip traffic-flow target
add dst-address=10.0.0.2
```
```
You should now start to see NetFlow data being ingested!
Continue the guide to start using Kibana
```
Using Kibana
The NetFlow Records integration provides some useful assets that can be used to analyze NetFlow data. Make sure you install the assets first before
continuing. The following section will give you some basic ways how to see NetFlow data.
```
Log into your Kibana
Open the "Dashboards" menu in the main menu
Search the Dashboards and find "NetFlow"
```
You should now see multiple NetFlow Dashboards. For example, try opening the "[Logs Netflow] Overview". If your NetFlow data is properly ingested, then
you should now see graphs that summarizes your traffic.
Another useful Dashboard is the "[Logs Netflow] Flow records", which shows you exact NetFlow records. A very useful feature is the filtering option (the +
button on top), that allows you add filters to NetFlow data, for example, you can filter the records to show only a single IP address:
There are other options such as searching for a specific time range. You should read more about Discover to understand the possibilities better.
For quick reference, these are the fields that you are most likely going to want to use for searching NEtFlow data:
```
source.ip
source.port
destination.ip
destination.port
network.transport
```
If you want to examine a single record, it is recommended to use the Discover view. NetFlow data can be found as "data_stream.dataset: netflow.log".
Log retation
Depending on your local laws you might be required to store NetFlow data for a specified period of time. Be aware that busy networks can generated a lot
of NetFlow data, even terabytes per day. You are most likely going to want to adjust LIfecycle Policy. By default the NetFlow data should go under the
"logs" policy. If you have multiple Elasticsearch nodes, you can utilize "phases", which allows you to store data on different types of storage media, but if
you only have a single Elasticsearch node, your options are limited and you will most likely want to delete old data. For example, if you want to delete data
after 6 months, then you can simply change the ILM policy to delete data after 6 months or use this API request:
```
Some steps might change over time, refer to Elastic's manual to find the most up-to-date steps.
```

### 1.
```
PUT _ilm/policy/logs
{
"policy": {
"phases": {
"hot": {
"min_age": "0ms",
"actions": {
"rollover": {
"max_age": "30d",
"max_primary_shard_size": "50gb"
},
"set_priority": {
"priority": 101
}
}
},
"delete": {
"min_age": "180d",
"actions": {
"delete": {
"delete_searchable_snapshot": true
} } } } } }
```
Use a different ILM policy
If you want your NetFlow data to have a different retention period, then you need to do the following steps:
```
Create a new ILM policy, give it a new name and set the desired period for the delete phase, or use this API request:
```
```
PUT _ilm/policy/netflow-logs
{
"policy": {
"phases": {
"hot": {
"min_age": "0ms",
"actions": {
"rollover": {
"max_age": "30d",
"max_primary_shard_size": "50gb"
},
"set_priority": {
"priority": 101
}
}
},
"delete": {
"min_age": "1000d",
"actions": {
"delete": {
"delete_searchable_snapshot": true
} } } } } }
```
```
If you change the "logs" policy, this will apply to ALL your logs, not just NetFlow data. If you need a different retention period for other logs, then
it is better to create a new ILM policy and specify the NetFlow integration to use the newly created ILM policy.
```

Goto Kibana, open "Stack Management", then go to "Index Management" and then "Component Templates"
Search for "logs-netflow.log@custom", open it and edit it
Go to the "Index settings" section
Paste in the following:
```

Configuration Examples
IPsec tunnel performance test
```

## Summary
Traffic Generator is a tool that allows evaluating the performance of DUT (Device Under Test) or SUT (System Under Test).
The tool can generate and send RAW packets over specific ports. It also collects latency and jitter values, TX/RX rates, counts lost packets, and detects
Out-of-Order (OOO) packets.
Traffic Generator can be used similar to bandwidth test tool as well as generate packets that will be routed back to packet generator for advanced status
collection.

## General
```
/tool traffic-generator
```
This menu allows to set general traffic generator properties and contains commands to quickly start and stop the tool.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
latency-distribution-
max (time; Default: 10
0us)
```
```
Maximal latency range for latency distribution measurements. Based on this value, RouterOS will decide what latency range to
use as the latency-distribution-measure-interval property
```
```
measure-out-of-order (
yes | no; Default: )
```
```
Whether to measure Out-of-Order packets. The default value is based on CPU type (multi-core CPU default no; single-core
CPU default yes). When the property is enabled on the multi-core device, a single stream will utilize only a single CPU core
```
```
stats-samples-to-keep
(integer; Default: 100 )
```
```
How many data examples to collect
```
```
test-id (integer [0..255]
; Default: 0 )
```
Read-Only Properties
```
In a device, which generates packets, it will not be possible to capture packets generated by the traffic-generator with a sniffer tool, torch, or
firewall on the outgoing interface.
```
```
Since this tool could be used maliciously, it is possible to lock this functionality by entering the command '/system device-mode update traffic-
gen=no' and holding the reset button afterwards.
```
```
Property Description
```
```
latency-distribution-samples (integer) Shows how many individual time periods the latency-distribution-measure-interval is divided into
```
```
latency-distribution-measure-interval (time) Shows total latency measurement range
```
```
running (yes | no) Shows whether the traffic generator tool is started.
```
Commands
```
Property Description
```
```
quick () This command allows to quickly start the packet generator and print the stats output to the terminal. Command also accepts several
parameters that override settings in packet template and stream settings. Accepted parameters are duration, entries-to-show, freeze-frame-
interval, id, interface, mbps, measure-out-of-order, packet-count, packet-size, port, pps, stream, test-id, tx-template
```
```
tx-template - packet templates to generate traffic (max 16 templates)
duration - how long to run the test
entries-to-show - how many status lines print to the terminal
freeze-frame-interval - how often to update the status to the terminal
```
```
The rest of the parameters are not command-specific and are described elsewhere.
Parameters specified when running quick command override configured values. In case if a parameter is specified only for one header then
the value is multiplied for all the other headers (if required).
```
```
start () Commands start the traffic generator tool in the background. It accepts one parameter test-id
```
```
stop () Command stops the started traffic generator tool by start command.
```
```
inject () Inject raw data into the interface.
```
```
inject-
pcap ()
```
```
Inject raw data directly from pcap file.
```
Packet Template
```
/tool traffic-generator packet-template
```
This sub-menu allows building packets based on provided parameters. Based on parameters you can build IP packets with VLAN tags and set UDP ports.
A raw packet template is generated based on provided parameters.
If you require more low-level packets or take full advantage of the traffic generator, then please use a raw-packet-template builder to build the packet.
If the same type of header is present in the packet more than once then header field values are passed as a comma-separated list. (For example, if there
are two IP headers then source addresses are given like "IP-src=1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2").
For quicker header construction many of the header field values are assumed. For example, if the header stack is "mac, IP" then the traffic generator can
assume that the mac-protocol value is "IP". Or if the "port" or "interface" setting is specified traffic generator can assume "mac-src" to be the MAC address
of the interface). Assumed values have distinct names that start with "assumed-" and are read-only. Manually specified values override assumed ones.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
comment (string; Default: ) Short description of the packet you are building.
```
```
Assumed values are not automatically updated. New values are assumed after template edit. "packet-template set 0" is enough to trigger new
assumed values
```
compute-checksum-from-
offset (no-checksum |
integer[0..4294967295];
Default: )
```
specifies the byte offset from where in the packet 2-byte checksum will be calculated (Example: set to 14, to skip packets
Ethernet header when calculating checksum)
```
data (incrementing |
random | specific-byte |
uninitialized; Default: uninitia
lized)
```
Specifies how packet payload will be filled:
```
```
uninitialized - packets data (after the header) is uninitialized, but not zero. Fastest.
specific-byte - works together with setting data-byte
incrementing - packets data filled with "00 01 02 03" and so on
random - packets data filled with random bytes. Slowest.
```
data-byte (hex [0..FF]];
Default: 0 )
```
A byte will be used to fill the packet payload.
```
interface (string; Default: ) Optional parameter of packet template. This is mutually exclusive with the "port" setting. Specifying "interface" allows
users not to create a port entry for interface in the port menu. In fact, a port entry is created dynamically. This is useful for
running quick tests.
ip-dscp (list of integer[0..
255] (max 16 times);
Default: )
```
Single or list of DS Fields that will be set in IP header (DS Field contains DSCP value and the ECN value)
```
ip-dst (list of IP/Netmask
(max 16 times); Default: )
```
List of destination IP addresses that will be used when generating IP headers.
```
ip-frag-off (list of integer[0..
65535] (max 16 times);
Default: )
```
List of fragmentation offsets in IP header.
```
ip-gateway (IP; Default: ) In situations when sender and receiver are the same devices, it is impossible to determine next-hop automatically from ip-
dst. If ip-gateway is specified packet template will assume the destination mac address based on resolved ip-gateway.
ip-id (list of integer [0..
65535]; Default: )
ip-protocol (list of IP
protocols (max 16 times);
Default: )
ip-src (list of IP/Mask (max
16 times); Default: )
ip-ttl (list of integer [0..255]
(max 16 times); Default: )
mac-dst (list of MAC/MASK
(max 16 times); Default: )
mac-protocol (list of mac
protocols (max 16 times);
Default: )
mac-src (list of MAC/MASK
(max 16 times); Default: )
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of the template.
port (string; Default: ) Optional parameter of packet template. This suggests a port through which packets generated using this template should
be sent out. Port can also be specified in other places such as in stream settings. This is mutually exclusive with
interface setting.
raw-header (string (max 16
times); Default: )
```
Raw packet header as string in hexadecimal format.
```
udp-dst-port (list of port [0..
65535]/mask [0..FFFF]
(max 16 times); Default: )
```
udp-src-port (list of port [0..
65535]/mask [0..FFFF]
(max 16 times); Default: )
```
```
vlan-id (; Default: )
```
```
vlan-priority (; Default: )
```
```
vlan-protocol (; Default: )
```
```
header-stack (list of ip |
mac | raw | udp | vlan (max
16 times); Default: ip)
```
```
A sequence of headers that a generated packet should have.
Currently supports:
```
```
mac - Ethernet header (14 bytes)
vlan - Ethernet VLAN tag (4 bytes)
ip - IPv4 header (20 bytes)
udp - UDP header (8 bytes)
raw - arbitrary bytes specified as a hex string
```
```
Most header types can be present in the header multiple times. There can be only 2 IP headers and 1 UDP header per
packet. Some limitations are imposed on possible sequences of headers based on our practical experience with network
protocols (for example VLAN header can follow only a mac header or other VLAN header).
The traffic generator suggests the first header for a packet template (in the port menu). But it is not enforced.
```
Port Configuration
```
/tool traffic-generator port
```
This menu allows configuring ports that will be associated with a specific interface and will be used to receive/send generated packets.
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
disabled (yes | no; Default: no) Whether the port is disabled and does not participate in receiving/sending the packets
```
```
name (string; Default: ) Descriptive name of the port
```
```
interface (string; Default: ) Name of the interface associated with the port.
```
Read-Only Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
dynamic (yes | no) Whether the port configuration is generated automatically.
```
```
first-header (ip | mac | raw |
udp | vlan)
```
```
Shows suggested the first header for packets to be sent out of the specified interface. This information can be used
when creating packet templates.
```
```
inactive (yes | no) Whether the port is inactive and can't participate in tx/rx of the packets.
```
Stats
```
/tool traffic-generator stats
```
If the traffic generator is not running in quick mode then all statistics about the test is stored in this menu.
Latency Distribution
```
/tool traffic-generator stats latency-distribution
```
This sub-menu shows how many packets are received in a specific latency range. Latency range can be viewed by streams or by sequences (for example,
print stream-num=3, print seq=10)
Here is an example output of the latency graph:
[admin@test-host] /tool traffic-generator stats latency-distribution> print

Configuration Examples
IPsec tunnel performance test
Consider following test setup
System Under Test (SUT) consists of two routers connected to a traffic generator server. The connection between both SUT routers is IPSec encrypted.
The traffic generator will run two streams:
```
in a direction from 1.1.1.0/24 network to 2.2.2.0/24 network
in a direction from 2.2.2.0/24 network to 1.1.1.0/24 network.
```
R1 routing and IPsec setup
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.33.1/30 interface=ether1
add address=1.1.1.2/24 interface=ether2
```
```
/ip route
add dst-address=2.2.2.0/24 gateway=192.168.33.2
```
```
/ip ipsec proposal
set default enc-algorithms=aes-128
```
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=192.168.33.2 secret=123
```
```
/ip ipsec policy
add sa-src-address=192.168.33.1 sa-dst-address=192.168.33.2 \
src-address=1.1.1.0/24 dst-address=2.2.2.0/24 tunnel=yes
```
R2 routing and IPsec setup
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.33.2/30 interface=ether1
add address=2.2.2.2/24 interface=ether2
```
```
/ip route
add dst-address=1.1.1.0/24 gateway=192.168.33.1
```
```
/ip ipsec proposal
set default enc-algorithms=aes-128
```
```
/ip ipsec peer
add address=192.168.33.1 secret=123
```
```
/ip ipsec policy
add sa-src-address=192.168.33.2 sa-dst-address=192.168.33.1 \
src-address=2.2.2.0/24 dst-address=1.1.1.0/24 tunnel=yes
```
Traffic generator server setup
```
/ip address
add address=1.1.1.1/24 interface=ether2
add address=2.2.2.1/24 interface=ether3
```
First, we will define which ports will be used as traffic generator tx/rx ports
```
/tool traffic-generator port
add disabled=no interface=ether2 name=port0
add disabled=no interface=ether3 name=port1
```
To construct the actual packet that will be generated, packet-template is used.
```
/tool traffic-generator packet-template
add header-stack=mac,ip,udp ip-dst=2.2.2.1/32 ip-gateway=1.1.1.2 ip-src=1.1.1.1/32 \
name=routing-1 port=port0
add header-stack=mac,ip,udp ip-dst=1.1.1.1/25 ip-gateway=2.2.2.2 ip-src=2.2.2.1/32 \
name=routing-2 port=port1
```
Notice that mac addresses were not specified since the template generator can assume the next-hop mac address automatically by sending ARP
messages. Since we are doing routing and destination IP is not directly reachable, we have set the ip-gateway parameter to determine the next-hop mac-
address.
When running print you can see all assumed (detected) values including mac addresses.
```
[admin@test-host] /tool traffic-generator packet-template> print
0 name="routing-1" header-stack=mac,ip,udp port=port0
assumed-mac-dst=00:0C:42:00:38:9D assumed-mac-src=00:0C:42:40:94:25
assumed-mac-protocol=ip assumed-ip-dscp=0 assumed-ip-id=0
assumed-ip-frag-off=0 assumed-ip-ttl=64 assumed-ip-protocol=udp
ip-src=1.1.1.1/32 ip-dst=2.2.2.1/32 assumed-udp-src-port=100
assumed-udp-dst-port=200 ip-gateway=1.1.1.2 data=uninitialized data-byte=0
```
```
1 name="routing-2" header-stack=mac,ip,udp port=port1
assumed-mac-dst=00:0C:42:00:38:D1 assumed-mac-src=00:0C:42:40:94:26
assumed-mac-protocol=ip assumed-ip-dscp=0 assumed-ip-id=0
assumed-ip-frag-off=0 assumed-ip-ttl=64 assumed-ip-protocol=udp
ip-src=2.2.2.1/32 ip-dst=1.1.1.1/32 assumed-udp-src-port=100
assumed-udp-dst-port=200 ip-gateway=2.2.2.2 data=uninitialized data-byte=0
```
For example, if any router in SUT were to change, assumed mac-addresses would not be updated automatically. To update packet templates simply issue
command:
```
/tool traffic-generator packet-template set [find]
```
The last part is to configure streams
```
/tool traffic-generator stream
add disabled=no mbps=500 name=str1 id=3 packet-size=1450 port=port0 pps=0 \
tx-template=routing-1
add disabled=no mbps=500 name=str3 id=4 packet-size=1450 port=port1 pps=0 \
tx-template=routing-2
```
Notice that each stream has a unique id value. This value identifies stream packets, otherwise, the traffic generator will not work.
Now we are ready to run the test. In this case, quick mode will be used:
```

# Watchdog
```
Summary
Properties
Quick Example
```

## Summary
Sub-menu: /system watchdog
This menu allows the configuring system to reboot, when a specific IP address does not respond, or when it detects, that the software has locked up. The
detection is done in two ways:
```
Software watchdog timer (mostly caused by hardware malfunction) device can recover itself with a reboot;
Ping watchdog can monitor connectivity to a specific IP address and trigger the reboot function.
```

## Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
auto-send-supout (yes
| no; Default: no)
```
```
After the support output file is automatically generated, it can be sent by email.
```
```
automatic-supout (yes
| no; Default: yes)
```
```
When software failure happens, a file named "autosupout.rif" is generated automatically. The previous "autosupout.rif" file is
renamed to "autosupout.old.rif".
```
```
no-ping-delay (time;
Default: 5m)
```
```
Specifies how long will it wait before trying to reach the watch-address.
```
```
ping-timeout (time;
Default: 60s)
```
```
Specifies the time interval in which the device will be pinged 6 times (after "no-ping-delay").
```
```
send-email-from (string
; Default: )
```
```
The e-mail address to send the support output file from. If not set, the value set in /tool e-mail is used.
```
```
send-email-to (string;
Default: )
```
```
The e-mail address to send the support output file to.
```
```
send-smtp-server (string
; Default: )
```
```
SMTP server address to send the support output file through. If not set, the value set in /tool e-mail is used.
```
```
watch-address (IP;
Default: )
```
```
The system will reboot, in case 6 sequential pings to the given IP address will fail. If set to none this feature is disabled. By
default, the router will reboot every 6 minutes if the watch-address is set and not reachable.
```
```
watchdog-timer (yes |
no; Default: yes)
```
```
Whether to reboot if a system is unresponsive for a minute.
```

## Quick Example
To make system generate a support output file and sent it automatically to support@example.com through the 192.0.2.1in case of a software crash:
```
Note: These are two different Watchdog features and both have their own settings. By default software Watchdog is enabled and ping
Watchdog is disabled. You can enable ping Watchdog by specifying an IP address and you can disable the software Watchdog by unsetting the
Watchdog Timer option.
```
```
Note: Watchdog reboot is not a system failure. Such reboot also will not generate autosupout file. Watchdog reboot is "/system reboot"
automatically triggered by operating system when some service is not responding as fast as it should. Reasons for that can vary between
damaged hardware, slow software implementation for some service, DDoS attack, bad configuration and others.
```

## Overview
Sub-menu: /ip cloud
Packages required: routeros
RouterOS version required: v7.12 and newer
Hardware requirements: ARM/ARM64/TILE architecture devices
Back To Home is a convenience feature, that configures your device for secure VPN access from anywhere in the world to your router and your network,
even if your router does not have a public IP address, is behind NAT or Firewall.
Configuration is done with MikroTik Back to Home app (Android, iPhone).
If the VPN server (your home router) has a public IP address, the VPN app will create a direct VPN connection between the phone and the router.
However, if the router is not directly reachable from the internet, the connection will be made through the MikroTik relay servers. The connection is always
end-to-end encrypted, the relay server or any other device does not have access to the encryption keys, in essence, the relay only helps your device to
reach the router. The connection will appear as going out from your router, not from the relay. In case of going through relay, speed could be limited.
This feature is a convenient option to access your home network or view content available in your home country, from locations, where some content is not
available. It is not meant for anonymity, it is for simple one click access to your home network. For more granular security controls, we recommend to
manually configure and secure a VPN connection using the advanced RouterOS options.

## Enabling BTH using the app
To set up Back to Home, you should have a smartphone with the BTH app and should be inside your home, connected to your routers WiFi network.
```
Connect to router's Wi-Fi using your phone;
Open the Back to Home application (Android, iPhone);
Tap "Create new";
Enter your local router IP address (most likely 192.168.88.1), username, and password of your router, tap "Connect";
Give tunnel a name, then tap"Create tunnel";
Your phone will ask for permission to add new VPN settings, approve it with your phone pin;
Setup is done. You can now disconnect from router's Wi-Fi and connect to any other network, like LTE/5G or simply leave your house now;
Tap the Connect button to toggle connection of the selected tunnel.
```
```
Tap "Create new" Provide your router credentials Connection established Allow VPN to be added
```
Sharing the BTH connection with another phone user
It is possible to create Guest tunnels for your friends and family. You can even specify if you want these people to access your local network as well, or if
they should be restricted to only use the internet via your router. Once you create shared tunnels, you can send Invitation links via any chat application in
your phone, or show a QR code to your friend in person (in both these cases, the friend will have to also install the BTH app). If you want to connect to
your router via the WireGuard(TM) app from another phone or from a computer, it is possible as well. Just select the share WireGuard(TM) config file, and
open this file in the WireGuard(TM) app.
```
Manage shares Connect to your tunnel first Once connected, Create shares Provide a name and access
level
```
```
Share sheet opens
```
To share your tunnel with somebody:
```
As the owner, connect to your BTH tunnel
```

### 1.

### 2.
```
Click the "..." icon next to your tunnel and click "Manage shares"
Enter the administration password for the router, since you will be modifying the router config
Tap "Create" in the Shares manager
Enter your friends name in the "Tunnel name", since a new tunnel will be made for them
Specify expiry date of this new Guest tunnel
Specify if the user will need to access your intenal network of your home. Do not check this if they only want to use this tunnel for internet access
Once "Create tunnel" has been pressed, phone Share Sheet opens. Select method how to send the invite link
Once the other person clicks on this link, he will either be directed to install the BTH app, or the BTH app will open and will allow to set up this
new Guest tunnel in their phone
```
Sharing the BTH tunnel with a computer via the WireGuard(TM) app
Since there is no BTH app for PCs, you can use WireGuard(TM) app to connect to the shared tunnel. You can even share your connection with yourself,
by "inviting" your computer to connect.
Let's make a new share, this time for yourself, for using from the PC.
```
Create Specify name and access level You have two shares now  Click "..." to send invite Pick "Share WireGuard
config  file"
```
Install the WireGuard app in your computer and click "Import Tunnel from file"
Configuring BTH manually in RouterOS (optional, if no smartphone is available to you)
```
Connect to router
```
```
Important notice
```
```
It is important to note, NOTHING has to be configured in RouterOS to use Back to Home. Simply use the BTH app (see above section) to
enable it. The whole point of Back to Home is to avoid using Winbox or command line. Below instructions are only for debugging or seasoned
administrators.

Removing and disabling connections
In the smartphone app, the VPN configuration is added to the System VPN settings. In this regard, the Back to Home app only acts as a wizard. It supplies
needed config to the operating system (this is why iPhone will warn you about altering system configuration).
To remove the created connection, go into the smartphone settings app and remove the VPN connections from there.
In the MikroTik router side, you should manually delete the added Peers in the Wireguard menu. Note that "revoke-and-disable" button can't be used to
"Pause" the use of the Back to Home feature. Once you revoke-and-disable in RouterOS, all Peers will be disassociated from the Cloud / Relay servers,
and you will have to re-create the connection from the Smartphone app. Therefore, once you have used the option "revoke-and-disable" in RouterOS IP
Cloud menu, you need to also delete the Peers from the Wireguard menu, as they can't be re-used.

print. This is intended for the VPN to work in the case that the device does not have access to a public IP address and opts to establish
the connection by using MikroTIk's relay server.
In the case your device has access to a public IP address, the generated peer entry is ignored:
```
```

## Summary
Sub-menu: /container
Packages required: container
A container is MikroTik's implementation of Linux containers, allowing users to run containerized environments within RouterOS. The container feature was
added in RouterOS v7.4beta4.

## Disclaimer

## Security risks:
when a security expert publishes his exploit research - anyone can apply such an exploit;
someone will build a container image that will do the exploit AND provide a Linux root shell;
by using a root shell someone may leave a permanent backdoor/vulnerability in your RouterOS system even after the container image is removed and the
container feature disabled;
if a vulnerability is injected into the primary or secondary RouterBOOT (or vendor pre-loader), then even netinstall may not be able to fix it;

## Requirements
Container package is compatible with arm arm64 and x86 architectures. Using of remote-image (similar to docker pull) functionality requires a lot of free
space in main memory, 16MB SPI flash boards may use pre-build images on USB or other disk media.
```
you need physical access to the router to enable support for the container feature, it is disabled by default;
once the container feature is enabled, containers can be added/configured/started/stopped/removed remotely!
if the router is compromised, containers can be used to easily install malicious software in your router and over network;
your router is as secure as anything you run in container;
if you run container, there is no security guarantee of any kind;
running a 3rd party container image on your router could open a security hole/attack vector/attack surface;
an expert with knowledge how to build exploits will be able to jailbreak/elevate to root;
```

Container use example
Prerequisites:
```
RouterOS device with RouterOS v7.4beta or later and installed Container package
Physical access to a device to enable container mode
Attached hard drive or USB drive for storage - formatted as ext3/ext4
```
Enable Container mode
enable container mode
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes
```
You will need to confirm the device-mode with a press of the reset button, or a cold reboot, if using container on X86.
Create network
Add veth interface for the container:
```
/interface/veth/add name=veth1 address=172.17.0.2/24 gateway=172.17.0.1
```
Create a bridge for containers and add veth to it:
```
/interface/bridge/add name=containers
/ip/address/add address=172.17.0.1/24 interface=containers
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=containers interface=veth1
```
Setup NAT for outgoing traffic:
```
Device-mode limits container use by default, before granting container mode access - make sure your device is fully secured.
```
```
/ip/firewall/nat/add chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=172.17.0.0/24
```
Add environment variables and mounts (optional)
Create environment variables for container(optional):
```
/container/envs/add name=pihole_envs key=TZ value="Europe/Riga"
/container/envs/add name=pihole_envs key=WEBPASSWORD value="mysecurepassword"
/container/envs/add name=pihole_envs key=DNSMASQ_USER value="root"
```
Define mounts (optional):
```
/container/mounts/add name=etc_pihole src=disk1/etc dst=/etc/pihole
/container/mounts/add name=dnsmasq_pihole src=disk1/etc-dnsmasq.d dst=/etc/dnsmasq.d
```
Add container image
If You wish to see container output in log - add logging=yes when creating a container, root-dir should point to an external drive formatted in ext3 or
ext4. It's not recommended to use internal storage for containers.
There are multiple ways to add containers:
a) get an image from an external library
Set registry-url (for downloading containers from Docker registry)  and set extract directory (tmpdir) to attached USB media:
```
/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=disk1/pull
```
pull image:
```
/container/add remote-image=pihole/pihole:latest interface=veth1 root-dir=disk1/pihole mounts=dnsmasq_pihole,
etc_pihole envlist=pihole_envs
```
The image will be automatically pulled and extracted to root-dir, status can be checked by using
```
/container/print
```
b) import image from PC
These links are latest  as of 16th of June, 2022. Please make sure to download the right version that matches Your RouterOS device's architecture.
Update sha256 sum from docker hub to get the latest image files
```
src=  points to RouterOS location (could also be src=disk1/etc_pihole if, for example, You decide to put configuration files on external
USB media), dst= points to defined location (consult containers manual/wiki/github for information on where to point). If src  directory does not
exist on first time use then it will be populated with whatever container have in dst  location.
```
```
arm64:
docker pull pihole/pihole:latest@sha256:4cef8a7b32d318ba218c080a3673b56f396d2e2c74d375bef537ff5e41fc4638
docker save pihole/pihole > pihole.tar
```
```
arm
docker pull pihole/pihole:latest@sha256:684c59c7c057b2829d19d08179265c79a9ddabf03145c1e2fad2fae3d9c36a94
docker save pihole/pihole > pihole.tar
```
```
amd64
docker pull pihole/pihole:latest@sha256:f56885979dcffeb902d2ca51828c92118199222ffb8f6644505e7881e11eeb85
docker save pihole/pihole > pihole.tar
```
After the file has been downloaded and extracted - upload it to Your RouterOS device. Create a container from tar image
```
/container/add file=pihole.tar interface=veth1 envlist=pihole_envs root-dir=disk1/pihole mounts=dnsmasq_pihole,
etc_pihole hostname=PiHole
```
c) build an image on PC
Steps for Linux systems
To use Dockerfile and make your own docker package - docker needs to be installed as well as buildx or other builder toolkit.
Easiest way is to download and install Docker Engine:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
After install check if extra architectures are available:
```
docker buildx ls
```
should return:

### NAME/NODE DRIVER/ENDPOINT STATUS PLATFORMS
```
default * docker
default default running linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/riscv64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x, linux
/386, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
```
If not - install extra architectures:
```
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```
pull or create your project with Dockerfile included  and build, extract image (adjust --platform if needed):
```
git clone https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole.git
cd docker-pi-hole
docker buildx build --no-cache --platform arm64 --output=type=docker -t pihole.
docker save pihole > pihole.tar
```
Upload pihole.tar to Your RouterOS device.
Images and objects on the Linux system can be pruned
Create a container from the tar image
```
/container/add file=pihole.tar interface=veth1 envlist=pihole_envs mounts=dnsmasq_pihole,etc_pihole
hostname=PiHole
```
Start container
Make sure container has been added and status=stopped by using /container/print
```
/container/start 0
```
You should be able to access the PiHole web panel by navigating to [http://172.17.0.2/admin/ ](http://172.17.0.2/admin/ ) in your web browser.
Forward ports to internal container
Ports can be forwarded using dst-nat (where 192.168.88.1 routers IP address):
```
/ip firewall nat
add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.88.1 dst-port=80 protocol=tcp to-addresses=172.17.0.2 to-
ports=80
```
For Pihole container - set DNS server to containers veth interface IP address -
```
/ip dns set servers=172.17.0.2
```
or change DHCP servers settings to serve Pihole DNS
Tips and tricks
```
Containers use up a lot of disk space, USB/SATA,NVMe attached media is highly recommended. For devices with USB ports - USB to SATA
adapters can be used with 2.5" drives - for extra storage and faster file operations.
RAM usage can be limited by using:
```
```
/container/config/set ram-high=200M
```
this will soft limit RAM usage - if a RAM usage goes over the high boundary, the processes of the cgroup are throttled and put under heavy reclaim
pressure.
```
For starting containers after router reboot use start-on-boot option (starting from 7.6beta6)
```
```
/container/print
0 name="2e679415-2edd-4300-8fab-a779ec267058" tag="test_arm64:latest" os="linux" arch="arm"
interface=veth2
root-dir=disk1/alpine mounts="" dns="" logging=yes start-on-boot=yes status=running
```
```
/container/set 0 start-on-boot=yes
```
```
It is possible to get to running container shell:
```
```
/container/shell 0
```
```
Enable logging to get output from container:
```
```
/container/set 0 logging=yes
```
```
Starting from 7.11beta5 version multiple addresses and ipv6 addresses can be added:
```
interface/veth add address=172.17.0.3/16,fd8d:5ad2:24:2::2/64 gateway=172.17.0.1 gateway6=fd8d:5ad2:24:

## Introduction
The introduction of the container feature into the RouterOS made it possible to run all kinds of servers for all sorts of tasks inside the router. This is
especially relevant for people, who want to reduce the number of devices in their network. Instead of running a server on a separate device/machine, why
not run it inside the router?
Radius is short for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. RouterOS has a RADIUS client feature supported that can authenticate for HotSpot, PPP, P
PPoE, PPTP, L2TP, and ISDN connections. Basically, this feature allows you to connect RouterOS to a Radius Server, and then, utilize the user database
from the server for client authentication.
In our example, we will showcase freeradius/freeradius-server image installation.

## Summary
Sub-menu: /container
note: container package is required.
Make sure to study our container guide before proceeding with the configuration. Make sure to check the disclaimer and requirements sections to
understand all the risks and necessary steps you might be required to do.
At the time, when the guide was published, the image was available for linux/amd64 OS/architecture only. Meaning, you are not able to run this scenario
on our arm32-bit and arm64-bit architecture RouterOS devices. For arm64, arm you will need to make your own container from FreeRADIUS source.
You can only run it on Cloud Hosted Router, CHR, or x86 installation.
To help you set up a CHR in a Virtual Box, please check our youtube tutorial, or Make your own x86 router.

## Configuration

## Container mode
Enable container mode:
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes
```
You will need to confirm the device-mode with a cold reboot if using the container on X86.

## Networking
Add veth interface for the container:
```
This guide demonstrates a basic example! The tests were performed in a local environment! This guide is meant for basic RADIUS "testing"
purposes! Not all "freeradius" features were tested!
```
```
/interface/veth/add name=veth3 address=172.17.0.2/24 gateway=172.17.0.1
```
Create a bridge for the container, assign an IP network to it, and add veth to the bridge:
```
/interface/bridge/add name=dockerfreeradius
/ip/address/add address=172.17.0.1/24 interface=dockerfreeradius
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=dockerfreeradius interface=veth3
```
Setup NAT for outgoing traffic if required:
```
/ip/firewall/nat/add chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=172.17.0.0/24
```
Getting image
To simplify the configuration, we will get the image from an external library but you can also import it via the .tar file.
Make sure that you have "Registry URL" set accordingly, limit RAM usage (if necessary), and set up a directory for the image:
```
/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=pull
```
Pull image with the help of the command:
```
/container/add remote-image=freeradius/freeradius-server:latest interface=veth3 root-dir=freeradius logging=yes
cmd="-X"
```
where cmd="-X" enables debug logging (per the "freeradius" documentation).
After running the command, RouterOS should start "extracting" the package. Check "File System" for newly created folders and monitor container status
with the command /container/print.
Starting the container
After you make sure that the container has been added and the status changed to status=stopped after using /container/print → you can initiate it:
```
/container/start 0
```
Altering the server's configuration files
To access the server's configuration files (clients.conf and authorize), we will need to use SFTP (file transfer over SSH) protocol, so make sure that SSH se
rvice is enabled.
Open your command terminal ("CMD", as Administrator, for Windows users, or "Linux Shell or Command Terminal" for Linux users) and navigate it to the
directory where you want to download the configuration files. For example, to "radius" folder on your "Desktop":
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\radius
```
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\radius>
```
Initiate SFTP to the device's IP address:
```
C:\Users\DenissPC\Desktop\radius>sftp admin@10.55.8.53
admin@10.55.8.53's password:
Connected to 10.55.8.53.
sftp>
```
Go to the server's configuration file folder (use dir or ls command to see the content of the folder you are in and cd command to go to the folder of our
choice).
The first file, "clients.conf" allows you to define RADIUS clients. Per the "freeradius" documentation, it should be under the "/etc/freeradius" directory...so,
navigate there and use get command to download it:
```
sftp> dir
freeradius pub pull skins
sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius
sftp> dir
README.rst certs clients.conf dictionary experimental.conf
hints
huntgroups mods-available mods-config mods-enabled panic.gdb policy.

/freeradius/etc/freeradius/clients.conf 100% 8323 1.2MB/s
00:00
```
Open "clients.conf" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other). You can study the file to see all the options that you have (additionally, check freer
adius.org). This example shows a basic setup, so, we will just overwrite the whole file with the lines shown below:
```
client new {
ipaddr = 0.0.0.0/0
secret = client_password
}
```
where we indicate, that our radius client can connect using any possible IP address (ipaddr=0.0.0.0/0 ensures that, but you also can change it to the actual
ip address/mask of your radius client if you require to do so) and that our secret is "client_password" (you can change it to any other secret).
Save the file/overwrite it.
The second file, "authorize" allows you to set up users. Per the "freeradius" documentation, it should be under "/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files". Go there
and get the file:
```
sftp> dir
freeradius pub pull skins
sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files
sftp> dir
accounting authorize dhcp pre-proxy
sftp> get authorize
Fetching /freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files/authorize to authorize
/freeradius/etc/freeradius/mods-config/files/authorize 100% 6594 1.1MB/s
00:00
```
Open "authorize" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other). This example shows a basic setup, so, we will just uncomment (remove the "#"
symbol from) the line shown below (leave the rest of the configuration/lines as they are):
```
bob Cleartext-Password := "hello"
```
which creates a username "bob" and sets the password to "hello" (you can change the username and password).
Save the file/overwrite it.
Upload both files back/overwrite the default files with the help of the put command:
```
sftp> dir
freeradius pub pull skins
sftp> cd freeradius/etc/freeradius
sftp> dir

```
Restart the container:
```
/container/stop 0
/container/start 0
```
Make sure to wait for the container to stop (status=stopped should be shown after using /container/print command) before initiating it again.
Result verification
In RouterOS, add a new RADIUS client configuration:
```
/radius/add service=login address=172.17.0.2 secret="client_password"
```
,where the address is the IP address of the veth3 interface, secret is the secret that we configured in the clients.conf file and service is the allowed
service that you wish to use.
Allow "login" with RADIUS users via the command:
```
/user/aaa/set use-radius=yes
```
We have allowed the "login" service for the RADIUS and we can test it using ssh/winbox/webfig connection. For SSH test, issue the command (where you
need to indicate the device's management IP and input bob's password "hello" after):
```
/system/ssh 10.55.8.53 user=bob
```
You should be able to verify, that the terminal user changed from "admin@MikroTik" to "bob@MikroTik":
```

## Introduction
The introduction of the container feature into the RouterOS made it possible to run all kinds of servers for all sorts of tasks inside the router. This is
especially relevant for people, who want to reduce the number of devices in their network. Instead of running a server on a separate device/machine, why
not run it inside the router?
In this guide, we will showcase how to install and host Home-Assistant server on RouterOS.
Home-Assistant is a very popular platform that is used to collect statistics from different sensors and supports different integrations.

## Summary
Make sure to study our container guide before proceeding with the configuration. Make sure to check the disclaimer and requirements sections to
understand all the risks and necessary steps you might be required to do.
You can find supported architectures by following the link.
At the time, when the guide was published, home-assistant image was available for ARM32, ARM64, and AMD64 (CHR and x86) devices.
Based on the information from their site, recommended minimal requirements are:
```
2 GB RAM
32 GB Storage
```
Recommended does not mean set in stone, and we will be running this on L009UiGS that has 512 MB RAM and a USB slot for the required storage. It is
advised using recommended hardware specifications, but for testing, and low amounts of data, you can get by with 512+ MB RAM.

## Container configuration
Sub-menu: /container
note: container package is required.

## Container mode
Enable container mode:
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes
```
You will need to confirm the device-mode with a press of the reset button, or a cold reboot, if using container on X86.

## Networking
Add veth interface:
```
/interface/veth/add name=veth2 address=172.19.0.2/24 gateway=172.19.0.1
```
Create a bridge for both containers and add veth interfaces to it:
```
/interface/bridge/add name=ha
/ip/address/add address=172.19.0.1/24 interface=ha
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=ha interface=veth2
```
Forward TCP 8123 for home-assistant management (where 192.168.88.1 is the device's LAN IP address) if NAT is required (optional):
```
/ip firewall nat add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.88.1 dst-port=8123 protocol=tcp to-
addresses=172.19.0.2 to-ports=8123
```
Environment variables and mounts
Per the home-assist documentation, define mounts for the configuration files (where, /usb1 is our external USB storage folder):
```
/container mounts add dst=/config name=ha_config src=/usb1/ha_config
```
Create an environmental variable for home-assistant:
```
/container envs add key=TZ name=ha_env value=America/Los_Angeles
```
Getting image
To simplify the configuration, we will get the images from an external library.
Make sure that you have "Registry URL" set accordingly, limit RAM usage (if necessary), and set up a directory for the images:
```
/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=/usb1/pull
```
Pull home-assistant image and wait for it to be extracted:
```
/container/add remote-image=homeassistant/home-assistant:latest interface=veth2 root-dir=/usb1/ha
mounts=ha_config envlist=ha_env logging=yes
```
After running the command, RouterOS should start "extracting" the package. Check "File System" for newly created folders and monitor container status
with the command /container/print.
Starting the container
After you make sure that the container has been added and the status changed to status=stopped after using /container/print → you can initiate it:
```
/container/start 0
```
Home-Assistant setup
Open your preferred web browser and access the Home-Assistant management portal by specifying management port ":8123":
Proceed with the setup. More information is explained in the Home-Assistant onboarding guide.
Resources
Just running the Home Assistant on L009 (without any load/traffic) takes up ~300 MB of RAM:
```
/system resource print
uptime: 4m27s
version: 7.13.3 (stable)
build-time: Jan/24/2024 13:16:46
factory-software: 7.10
free-memory: 143.0MiB
total-memory: 448.0MiB
cpu: ARM
```
With the load, it will increase, but for testing, on this specific board, it should be enough.

## Introduction
The introduction of the container feature into the RouterOS made it possible to run all kinds of servers for all sorts of tasks inside the router. This is
especially relevant for people, who want to reduce the number of devices in their network. Instead of running a server on a separate device/machine, why
not run it inside the router?
In this guide, we will showcase how to install a basic MQTT broker (or in other words, server) called eclipse-mosquitto. MQTT protocol is a very popular
choice, especially in IoT topologies. It is an open OASIS and ISO standard lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages
between devices. A typical topology consists of an MQTT publisher (a device that sends information), an MQTT broker (a server where the data is stored),
and an MQTT subscriber (a device that listens to the data published on the server).
RouterOS supports MQTT publish, subscribe feature, and, now, we can also run the MQTT broker as well.
The image that we are going to use, can be found by following the hub.docker link.

## Summary
Make sure to study our container guide before proceeding with the configuration. Make sure to check the disclaimer and requirements sections to
understand all the risks and necessary steps you might be required to do.
You can find supported architectures by following the link.
At the time, when the guide was published, eclipse-mosquitto image was available for ARM32, ARM64, and AMD64 (CHR and x86) devices. In this
example, we will run it on an ARM32 architecture device → RB1100AHx4.

## Container configuration
Sub-menu: /container
note: container package is required.

## Container mode
Enable container mode:
```
A very basic and quick configuration will be shown. Make sure to check mosquitto documentation page for more information about additional
options and settings you can implement. If you want to use it for production, please make sure to harden the security in any way possible:
```
```
Firewall, so that access to the container is allowed only from your trusted IP addresses;
Increasing security from the mosquitto broker/server-side → use strong passwords, non-standard ports ...etc;
Use SSL MQTT.
```
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes
```
You will need to confirm the device-mode with a press of the reset button, or a cold reboot, if using container on X86.
Networking
Add veth interface for the container:
```
/interface/veth/add name=veth2 address=172.19.0.2/24 gateway=172.19.0.1
```
Create a bridge for containers and add veth to it:
```
/interface/bridge/add name=msqt
/ip/address/add address=172.19.0.1/24 interface=msqt
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=msqt interface=veth2
```
Forward TCP 1883 for non-SSL MQTT (where 192.168.88.1 is the device's LAN IP address) for testing purposes if NAT is required (optional):
```
/ip firewall nat add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.88.1 dst-port=1883 protocol=tcp to-
addresses=172.19.0.2 to-ports=1883
```
Environment variables and mounts
Per the eclipse-mosquitto docker hub, define a mount for the configuration file. We will mount not just the configuration file, but the whole folder, because,
for SSL MQTT, we will need to upload certificates into the folder as well:
```
/container mounts add src=/mosquitto_mounted dst=/mosquitto/config name=msqt_config
```
Getting image
To simplify the configuration, we will get the image from an external library but you can also import it via the .tar file.
In this example, we will use the device's own storage. RB1100AHx4 has 128 MB disk space and a basic mosquitto installation should not take up more
than ~15 MB.
Make sure that you have "Registry URL" set accordingly, limit RAM usage (if necessary), and set up a directory for the image:
```
/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=pull
```
Pull image:
```
/container/add remote-image=eclipse-mosquitto:latest interface=veth2 root-dir=mosquitto mounts=msqt_config
logging=yes
```
After running the command, RouterOS should start "extracting" the package. Check "File System" for newly created folders and monitor container status
with the command /container/print.
Setting up mosquitto configuration file
To get the mosquttio.conf file, we will need to use SFTP (file transfer over SSH) protocol, so make sure that SSH service is enabled. You can also use FTP.
Open your command terminal ("CMD", as Administrator, for Windows users, or "Linux Shell or Command Terminal" for Linux users) and navigate it to the
directory where you want to download the configuration file. For example, to the "Container" folder on your "Desktop":
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container
```
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container>
```
Initiate SFTP to the device's IP address:
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container>sftp admin@192.168.88.1
The authenticity of host '192.168.88.1 (192.168.88.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:lfxxs+xMrXlvP7hiHi9ZAEZlPi6/c5US+r6J7ljhkaA.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.88.1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Connected to 192.168.88.1.
sftp>
```
Go to the mosquitto configuration file folder (use dir or ls command to see the content of the folder you are in and cd command to go to the folder of our
choice). By default, the configuration is loaded from the "/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf", so, navigate there and use get command to download it:
```
sftp> cd mosquitto/mosquitto/config
sftp> dir
mosquitto.conf
sftp> get mosquitto.conf
Fetching /mosquitto/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf to mosquitto.conf
/mosquitto/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
```
Open "mosquitto.conf" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other), and just overwrite it with two lines shown below:
```
listener 1883
allow_anonymous true
```
```
The first line, listener 1883, will make the installation listen for incoming network connection on the specified port.
The second line, allow_anonymous true, determines whether clients that connect without providing a username are allowed to connect.
```
Overwrite the file using the same mosquitto.conf name.
After you have created your own custom configuration file, upload it into the mounted directory/folder "mosquitto_mounted". If you have not run the
container yet, you will not have the "mosquitto_mounted" folder and you can create it manually. If you did run it (/container start 0), it should have
been created automatically:
```
sftp> dir
mosquitto mosquitto_mounted pub pull skins
```
Use SFTP from the directory where the edited mosquitto.conf file is located and put it into the mounted directory:
```
In this section, we will configure a basic non-SSL MQTT setup for testing purposes. Non-SSL MQTT is not secure for a production environment
unless you are certain the required security/restrictions are in place.
```
```
For a production environment, topologies where the MQTT traffic can be captured/sniffed and/or topologies where the MQTT traffic is routed
directly via the internet (not locally), use SSL MQTT. Check the SSL MQTT section for more information.

Restart the container:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /container/stop 0
[admin@MikroTik] > /container/start 0
```
Make sure to wait for the container to stop (status=stopped should be shown after using /container/print command) before initiating it again.
Starting the container
After you make sure that the container has been added and the status changed to status=stopped after using /container/print → you can initiate it:
```
/container/start 0
```
If you have enabled container logging, you would see something like this in the Logs section:
```
12:12:46 container,info,debug 1707214366: mosquitto version 2.0.18 starting
12:12:46 container,info,debug 1707214366: Config loaded from /mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf.

```
MQTT publish and subscribe
Sub-menu: /iot mqtt
note: iot package is required.
Add an MQTT broker:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=mosquitto username=test address=172.19.0.2
```
Subscribe to the MQTT broker and the required topic:
```
/iot/mqtt/subscribe broker=mosquitto topic=test/topic
```
Publish a static MQTT message:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="mosquitto" topic="test/topic" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
Check subscriptions for received messages:
```
/iot/mqtt/subscriptions/recv/print
0 broker=mosquitto topic="test/topic" data="{"test":"123"}"
time=2023-07-12 10:01:40
```
You can also check the container logs (if enabled), to confirm the mosquitto is operational:
```
12:47:28 container,info,debug 1675421248: New connection from 172.19.0.1:42240 on port 1883.
12:47:28 container,info,debug 1675421248: New client connected from 172.19.0.1:42240 as MTD8580EC793C4 (p2,
c1, k60, u'test').
12:47:38 container,info,debug 1675421258: Client MTD8580EC793C4 disconnected.
```
SSL MQTT
Using non-SSL MQTT for a production environment is not secure. One can easily capture/sniff the packet exchange between the broker and the publisher
and, as a result, will be able to obtain user credentials and other sensitive information.
To increase security, use SSL MQTT.
The first step is to generate the certificates. In this example, we will use a simple Root CA scenario (with no device/client certificate requirement).
Use the official mosquitto-tls user guide for the step-by-step.
Server configuration
You should have generated ca.crt (Certificate Authority file), server.crt (server certificate) and server.key (server's key):
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container>dir
Directory of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container
```
```
07/12/2023 10:58 AM <DIR>.
07/12/2023 10:58 AM <DIR> ..

6 File(s) 7,039 bytes
2 Dir(s) 52,401,184,768 bytes free
```
Open mounted "mosquitto.conf" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other), and just overwrite it with the lines shown below:
```
tls_version tlsv1.2
port 8883
allow_anonymous true
cafile /mosquitto/config/ca.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/server.key
certfile /mosquitto/config/server.crt
```
```
tls_version line sets minimal TLS version;
listener 8883, will make the installation listen for incoming network connection on the specified port;
allow_anonymous true, determines whether clients that connect without providing a username are allowed to connect;
```
```
cafile /mosquitto/config/ca.crt line specifies a path to the CA certificate file;
keyfile /mosquitto/config/server.key line specifies a path to the server key file;
certfile /mosquitto/config/server.crt line specifies a path to the server certificate file.
```
Upload the certificate files, and updated SSL-ready mosquitto.conf file into the mounted folder "mosquitto_mounted":
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Container>sftp admin@192.168.88.1

```
Confirm that the broker listens on port 8883 using the logs:
```

11:22:24 system,info,account user admin logged in from 10.5.217.34 via local
```
Testing the connection
Upload CA certificate (ca.crt) into RouterOS, into the device's "File List":
```
/file print

6 ca.crt .crt file 1322 2023-07-12 11:28:23
```
```
We are using a basic SSL configuration for testing purposes. allow_anonymous true is not a secure setting for the production environment.
```
Import the certificate:
```
/certificate/import file-name=ca.crt passphrase=""
```
Add MQTT broker for SSL connection:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=mosquittoSSL username=test address=172.19.0.2 port=8883 ssl=yes
```
Subscribe to the MQTT broker and the required topic:

## Introduction
The introduction of the container feature into the RouterOS made it possible to run all kinds of servers for all sorts of tasks inside the router. This is
especially relevant for people, who want to reduce the number of devices in their network. Instead of running a server on a separate device/machine, why
not run it inside the router?
A lot of users need a server that is able to gather the data, store it and display it in a way it is easy to understand. This is where a platform like ThingsBoard
can come into play.
It is primarily positioned as an IoT platform and you can find all sorts of use cases for it that they demonstrate in the link.
The most appealing part, from the RouterOS user standpoint, is that it can be used as an MQTT server (MQTT broker) or an HTTP server. Meaning, you
can use MQTT publish or HTTP post to post the data. You can find ThingsBoard MQTT API guide by using the link here and HTTP API by using the link he
re.
In short, you can utilize scripting to collect RouterOS statistics (like uptime, GPS coordinates, packet statistics, and almost anything else that you print into
the terminal), then store this information into variables and structure a JSON message out of those. You can, then send this message using MQTT or
HTTP post to the ThingsBoard via a scheduler (that will run this script whenever you need it). You can find an example of a basic script that does it in this
guide.
ThingsBoard will store and display the data with the help of widgets, which can be used to help you set up dashboards that visualize the data in graphs,
tables, maps, and other ways.
There are 3 versions of the ThingsBoard instances available and each of them uses a different database:
```
thingsboard/tb-postgres
thingsboard/tb-cassandra
thingsboard/tb
```
You can find more information in the ThingsBoard/docker documentation.
In our example, we will showcase tb-postgres - a single instance of ThingsBoard with PostgreSQL database.

## Summary
Sub-menu: /container
note: container package is required.
RouterOS versions that are older than v7.8 will not be able to run this scenario.
Make sure to study our container guide before proceeding with the configuration. Make sure to check the disclaimer and requirements sections to
understand all the risks and necessary steps you might be required to do.
In this example, we will run it on a Cloud Hosted Router, CHR device. To help you set it up in a Virtual Box, please check our youtube tutorial.
At the time, when the guide was published, thingsboard/tb-postgres image was available for linux/arm64 and linux/amd64 OS/architectures only. Meaning,
you are not able to run this scenario on our arm32-bit architecture RouterOS devices.
There are a couple of parameters to keep in mind:
```
You need to understand that it is a server and that you will need to have additional space for the data that is stored there and the image itself. In
our tests, 8 GB of disk space was plenty enough but! you might want to consider adding more for real-life applications, especially if you are
planning on running more containers. Just remember → it might be better to have a reserve.
Same as with disk space, RAM memory is also important. Per the ThingsBoard documentation, when using a single instance of ThingsBoard with
a PostgreSQL database, it is recommended to allocate at least 1GB of RAM and use a minimum load (a few messages per second). 2-4GB RAM
is recommended. In other words, if you want to run it on a RouterBoard device, please understand, that you might not be able to achieve it on
devices that have less than 1 GB RAM. That is why → consider having a device with more RAM memory to spare.
```
Go to the tips and tricks section to understand how to limit RAM.
Configuration
Container mode
Enable container mode:
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes
```
You will need to confirm the device-mode with a press of the reset button, or a cold reboot, if using container on X86.
Networking
Add veth interface for the container:
```
/interface/veth/add name=veth1 address=172.18.0.2/24 gateway=172.18.0.1
```
Create a bridge for the container, assign an IP network to it, and add veth to the bridge:
```
/interface/bridge/add name=dockertb
/ip/address/add address=172.18.0.1/24 interface=dockertb
/interface/bridge/port add bridge=dockertb interface=veth1
```
Setup NAT for outgoing traffic:
```
/ip/firewall/nat/add chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=172.18.0.0/24
```
Forward TCP 9090 for HTTP management (the default HTTP port per ThingsBoard documentation):
```
/ip firewall nat add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.88.1 dst-port=9090 protocol=tcp to-
addresses=172.18.0.2 to-ports=9090
```
```
We suggest using HTTP access only when testing locally or through a VPN (when you are certain that the local network is safe).
```
```
When you want to access container WEB management from the internet (from the public network/WAN), please, instead, consider using HTTPS.
```
In the dst-address field shown in DNAT (dst-nat) rule above, we use the device's local IP address. First, use local IPs (local access) to set everything up
and confirm that everything is working.
Forward TCP 1883 for non-SSL MQTT (the default MQTT port used per ThingsBoard documentation):
```
/ip firewall nat add action=dst-nat chain=dstnat dst-address=192.168.88.1 dst-port=1883 protocol=tcp to-
addresses=172.18.0.2 to-ports=1883
```
Same as with HTTP access, in the dst-address field shown in DNAT (dst-nat) rule above, we use the device's local IP address. First, use local IPs (local
access) to set everything up and confirm that everything is working.
Environment variables and mounts
Check docker-thingsboard documentation for exact mounts and variables that need to be added.
Environment variables:
```
/container/envs/add name=tb_envs key=TB_QUEUE_TYPE value="in-memory"
```
Mounts:
```
/container/mounts/add name=mytb-data src=tb/mytb-data dst=/data
/container/mounts/add name=mytb-logs src=tb/mytb-logs dst=/var/log/thingsboard
```
```
After going through the rest of the steps shown in this guide and verifying that the ThingsBoard management portal works locally →  further
secure the setup:
```
```
(a) make sure that all default ThingsBoard user credentials were changed/removed and strong passwords were implemented
(reference ThingsBoard documentation);
(b) enable HTTPS (the steps will be explained later on in the guide);
(c) preferably change HTTPS port to a non-standard one (reference ThingsBoard documentation).
```
```
Only when you increase the security and only then →  you can consider enabling remote access from WAN (by using your public IP address in
the dst-address field instead of the local IP used in the example above). Additionally, to further increase security, use src-address or src-
address-list parameter, where you can input your trusted public source IP addresses (a list of known/trusted addresses that, for example,
belong to your branch office from where you also want to have access to the server). Please understand that only you are responsible for the
security. If you leave a door open, someone may exploit it. You need to have networking knowledge and understand the risks when setting up
such scenarios.
```
```
We suggest using non-SSL MQTT (TCP 1883) communication only when testing locally or through a VPN (when you are certain that the local
network is safe).
```
```
Please consider using SSL MQTT (TCP port 8883), instead of non-SSL MQTT (TCP port 1883), for real-life applications, when it comes down to
access from the internet (from the public network). If you use non-SSL MQTT, the communication between the client (MQTT publisher) and the
server (MQTT broker) can be easily sniffed/packet captured, and that will compromise authentication data (such as client-ids, usernames and
passwords).
```
```
After going through the rest of the steps shown in this guide and verifying that the ThingsBoard non-SSL MQTT communication works locally →  f
urther secure the setup:
```
```
(a) consider removing template devices from the ThingsBoard installation;
(b) enable SSL MQTT (the steps will be explained later on in the guide);
(c) preferably change MQTT port to a non-standard one (reference ThingsBoard documentation).
```
```
When you enable SSL MQTT, you can consider opening TCP 8883 (which is the default SSL MQTT port) from WAN (by using your public IP
address in the dst-address field instead of the local IP, and changing dst-port and to-ports from 1883 to 8883). Additionally, to further
increase security, use src-address or src-address-list parameters, where you can set up your trusted public IP address list. As a result,
only configured trusted IPs will be able to establish an MQTT connection with the ThingsBoard broker.
```
Getting image
To simplify the configuration, we will get the image from an external library but you can also import it via the .tar file.
Make sure that you have "Registry URL" set accordingly, limit RAM usage (if necessary), and set up a directory for the image.
```
/container/config/set registry-url=https://registry-1.docker.io tmpdir=pull ram-high=2048.0MiB
```
Pull image:
```
/container/add remote-image=thingsboard/tb-postgres:latest interface=veth1 root-dir=ThingsBoard mounts=mytb-
data,mytb-logs envlist=tb_envs logging=yes
```
After running the command, RouterOS should start "extracting" the package. Check "File System" for newly created folders and monitor container status
with the command /container/print.
Starting the container
After you make sure that the container has been added and the status changed to status=stopped after using /container/print → you can initiate it:
```
/container/start 0
```
Wait for a couple of minutes for the container to fully load.
Verification
Management access
After the container is started and installed, access it using any browser, by going to → [http://192.168.88.1:9090](http://192.168.88.1:9090) (where the IP address is the address used
in the DNAT rule):
By default, credentials are (Username/Password):
```
Systen Administrator: sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin
Tenant Administrator: tenant@thingsboard.org / tenant
```
The login prompt should confirm that the server is running.
MQTT test
Log in with the tenant and create a new device. Go to the "Devices" menu, click on the "+" (Add Device) button and choose the "Add new device" option:
Name it, however, you like, and click on "Add":
Check your device access token by clicking on the device you've just created and selecting the "Manage credentials" setting (copy the access token
generated or type in your own →  "YOUR_TOKEN"):
After these steps, go to the RouterOS settings (back to CHR settings) and create a new MQTT broker (make sure that you have IoT package installed beca
use otherwise, you will not have this menu):
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tb address=172.18.0.2 port=1883 username=YOUR_TOKEN
```
Publish a static test MQTT message in the JSON format:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="tb" topic="v1/devices/me/telemetry" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
Confirm that the message was posted:
Enabling HTTPS and SSL MQTT
By default, HTTP and MQTT protocols are used. As mentioned previously in the "Networking" section, working with non-SSL HTTP and non-SSL MQTT is
not very safe (unless they are used within heavily protected networks with a well-configured firewall/restricted access) and we advise enabling HTTPS and
SSL MQTT.
Please check ThingsBoard documentation for more information → HTTP over SSL and MQTT over SSL guides.
First of all, there is no SSL without a certificate and one needs to be made (or purchased).
In short, this section will demonstrate how to generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS and SSL MQTT. Then, you will need to upload them to the correct
folder within the ThingsBoard installation and alter the ThingsBoard configuration file accordingly.
In our guide, we will use RouterOS to generate both certificates (but you can also use OpenSSL or other tools you want).
Create certificates
Create a certificate for HTTPS:
```
/certificate add name=TBhttps common-name=172.18.0.2
/certificate sign TBhttps
```
Create a certificate for MQTT:
```
/certificate add name=TBmqtt common-name=172.18.0.2
/certificate sign TBmqtt
```
Confirm that they were added with the help of /certificate/print command:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /certificate/print
Flags: K - PRIVATE-KEY; A - AUTHORITY; T - TRUSTED
Columns: NAME, COMMON-NAME, FINGERPRINT
# NAME COMMON-NAME FINGERPRINT
0 KAT TBhttps 172.18.0.2 863f4547c74ce3ec70c3e82172502711517b52bbc055d18c24ba4aafec46152c
1 KAT TBmqtt 172.18.0.2 ebf3ff5d03ed4cc73546e058da9bc414cdaf24ce45da29b203348045fbbd21ae
```
Export the certificates using PKCS12 format and set up a password/passphrase for them:
```
/certificate/export-certificate file-name=keystore export-passphrase=thingsboard_cert_password type=pkcs12
numbers=0
/certificate/export-certificate file-name=mqttserver export-passphrase=thingsboard_mqttcert_password
type=pkcs12 numbers=1
```
Use your own export-passphrase and remember them.
The output from the command above will create certificate keystore.p12 and mqttserver.p12 files that you can download from the "File List" menu:
```

```
Download both files from the router into any directory on your PC. For example, we've downloaded it into C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard
folder.
Download the ThingsBoard's configuration file
Open your command terminal ("CMD", as Administrator, for Windows users, or "Linux Shell or Command Terminal" for Linux users) and navigate it to the
directory where the certificates are:
```
C:\Windows\System32>cd c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard
C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard>dir
Directory of C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard
```
```

2 File(s) 4 882 bytes
2 Dir(s) 51 380 154 368 bytes free
```
From this directory, you will need to connect to the router's IP via the SFTP (which allows you to file transfer using SSH protocol, so you need to make sure
that SSH service is enabled beforehand):
```
c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard>sftp admin@192.168.88.1
The authenticity of host '192.168.88.1 (192.168.88.1)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?yes
admin@192.168.88.1's password:
Connected to 192.168.88.1.
sftp>
```
While the container is running, go to the ThingsBoard configuration file folder (use dir or ls command to see the content of the folder you are in and cd
command to go to the folder of our choice). By default, it should be the folder with the "thingsboard.yml" configuration file in it. In our example, we could
locate it under:
```
sftp> cd ThingsBoard\usr\share\thingsboard\conf
```
```
sftp> dir
```
```
banner.txt i18n logback.xml templates thingsboard.conf thingsboard.
yml
```
Download the "thingsboard.yml" configuration using get command. This will download the default ThingsBoard configuration file to your machine (to the
directory from where you initiated SFTP):

Alter the ThingsBoard's settings
Open "thingsboard.yml" via your preferred text editor (notepad or any other), and alter a few lines. You can backup this file and save it with a different
name to have a copy of the default settings, in case, of misconfiguration.
HTTPS-related settings:
```
Enable SSL →  Change "SSL_ENABLED:false" to "SSL_ENABLED:true";
Change credentials type → from "SSL_CREDENTIALS_TYPE:PEM" to "SSL_CREDENTIALS_TYPE:KEYSTORE";
Change the path → from "SSL_KEY_STORE:classpath:keystore/keystore.p12" to "SSL_KEY_STORE:keystore.p12" (optional);
Disable key alias setting → comment it → just put the "#" symbol in front of the key_alias: "${SSL_KEY_ALIAS:tomcat}" line;
Input your own certificate password that was used in RouterOS → from "SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD:thingsboard" to
"SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD:thingsboard_cert_password" and from "SSL_KEY_PASSWORD:thingsboard" to "SSL_KEY_PASSWORD:things
board_cert_password".
```

```
Apply the changes to the "thingsboard.yml" file (re-save it after editing).
Upload altered ThingsBoard configuration file
All that is left is to overwrite the current configuration file with an altered file and upload both certificates.
Once again, make sure your terminal is pointing to the right folder (where 3 files are located → both certificates and an altered "thingsboard.yml" file), and,
from there, SFTP into the container's configuration file directory:
```
c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\ThingsBoard>dir

Restart the container:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /container/stop 0
[admin@MikroTik] > /container/start 0
```
Make sure to wait for the container to stop (status=stopped should be shown after using /container/print command) before initiating it again.
Confirm HTTPS access
Now, you should be able to access https://your_IP:9090 (where the IP address is the address used in the DNAT rule):
```
Since we are using a self-signed certificate that was not issued by a trusted authority →  an error indicating that the connection is not secure
might appear but you can view the certificate through the browser (confirm it is the one), accept the risk, and continue.
```
Confirm SSL MQTT connection
In this example, we will test a one-way SSL communication access token scenario.
Testing with the device that is running the container
Add MQTT broker:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tbssl address=172.18.0.2 port=8883 username=YOUR_TOKEN ssl=yes
```
Publish a static test MQTT message in the JSON format:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="tbssl" topic="v1/devices/me/telemetry" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
Confirm that it was received by the MQTT broker:
Testing with another device
When you have two RouterOS devices, one that is running the container (and, in our example, is the same device that generated the certificate) and the
other one that you wish to test the MQTT connection from (let's say, an LTAP or any other RouterOS device with IoT package installed) → you will need to
import the certificate to the second device.
Drag and drop the exported certificate (mqttserver.p12) into the device's "File List":
```
[admin@LTAP] > /file/print
Columns: NAME, TYPE, SIZE, CREATION-TIME
# NAME TYPE SIZE CREATION-TIME
0 mqttserver.p12 .p12 file 2438 jan/30/2023 13:28:11
1 flash disk jul/06/2021 14:51:53
2 flash/pub directory jul/06/2021 14:51:53
3 flash/skins directory jan/01/1970 02:00:07
[admin@LTAP] >
```
Import the certificate:
```
[admin@LTAP] > /certificate/import file-name=mqttserver.p12 passphrase=thingsboard_mqttcert_password
```
```
Do not forget to alter the port forwarding rule that is shown in the "Networking" section by changing dst-port and to-ports from 1883
(standard non-SSL MQTT port) to 8883 (SSL MQTT port).
```
```
MQTT certificate should already be installed into the device's system (because it is the device that generated it).
```
Add MQTT broker, where the address is the IP address "dst-address" that is used in the TCP 8883 port-forwarding rule on the ThingsBoard-container
router:
```
/iot/mqtt/brokers/add name=tbssl address=192.168.88.1 port=8883 username=YOUR_TOKEN ssl=yes
```
Publish a static test MQTT message in the JSON format:
```
/iot/mqtt/publish broker="tbssl" topic="v1/devices/me/telemetry" message="{\"test\":\"123\"}"
```
And confirm that the broker received it → under the "Latest Telemetry" section on the ThingsBoard.


# DLNA Media server
DLNA is a set of protocols that enables networked devices to share digital media, including videos, photos, and music. Central to the operation of DLNA is
the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) architecture, which facilitates the discovery and control of network devices.
DLNA and UPnP work in tandem to provide a seamless media sharing experience. UPnP supports device discovery and control on the network through
protocols like the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) and others such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for control messages and XML for
device and service descriptions. In the context of DLNA, UPnP serves as the foundation, allowing various devices like TVs, computers, and mobile devices
to connect and share media content efficiently.
In RouterOS, enable the media server and share movies or music with your household media devices, such as TVs or player apps in your PC, such as the
popular VLC.

## Server settings
```
Property Description
```
```
allowed-hostname To restrict access to specific hostnames.
```
```
allowed-ip To limit access to specified IP addresses
```
```
friendly-name The name that will be displayed for the DLNA server on the network.
```
```
interface Specifies the network interface that the DLNA server will use
```
```
path The file path where the media content is stored and will be served from.
```
```
disabled Specifies if entry is disabled
```

## Configuration examples
Creating a DLNA server
```
/ip media add friendly-name=Mikrotik interface=bridge1 path=usb1
```
Creating multiple DLNA servers with limitations. Usage example - Limit children's TV access only to child-friendly media, located in folder "usb1/kids"
```
/ip media add friendly-name=adults interface=bridge1 path=usb1/adults allowed-hostname=ADULTS_TV
/ip media add friendly-name=kids interface=bridge1 path=usb1/kids allowed-hostname=KIDS_TV
```
```
Media (DLNA) is not supported on SMIPS devices

```
Configuration example (RAID6):
This is an example on how to configure RAID, it will be the same procedure in most of RAID types
Create the RAID block device (In this example, RAID 6)
```
add raid-device-count=20 raid-type=6 slot=raid1 type=raid
```
Add drives to this raid
```
set nvme1 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0

Format the RAID block device
```
disk> format-drive raid1 file-system=btrfs
```
And the result should look similar to this
```
RouterOS supports software RAID levels 0,1,4,5,6,linear and nested RAID.
```
```

```
RAID 0
All data is written evenly over all disks in this RAID, this configuration does not provide any fault tolerance but provides best performance.
RAID 1
Same data is written in all drives (data is mirrored), this configuration provides best fault tolerance, but performance wise write speeds will be equal to
slowest disk used in array.
RAID 4
Block-level data is striped to a dedicated disk where parity bits are stored. Performance will be limited to a parity writing speed.
RAID 5
Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. Can be recovered from 1 disk failure.
RAID 6
Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. Can be recovered from 2 disk failures.
RAID Linear
Data is appended over multiple disks combining them into single large disk. Provides no redundancy and is limited to single disk read/write speed.
Nested RAID
Combination of multiple RAID configurations into other RAID. For example RAID 10 (RAID 1+0) combines disk mirroring (RAID 1) and disk striping (RAID
0)
Configuration example
In this example I'm using 20 SSD drives and configuring in RAID (RAID 1+0)
Create a RAID 1 block
```
add raid-device-count=2 raid-type=1 slot=raid10 type=raid
```
Crete two RAID 0 blocks and add them to set the master-raid the previously created RAID 1 block (name=raid10)
```
add raid-device-count=10 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=0 raid-type=0 slot=raid0 type=raid
add raid-device-count=10 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=1 raid-type=0 slot=raid1 type=raid
```
Add drives to each RAID block
```
set nvme1 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0
set nvme2 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=1
set nvme3 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=2
set nvme4 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=3
set nvme5 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=4
set nvme6 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=5
set nvme7 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=6
set nvme8 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=7
set nvme9 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=8
set nvme10 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=9
```
```
set nvme11 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=0
set nvme12 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=1
set nvme13 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=2
set nvme14 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=3
set nvme15 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=4
set nvme16 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=5
set nvme17 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=6
set nvme18 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=7
set nvme19 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=8
set nvme20 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=9
```
After this format, the raid10 block
```
format-drive raid10 file-system=btrfs
```
After formating you should see the free space and use the block
```

```
RSYNC
rsync (Remote Sync) is a powerful file synchronization and file transfer program used in Unix-based systems. It allows for efficient transfer and
synchronization of files and directories between different systems or within the same system.
If you make changes in a file only changes to files are transferred, reducing data transfer volume. RouterOS RSYNC implementation uses ipsec for data
transfer (if password is set). When configured you will see dynamic ipsec entries.
Rsync settings can be found in file/sync menu
IPSec dynamic entry example:
```
Port TCP/8291 is used for the control connection (if not open in the status (file sync print) you will be stuck at making control connection to 192.1
68.88.2)
```
```
Port UDP/500 and protocol 50 (ipsec-esp) is used to create a secure connection and start the transfer (if not open in the status (file sync print)
you will be stuck at initializing transfer)
```

### # PEER TUNNEL SRC-ADDRESS DST-ADDRESS PROTOCOL ACTION LEVEL PH2-COUNT
```
;;; file-sync-10.155.145.11

```
Properties
```
Property Description
```
```
local-path File/folder path. Used for mode Upload to set the path of the file/folder to upload to the device
```
```
mode Sets if you want to download/upload the file (direction of the sync)
```
```
password Target device password
```
```
remote-address Target devices IP
```
```
remote-path File/folder path. Used with mode download to set the path of the target device to be downloaded
```
```
user Target device password
```
Configuration example
Basic configuration is really easy, on the host device you need to add the file you want to sync to another device, the ip, user/password and the mode.
```
/file sync
add local-path=/ipv6route.txt.rsc mode=upload remote-address=192.168.88.2 remote-path=RAID/
```
If configured correctly, you will see on the host device:
```
0 192.168.88.2 upload /ipv6route.txt.rsc RAID/ in sync
```
And on the client device:

### # REMOTE-ADDRESS MODE LOCAL-PATH REMOTE-PATH STATUS
```
0 D 192.168.88.1 download RAID/ /ipv6route.txt.rsc in sync
```
Self-Encryption Drives

# UPS

## Summary
Sub-menu: /system ups
Standards: APC Smart Protocol
The UPS monitor feature works with APC UPS units that support “smart” signalling over serial RS232 or USB connection. The UPS monitor service is not
included in the default set of packages so it needs to be downloaded and installed manually with ups.npk package. This feature enables the network
administrator to monitor the UPS and set the router to ‘gracefully’ handle any power outage with no corruption or damage to the router. The basic purpose
of this feature is to ensure that the router will come back online after an extended power failure. To do this, the router will monitor the UPS and set itself to
hibernate mode when the utility power is down and the UPS battery has less than 10% of its battery power left. The router will then continue to monitor the
UPS (while in hibernate mode) and then restart itself when the utility power returns. If the UPS battery is drained and the router loses all power, the router
will power back to full operation when the ‘utility’ power returns.
The UPS monitor feature on the MikroTik RouterOS supports
```
hibernate and safe reboot on power and battery failure
UPS battery test and run time calibration test
monitoring of all "smart" mode status information supported by UPS
logging of power changes
```

## Connecting the UPS unit
The serial APC UPS (BackUPS Pro or SmartUPS) requires a special serial cable (unless connected with USB). If no cable came with the UPS, a cable
may be ordered from APC or one can be made "in-house". Use the following diagram:
```
Router Side (DB9f) Signal Direction UPS Side (DB9m)
```
```
2 Receive IN 2
```
```
3 Send OUT 1
```
```
5 Ground 4
```
```
7 CTS IN 6
```
If using a RouterBOARD device, make sure to set your "RouterBOOT setup key" to Delete instead of the default Any key. This is to avoid accidental
opening of the setup menu if the UPS unit sends some data to the serial port during RouterBOARD startup. This can be done in the RouterBOOT options
during boot time or via the RouterBoard Settings in Winbox :
Select key which will enter setup on boot:
* 1 - any key
2 - <Delete> key only
your choice:

## General Properties
```
Property Description

# Wake on LAN

## Introduction
Sub-menu: /tool wol
The Wake on LAN tool can send a UDP Magic Packet to the Broadcast address with a selected MAC address embedded in it.
If the target device supports Wake on LAN (a target computer has specific hardware and software requirements for the Wake on LAN feature to work), it
should wake up from sleep or shutdown state.
Currently, secure WoL is not supported.



# IP packing

## Overview
IP Packing provides packet packaging service on network links. It allows simple packet aggregation into larger packets and compression of the contents of
packets.

## Requirements
Packet packing is part of the system package and has to have a discovery protocol enabled on an interface.

## Configuration
```
/ip packing
```
It required to have a configuration in two places, both routers should be set up symmetrically:
```
/ip packing - to enable packet aggregation and/or compression on an interface
/ip neighbor discovery- to enable discovery protocol on the interface
```

## Packing configuration
```
Property Description
```
```
aggregated-size (20 .. 16384 default: 1500 ) size of an aggregated packet that packing will try to achieve before sending a packet over the
network
```
```
disabled (yes|no) state of packing rule, if a value is yes it will be ignored and will not be part of the active configuration
```
```
interface (interface name) packing will try to aggregate and/or compress packets from this interface
```
```
packing (simple|compress-all|compress-
headers|none)
```
```
the action it should perform when a packet is leaving the interface packing rule is configured:
```
```
simple - do just aggregate packets
compress-all - do aggregation and attempt to compress headers and payload of a packet
compress-headers - do aggregation and attempt to compress headers and leave the
payload of a packet as is
none - send packets as is
```
```
unpacking (simple|compress-all|compress-
headers|none)
```
```
the action should be performed when a packet is received on the interface packing rule is configured
on:
```
```
simple - unpack received packets from aggregated packets received from the interface
compress-all - unpack aggregated packet and uncompress headers and payload of a packet
compress-headers - unpack aggregated packets and decompress headers of a packet
none - do nothing with a received packet
```

## Example
```
The router should be seen as a neighbor of the router over the interface you want to enable packing on. If in the neighbor list there is no entry
indicating packing, packing is not working!
```
```
Packing may increase latency on the link it is configured on.
```
Router-A and Router-B are connected with cable with interface ether1 on Router-A and ether3 on Router-B. This example will aggregate packets coming
from Router-A, but will leave packets from Router-B intact On Router-A:
Make sure discovery is enabled:
```
/ip neighbor discovery set ether1 discover=yes
```
Add packing rule for the interface:
```
/ip packing add interface=ether1 aggregated-size=1500 packing=simple unpacking=none
```
On Router-B:
Make sure discovery is enabled:
```
/ip neighbor discovery set ether3 discover=yes
```
Add packing rule for the interface:
```
/ip packing add interface=ether3 aggregated-size=1500 packing=none unpacking=simple
```
