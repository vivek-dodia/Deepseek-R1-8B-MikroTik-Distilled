I have two sites connected by two Mikrotiks through an IP tunnel over IPsec.In Site1, I have several LANs that can successfully communicate with LAN1 in Site2.Now I need the LANs in Site1 to connect to the remote IPsec sites of Site2 (Azure, GCP, Branch1, Branch2).How can I achieve this?Could I use some kind of NAT?the red line indicates the remote network I want to reach.I am attaching an image with the network design.

on site 1 router you nead add ipsec policy witch dst net of azure and the reverse to site 2nat it is not necessary if you set correct routing in azure

Thank you very much for your response.That is the logical solution, but I cannot implement it because I don't control Azure, GCP, or the other offices, so I have to use the output already established by Site2.Could I use a NAT at Site2 so that when something destined for Azure comes in, it changes the address to the LAN used to connect to Azure?

ensures 1<-->2 site connection via ipsec witch azure networks policies, and then use NAT on router site2 like:EXAMPLE-1/ip routeadd dst-address=10.10.10.0/24 (network azure) gateway=1.1.1.1 (ISP GW) pref-src=192.168.1.1 (LAN mikrotik ip/site2) routing-table=main/ip firewall natadd action=masquerade chain=srcnat dst-address=10.10.10.0/24 (network azure) out-interface=e1_WAN (ISP GW lnk) src-address=192.168.2.0/24 (LAN net site1)EXAMPLE-2 / do +/- the same/ip firewall natadd action=src-nat chain=srcnat dst-address=10.10.10.0/24 (network azure)  out-interface=e1_WAN (ISP GW lnk) src-address=192.168.2.0/24 (LAN net site1) to-addresses=192.168.1.1 (LAN mikrotik ip/site2)
