Okay, let's craft some detailed documentation focusing on PPP AAA for a MikroTik point-to-point link scenario, specifically targeting RouterOS 7.12 with a basic configuration using the provided subnet and interface name.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up a point-to-point link using a PPP server on one MikroTik router (the server) and a PPP client on another MikroTik router. The PPP server will handle authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) using the local user database. The client, upon connection, will be assigned an IP address from the `252.58.74.0/24` subnet. The PPP interface name on the server will be `wlan-98`.

## Implementation Steps:

**Note:** This configuration assumes basic network connectivity exists between the two MikroTik devices. We will configure the *server* side for AAA. We will be using the built in MikroTik User Database.

**Step 1: Configure the PPP Interface on the Server**

* **Purpose:** This step creates the PPP server interface where clients will connect. We are using a specific interface for listening, in this case, `wlan-98`. If not using wireless, this could also be a virtual interface such as an ethernet or vlan interface.
* **Before:** No PPP server interface is configured on `wlan-98`.
* **Command (CLI):**
   ```mikrotik
   /interface ppp-server add name=ppp-server-1 interface=wlan-98 service=pptp max-mru=1480 max-mtu=1480 disabled=no
   ```
   * `add name=ppp-server-1`: Creates a new PPP server with the name "ppp-server-1" (You can rename this as needed)
   * `interface=wlan-98`: Specifies the interface the PPP server listens on.
   * `service=pptp`: Sets the type of PPP service. We are using `pptp` for example, you can use `pppoe` or another valid service type.
   * `max-mru=1480 max-mtu=1480`: Sets the Maximum Receive/Transmit Unit and Maximum Transmit Unit sizes. This is common for PPP.
   * `disabled=no`: Enables the PPP server.
* **After:** A PPP server interface named `ppp-server-1` is active on `wlan-98`, ready to accept incoming `pptp` connections.
* **Winbox GUI:** In Winbox, navigate to `PPP` -> `PPP Server` tab. Click the `+` button. Under the `General` tab set the `Name` to `ppp-server-1`. Under the `Interface` dropdown select `wlan-98`. Under the `Service` dropdown select `pptp`, Set the `Max MRU` and `Max MTU` to `1480`. Check the `Enabled` checkbox. Click `Apply` to save.
* **Explanation:** This step creates a server interface that will handle incoming ppp connections.

**Step 2: Create a PPP Profile**

* **Purpose:** This step creates a profile to define the IP address range and DNS settings that will be assigned to connecting clients.
* **Before:** No PPP profile is configured.
* **Command (CLI):**
   ```mikrotik
   /ppp profile add name=ppp-profile-1 local-address=252.58.74.1 remote-address=252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 use-encryption=yes only-one=yes
   ```
    * `add name=ppp-profile-1`: Creates a new profile named "ppp-profile-1".
    * `local-address=252.58.74.1`: The IP address of the server on the PPP link.
    * `remote-address=252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254`: The range of addresses that can be assigned to PPP clients.
    * `dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: The DNS servers that will be passed to the client upon connection.
    * `use-encryption=yes`: Enforces encryption over the PPP link.
    * `only-one=yes`: Restricts a user to one active connection at a time.
* **After:** A profile named `ppp-profile-1` is created, ready to be used by PPP user accounts.
* **Winbox GUI:** In Winbox, navigate to `PPP` -> `Profiles` tab. Click the `+` button. Under the `General` tab, set the `Name` to `ppp-profile-1`. Under the `Addresses` tab, set `Local Address` to `252.58.74.1` and `Remote Address` to `252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254`. Under the `DNS` tab, add `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` to the `DNS Servers`. Under the `Encryption` Tab Check the `Use Encryption` checkbox. Click `Apply` to save.
* **Explanation:** This step sets up the IP address and DNS parameters that will be used by ppp clients.

**Step 3: Create a PPP User**

* **Purpose:** This step creates a user account that can authenticate to the PPP server.
* **Before:** No PPP users are configured.
* **Command (CLI):**
   ```mikrotik
   /ppp secret add name=user1 password=password1 service=pptp profile=ppp-profile-1
   ```
    * `add name=user1`: Creates a new user named `user1`.
    * `password=password1`: Sets the password for the user to `password1`. (Always use stronger passwords in production.)
    * `service=pptp`: Specifies the service to which this user is allowed.
    * `profile=ppp-profile-1`: Specifies the profile to assign to this user.
* **After:** A PPP user named `user1` with password `password1` is created, and it will use the settings from `ppp-profile-1` when connecting.
* **Winbox GUI:** In Winbox, navigate to `PPP` -> `Secrets` tab. Click the `+` button. Set the `Name` to `user1`. Set the `Password` to `password1`. Set the `Service` dropdown to `pptp`. Under the `Profile` dropdown select `ppp-profile-1`. Click `Apply` to save.
* **Explanation:** This creates the user accounts that the client devices will use when connecting.

**Step 4: Configure the PPP Client (On the Client Router)**

* **Purpose:** This step configures the client side of the PPP connection to dial into the server.
* **Before:** No PPP client is configured.
* **Command (CLI - On the Client Router):**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ppp-client add name=ppp-client-1 connect-to=SERVER_IP user=user1 password=password1 service=pptp use-encryption=yes profile=default
    ```
    *   `add name=ppp-client-1`: Creates a new PPP client interface named `ppp-client-1`.
    *   `connect-to=SERVER_IP`: Replace `SERVER_IP` with the actual IP address of the server's `wlan-98` interface.
    *   `user=user1`: The username for authentication.
    *   `password=password1`: The password for authentication.
    *   `service=pptp`: The type of PPP service to use.
    *   `use-encryption=yes`: Enforces encryption.
    *   `profile=default`: The default ppp profile should be used, as this is a client.
* **After:** A PPP client interface named `ppp-client-1` attempts to connect to the server.
* **Winbox GUI:** In Winbox, on the *client router*, navigate to `Interfaces`. Click the `+` button and select `PPTP Client`. Under the `General` tab, set the `Name` to `ppp-client-1`. Under the `Connect To` field set the servers IP address. Set the user to `user1` and the password to `password1`. Under the `Dial Out` tab select `pptp` for the `Service`. Under the `General` Tab, check the `Use Encryption` checkbox. Click `Apply` to save.
* **Explanation:** This configures the client to dial out to the server via ppp.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

**Server Router Configuration:**

```mikrotik
/interface ppp-server
add name=ppp-server-1 interface=wlan-98 service=pptp max-mru=1480 max-mtu=1480 disabled=no
/ppp profile
add name=ppp-profile-1 local-address=252.58.74.1 remote-address=252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 use-encryption=yes only-one=yes
/ppp secret
add name=user1 password=password1 service=pptp profile=ppp-profile-1
```

**Client Router Configuration:**

```mikrotik
/interface ppp-client
add name=ppp-client-1 connect-to=SERVER_IP user=user1 password=password1 service=pptp use-encryption=yes profile=default
```

*Replace `SERVER_IP` with the actual IP of the server's `wlan-98` interface.*

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Authentication Failures:** Double-check usernames and passwords on both the server and the client. Ensure the correct PPP service type (`pptp` in this case) is used. Check the server logs (`/system logging`) for detailed error messages related to authentication failures.
*   **MTU/MRU Mismatches:** Ensure that the MTU and MRU values are consistent across all devices involved. Incorrect values can lead to connection drops or slow traffic. Generally `1480` is a safe default for PPP.
*   **IP Address Conflicts:** Make sure the IP address ranges defined in the PPP profiles do not conflict with other networks.
*   **Encryption Issues:** If encryption is enabled, make sure it's supported and configured correctly on both ends. If having trouble, try disabling it to troubleshoot issues with the base PPP connectivity first.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Make sure that the MikroTik firewalls allow for ppp traffic. Specifically the `pptp` protocol.
    * Solution: Add rules on the servers input chain to accept `pptp` traffic and in the forwards chain to allow traffic for the local address to the network.
*   **Router Resources:** For large numbers of clients, the router might experience high CPU usage. Monitor CPU and memory usage. Consider upgrading hardware if necessary. Consider using `pppoe` in a more robust and scalable scenario.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **On the Server Router:**
    *   Monitor the PPP server interface status `/interface ppp-server print`. Check that the interface is enabled.
    *   Check active PPP connections using `/ppp active print`.
    *   Monitor logs using `/log print follow-only topic=ppp`.
2.  **On the Client Router:**
    *   Check that the PPP client interface has connected successfully by issuing `/interface ppp-client print` and checking the status is connected.
    *   Use `/ping 252.58.74.1` to test the connection to the server's IP address.
    *   Use `/ip route print` to verify that a route to `252.58.74.0/24` is configured.
    *   Check connection logs using `/log print follow-only topic=ppp`.
3.  **Advanced Testing:**
    *   Use MikroTik's `torch` tool `/tool torch interface=ppp-client-1` to analyze traffic and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
    *   Use `/tool profile` to diagnose if the client is using excessive CPU.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Radius:** For larger deployments, consider using RADIUS servers for AAA (instead of the local MikroTik user database).
*   **IP Pools:** Use IP pools in conjunction with profiles for more complex IP address assignment.
*   **VPN:** Consider using IPsec for more secure connectivity when creating the point to point link.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Create proper firewall rules to limit access to the ppp interface and the network it connects to.
*   **Queues/Traffic Shaping:** Implement queues to manage bandwidth usage per user.
*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** Isolate the ppp link in its own VRF to separate the traffic in a larger network.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

The following provides examples to configure the same setup via MikroTik's REST API. **Note:** These examples assume you have set up API access on your MikroTik router.

**Step 1: Create PPP Server Interface (using API):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/interface/ppp-server`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Payload (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "ppp-server-1",
      "interface": "wlan-98",
      "service": "pptp",
      "max-mru": 1480,
      "max-mtu": 1480,
      "disabled": false
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success - 200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "ppp-server was created successfully",
        "id": "*4",
        "disabled": "false",
        "interface": "wlan-98",
        "max-mru": 1480,
        "max-mtu": 1480,
        "name": "ppp-server-1",
        "service": "pptp"
    }
    ```
*   **Error Handling (Example):** If the interface `wlan-98` is missing, it will return an error:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "input does not match any value of interface",
        "error": true,
        "code": 400
    }
    ```

**Step 2: Create PPP Profile (using API):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/ppp/profile`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Payload (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
       "name": "ppp-profile-1",
       "local-address": "252.58.74.1",
       "remote-address": "252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254",
       "dns-server": "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4",
       "use-encryption": true,
       "only-one": true
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success - 200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "ppp-profile was created successfully",
        "id": "*4",
        "local-address": "252.58.74.1",
        "name": "ppp-profile-1",
         "only-one": "true",
        "remote-address": "252.58.74.2-252.58.74.254",
        "use-encryption": "true"
    }
    ```

**Step 3: Create PPP Secret (using API):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/ppp/secret`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Payload (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "user1",
        "password": "password1",
        "service": "pptp",
        "profile": "ppp-profile-1"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success - 200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "ppp-secret was created successfully",
        "id": "*4",
        "name": "user1",
        "password": "password1",
        "profile": "ppp-profile-1",
        "service": "pptp"
    }
    ```

**Error Handling:** Ensure error responses are handled and properly addressed. The REST API will return various HTTP status codes and JSON objects with details about any error that occurred.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex, randomly generated passwords for PPP users.
*   **Encryption:** Always enable encryption (`use-encryption=yes`) for PPP connections.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to limit access to the PPP server.
*   **Limited Services:** Disable services that aren't needed. Do not expose the `api` or `winbox` services over the internet.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Regularly update RouterOS to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review your configurations and logs for unusual activity.
*   **Radius:** Implement `radius` as an auth source, this will allow logging of connection events and also be a good practice to scale to more clients in the future.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Password Strength:** The example uses weak passwords. In production, use strong, randomly generated passwords.
*   **Scalability:** The configuration is basic and doesn't scale well. It uses the local database instead of Radius. A radius server would make more sense to scale up to many users.
*   **Security:** Firewall rules are not explicitly added, which can result in a security vulnerability. Adding some specific firewall rules and the end of the configuration would be useful.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement better monitoring and logging. Use an external service such as `Zabbix` or `Grafana` to monitor the link.
*   **More Security:** Could have mentioned `L2TP` or `IPSec` instead of `PPTP`. `PPTP` is not secure, and other options are better in modern deployments.
*   **User Management:** Could have mentioned more detailed User Management aspects. Groups and limitations.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic:

**PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):**

PPP AAA is a framework for controlling access to network resources via a point to point link. It consists of the following components:

*   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a connecting user or device. This can involve checking usernames, passwords or certificates. In our example, this is done with a username and password from a local user database.
*   **Authorization:** Determining what a user is allowed to do after authentication. This could include which IP address range or what type of services can be used. In our example, this is controlled by the PPP Profile and user permissions.
*   **Accounting:** Tracking resource usage, such as connection time, bandwidth and data usage. This can be used for billing, monitoring, or security purposes. In our example, usage is logged in the router logs but can be configured to be sent to a radius server for more detailed accounting.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

**Local vs. RADIUS AAA:**

*   **Local User Database:**
    *   **Pros:** Simple to configure, suitable for small deployments. No external dependencies.
    *   **Cons:** Not scalable, difficult to manage large numbers of users, limited reporting and auditing features.
*   **RADIUS AAA:**
    *   **Pros:** Scalable, centralized user management, robust reporting and auditing, supports more complex policies. Can be tied to LDAP or other Directory Services.
    *   **Cons:** More complex setup, requires an external server, increased overhead for smaller setups.

**Encryption Choices:**

*   **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):**
    *   **Pros:** Easy to configure, widely supported.
    *   **Cons:**  Considered insecure, vulnerable to attacks, should be avoided in production.
*   **L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over IPsec):**
    *   **Pros:** More secure, widely supported, better performance.
    *   **Cons:** More complex configuration.
*   **IPsec:**
    *   **Pros:** Highest levels of security.
    *   **Cons:** Can be harder to configure and sometimes less performant than other solutions.

**Interface:**

*   **Wireless:**
    *   **Pros:** No wired infrastructure is required, cheaper and faster to setup.
    *   **Cons:** Can be susceptible to interference, may be less stable.
*   **Wired:**
    *   **Pros:** More reliable, often faster.
    *   **Cons:** Can be more expensive, requires physical wiring.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The commands used in this document are compatible with RouterOS 7.12 as well as 6.48 and most RouterOS versions starting with 7.x. Minor syntactical changes may be needed for older versions. Consult the MikroTik documentation for specific versions to ensure compatibility. For the most part, the settings and values should be generally similar and compatible.
