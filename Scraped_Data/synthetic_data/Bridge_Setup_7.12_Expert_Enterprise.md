**Bridge Setup on MikroTik RouterOS**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

This guide covers the setup of a bridge on a MikroTik RouterOS device to connect multiple Ethernet ports into a single logical network segment. This is useful for creating VLANs, bonding multiple physical interfaces, or connecting devices that require a bridge connection.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Create the Bridge Interface:**
   - Navigate to **Interfaces > Bridge**.
   - Click the **+** button.
   - Enter a name for the bridge, e.g., "VLAN10".

2. **Add Physical Interfaces to the Bridge:**
   - Select the Interfaces tab in the bridge configuration.
   - Click the **+** button and select the physical interfaces you want to bridge, e.g., "ether1" and "ether2".

3. **Configure the Bridge Settings:**
   - In the Bridge Properties tab, configure the following optional settings:
     - **Protocol:** The bridging protocol to use, such as "802.1d" for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
     - **Learning:** Whether the bridge should learn MAC addresses and create a forwarding table.
     - **Forwarding:** Whether the bridge should forward traffic based on the MAC address table.

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/interface bridge add name=VLAN10
/interface bridge port add bridge=VLAN10 interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=VLAN10 interface=ether2
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

- **Loop:** Ensure that there are no loops in the bridge topology to prevent broadcast storms.
- **VLAN Tagging:** If VLAN tagging is required, configure the appropriate VLAN ID on the bridge port.
- **Security:** Disable unused bridge ports to prevent unauthorized access.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

To verify the bridge setup, ping between devices connected to the bridged ports:

```
ping 192.168.1.2
```

**Related Features and Considerations**

- **VLAN Support:** RouterOS supports VLAN tagging, which allows multiple VLANs to be carried over a single bridge.
- **Bridging with Wireless Interfaces:** Bridges can also be created between wireless and wired interfaces (known as "Wi-Fi bridging").
- **Advanced Features:** RouterOS offers advanced bridging features such as STP, RSTP, and VLAN trunking.
