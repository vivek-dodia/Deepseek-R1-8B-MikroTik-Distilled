# MikroTik IP Routing Configuration for Subnet 169.162.215.0/24 on bridge-94

This document outlines a configuration for routing traffic within the 169.162.215.0/24 subnet using a MikroTik router (RouterOS v7.11). The interface `bridge-94` will be the primary interface for this subnet.

## 1. Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**

We're establishing a basic local network on the subnet `169.162.215.0/24`. All devices within this network will be connected to a single bridge interface on the MikroTik router. This is a common starting point for small to medium-sized networks and represents a flat, single-segment network topology.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS version 7.11 (or higher).
*   A configured MikroTik router with network connectivity.
*   Basic understanding of MikroTik RouterOS.
*   Access to the router via Winbox, SSH, or the Webfig interface.

**Configuration Level:** Basic
**Network Scale:** Enterprise

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

We will walk through configuring the `bridge-94` interface and applying an IP address to it via the MikroTik command line interface (CLI). This configuration is also easily reproducible via Winbox.

**Using CLI:**

1.  **Create the bridge interface:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge
    add name=bridge-94
    ```
    *   `add name=bridge-94` - Creates a new bridge interface named `bridge-94`.
2.  **Assign an IP address to the bridge:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=169.162.215.1/24 interface=bridge-94
    ```
    *   `add address=169.162.215.1/24` - Assigns IP address `169.162.215.1` with a subnet mask of `/24`.
    *   `interface=bridge-94` -  Assigns the IP address to the `bridge-94` interface.
3.  **Enable forwarding on the bridge interface (required for bridging):**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface bridge set bridge-94 forwarding=yes
        ```
    *   `forwarding=yes` - Enables forwarding on the bridge, allowing layer-2 and layer-3 functionality.
4.  **Add the desired interfaces to the bridge (example - ether2 and ether3):**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether2
    add bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether3
    ```
    *   `bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether2` - Add interface `ether2` to the bridge `bridge-94`.
    *   `bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether3` - Add interface `ether3` to the bridge `bridge-94`.

**Using Winbox GUI:**

1.  **Create Bridge:** Go to `Bridge` under Interfaces -> `+` button -> Name: `bridge-94`, Click `Apply` and `OK`
2.  **Add IP Address:** Go to `IP` -> `Addresses` -> `+` button -> Address: `169.162.215.1/24`, Interface: `bridge-94`, Click `Apply` and `OK`.
3.  **Add Ports to Bridge:** Go to `Bridge` -> `Ports` tab -> `+` button -> Interface: `ether2`, Bridge: `bridge-94`. Click `Apply` and `OK`. Repeat the procedure to add `ether3`.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-94

/ip address
add address=169.162.215.1/24 interface=bridge-94

/interface bridge set bridge-94 forwarding=yes

/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether3
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** Ensure the subnet mask (`/24` in this case) matches your network requirements.
*   **Interface Misconfiguration:** Make sure the interfaces intended for the bridge are added correctly.
*   **Firewall Rules:** The router's firewall can block traffic within the bridge or to other networks.
*  **Forwarding Not Enabled:** Failure to enable forwarding will prevent devices from talking to each other on the same bridge.

**Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Check IP Address:** Use `/ip address print` to verify IP address assignment to `bridge-94`.
2.  **Check Bridge Status:** Use `/interface bridge print detail` to view bridge and port statuses.
3.  **Ping Test:** Use `/ping 169.162.215.1` from within the router and from a device connected to the bridge.
4. **Check Forwarding:** Ensure that `/interface bridge print detail` shows that the `forwarding` setting is enabled.
5.  **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=bridge-94` to monitor traffic on the bridge interface.

**Error Example:**

*   **Scenario:** You forgot to enable forwarding
*   **Error Message:** Devices on the bridge cannot communicate with each other
*   **Troubleshooting:**  `/interface bridge print detail` will show that `forwarding` is set to `no`, and traffic will not flow.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Ping Test:**
    *   Connect a device to one of the bridge ports (e.g., `ether2`).
    *   Assign a static IP address on the 169.162.215.0/24 subnet (e.g., `169.162.215.2/24`).
    *   Ping the bridge IP (`169.162.215.1`).
    *   Ping between devices connected to different bridge ports.
2.  **Traceroute:**
    *   Use `traceroute` to trace the path of traffic within the subnet.
3.  **Torch:**
    *   Start `/tool torch interface=bridge-94` and generate some traffic to check network flow.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

**Bridge Interface:**

*   **Layer 2 Functionality:** Bridges operate at Layer 2 (data link layer) of the OSI model, forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses.
*   **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):** You can enable STP to prevent loops in redundant bridge topologies (not needed for this basic example but important for more complex designs).

**IP Addressing:**

*   **Multiple IP Addresses:** You can add multiple IP addresses to the bridge for various purposes (secondary subnets).
*   **IPv6 Support:** RouterOS supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on interfaces.

**Less Common Features (Example - MACVLAN):**

*   **MACVLAN:** allows multiple virtual interfaces using the same hardware interface (useful for isolating traffic), but they would be on the same Layer 2 segment if bridged.

    ```mikrotik
    /interface macvlan
    add interface=ether2 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01 name=macvlan1
    add interface=ether2 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:02 name=macvlan2

    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=bridge-94 interface=macvlan1
    add bridge=bridge-94 interface=macvlan2

    /ip address
    add address=169.162.215.10/24 interface=macvlan1
    add address=169.162.215.11/24 interface=macvlan2

    /interface bridge set bridge-94 forwarding=yes
    ```

**Limitations:**

*   **Broadcast Domain:** All devices on a bridge are part of the same broadcast domain, which can lead to increased broadcast traffic in large networks.
*   **Hardware Offloading (Limitations):** Not all hardware bridges can be offloaded to the switch chip, affecting performance in some scenarios.

## 8. In-Depth Explanation of Core Concepts

**Bridging:**

*   **Layer 2 Function:** A bridge operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model. It forwards frames based on their MAC addresses. This means it essentially creates a large shared layer-2 network. In our case, the `bridge-94` makes it so all devices plugged into `ether2` or `ether3` see each other as if they are plugged into a single switch.
*   **No Routing:** Bridging doesn't involve any IP layer decisions. Traffic between devices on the same bridge happens at Layer 2. Routing is needed to communicate with other networks.
*   **Spanning Tree:** For redundancy, bridges can use STP to prevent loops.

**IP Addressing:**

*   **Logical Layer:** IP addresses are part of the logical network layer (Layer 3).
*   **Subnetting:** Using the `/24` subnet mask allows a maximum of 254 usable IP addresses (`169.162.215.1 - 169.162.215.254`).
*   **Network and Broadcast Address:** `169.162.215.0` is the network address, and `169.162.215.255` is the broadcast address. These addresses are not assigned to individual devices.

**Why These Commands?**

*   `/interface bridge add name=bridge-94`: This command creates a bridge interface, which bundles multiple interfaces into one layer-2 domain.
*   `/ip address add address=169.162.215.1/24 interface=bridge-94`: This command assigns an IP address to the *bridge interface* itself. This makes the router reachable on that subnet and is the gateway address for hosts connected to the bridge.
*   `/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-94 interface=ether2`: Adds `ether2` to the `bridge-94` interface. This means all traffic received at `ether2` will be bridged to other interfaces in the same bridge.

## 9. Security Best Practices

**Specific to MikroTik Routers:**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set a strong administrator password.
*   **Disable Default User:** Disable or change the default `admin` user.
*   **Limit Access:** Restrict Winbox, SSH, and other services to specific IP addresses.
*   **Firewall:** Implement a firewall to protect the router itself and the network.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=22 in-interface=!list=LAN action=drop comment="Drop SSH from WAN"
    add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=8291 in-interface=!list=LAN action=drop comment="Drop Winbox from WAN"

    /ip firewall address-list
    add address=169.162.215.0/24 list=LAN
    ```
*   **Upgrade RouterOS:** Keep the RouterOS firmware updated to the latest version.
*   **Use Certificates:** Use certificates for secure connections to RouterOS for WinBox access
