At least for now.Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident as the MT cloud appears to lack sufficient redundancy. Whenever possible, we are phasing out the built-in function in favour of Cloudflare DDNS which is highly redundant and locally available through out the world.

I also have never used the Mikrotik DDNS service.  Using Dynu.com and have never had a failure in a good five years.

Reliable!, safe! an excellent options package for all routers.

noticed I dropped a few ddns routers, is it down? I have been pushing the router alone for the ddns service and will need to stop if the service is getting terminated.
