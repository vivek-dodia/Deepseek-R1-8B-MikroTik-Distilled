I have a problem with CRS112-8P-4S / 7.16.2 (stable) after installing the 7.17 update.Since then, the CPU has been much more heavily utilised and accordingly there is a lot of hiccups when transferring data. I have tested it with a connected AccessPoint, a bridge with VLAN is configured. The SSID is in an extra subnet/VLAN.Under 7.16.2 and previous versions there are no restrictions. With 7.17, for example, a YouTube video loads very slowly and is unusable.I have reinstalled 7.16.2 and the problems are gone.How can I provide support so that the problem can be found?Sorry for my english.

You havevlan-filtering=yeson bridge and CRS1xx can't offload such bridge to underlying switch chip. So all traffic passes CPU. This was the case since forever, nothing changed with 7.17 ... so you can consider yourself lucky that it didn't bite you earlier.You have to configure VLAN stuff on switch chip directly. UseCRS1xx switch manual, some examples are inexamples page.

looks like its a common issue..something with switch chip and vlans need to be applied... we have bought a unit for testing even knowing its jut 1 cpu core 400mhz..our small traffic around 200mbps and its already 100% cpu.  on tools profiles it shows..  networking 25 to 30% max.. but the most cpu usage is on management nearly 40% link for attached picture belowmanagement.pngAnyone has idea on what it could be?only 3 firewall nat rules..2 vlanbridge on 4 ports..
