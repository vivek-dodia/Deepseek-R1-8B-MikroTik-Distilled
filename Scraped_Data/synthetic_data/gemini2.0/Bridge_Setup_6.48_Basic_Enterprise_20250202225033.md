**RouterOS Bridge Setup**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

* Bridge two or more network segments together to extend the network and communicate between them.
* Create a virtual interface that combines physical interfaces into a single logical segment.
* Support VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to isolate traffic based on different virtual networks.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**1. Create a New Bridge**

* Go to **Interfaces** > **Bridge** and click on the **+** button.
* Enter a **Name** for the bridge.

**2. Add Physical Interfaces to the Bridge**

* Select the **Ports** tab and add the physical interfaces you want to bridge together.
* Click on the **Add** button and select the desired interfaces.

**3. Configure VLANs (Optional)**

* Go to **Interfaces** > **VLAN** and click on the **+** button.
* Enter a **Name** for the VLAN.
* Set the **Bridge** to the bridge you created earlier.
* Assign the VLAN ID and other necessary parameters.

**4. Configure Firewall Rules (Optional)**

* Go to **IP** > **Firewall** > **Filter Rules** and create firewall rules to control traffic between the bridged interfaces.

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```bash
/interface bridge add name=my-bridge
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether2
/interface vlan add name=my-vlan1 bridge=my-bridge vlan-id=10
/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input in-interface=my-bridge
/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=output out-interface=my-bridge
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

* Ensure that the physical interfaces are compatible with bridging.
* Verify that the interfaces have valid IP addresses configured before adding them to the bridge.
* If bridging is not working, check the firewall rules and ensure they allow traffic between the bridged interfaces.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

* Ping between devices connected to the bridged interfaces.
* Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic on the bridge.
* Monitor the bridge interface status in the RouterOS web interface.

**Related Features and Considerations**

* Use the **Spanning Tree Protocol** to prevent loops and ensure network stability.
* Consider using **VLANs** to isolate different network segments and improve security.
* Utilize the **Bridge Firewall** to control traffic between the bridged interfaces.
