Okay, let's dive into a detailed, expert-level documentation for setting up certificates on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.12 device, specifically in the context of a Point-to-Point link utilizing the 131.81.104.0/24 subnet on interface `wlan-76`.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario involves setting up secure communication using TLS certificates on a MikroTik router. While this example will demonstrate self-signed certificates, the same process applies to certificates signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). The primary goal here is to understand the process of generating, importing, and using certificates within RouterOS, which can be foundational for secure VPNs, secure API access, HTTPS management interfaces, and other encrypted communications. This specific configuration will focus on having the certificate available for use in various services.

## Implementation Steps:

Here’s a step-by-step guide to configuring certificates using the MikroTik CLI:

1.  **Step 1: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**

    *   **Explanation:** Before we can use a certificate, we need to generate one. We’ll create a self-signed certificate which, while not ideal for public-facing services, is excellent for internal or point-to-point scenarios to learn the process.
    *   **CLI Command (before):** N/A
    *   **CLI Command (after):**

        ```mikrotik
        /certificate
        add name=my-self-signed-cert common-name="131.81.104.1" key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client days-valid=365
        ```
    *   **Effect:** This command creates a new certificate named `my-self-signed-cert` with a common name of `131.81.104.1`.  `key-usage` defines the permissible uses for the certificate. `days-valid` sets the expiration date.

    *   **Winbox GUI equivalent:**
        1.  Navigate to `System > Certificates`
        2.  Click the `+` button to add a new certificate
        3.  Under the `General` tab, input:
            *   Name: `my-self-signed-cert`
            *   Common Name: `131.81.104.1`
        4.  Under the `Key Usage` tab, tick:
            *   `digital-signature`
            *   `key-encipherment`
            *   `tls-server`
            *   `tls-client`
        5.  Under the `Options` tab, input:
            *   Days Valid: `365`
        6.  Click `Apply`

2.  **Step 2: Verify Certificate Creation**

    *   **Explanation:** After creating the certificate, it's good practice to check that the certificate has been generated successfully.
    *   **CLI Command (before):** N/A
    *   **CLI Command (after):**

        ```mikrotik
        /certificate print
        ```
    *   **Effect:** This command displays a list of all certificates, including the newly created one. We look for a line with `name="my-self-signed-cert"` showing that the new certificate is available in the certificate store.

        ```mikrotik
        Flags: K - private-key, C - ca, A - authority, T - trusted
         #   NAME             SUBJECT                 FINGERPRINT                                     
         0 K   my-self-signed-cert cn=131.81.104.1      7b49a3...
        ```

    *   **Winbox GUI equivalent:**
        1.  Navigate to `System > Certificates`
        2.  Verify that the `my-self-signed-cert` is displayed in the list and it's status is valid.

3.  **Step 3:  Export the Certificate (Optional)**

    *   **Explanation:** If you need to use the certificate in other systems, or another device, you will need to export the certificate and the corresponding key. We'll export the certificate in PEM format so that it can be used in other systems.
    *   **CLI Command (before):** N/A
    *   **CLI Command (after):**

       ```mikrotik
        /certificate export-certificate my-self-signed-cert export-private-key=yes passphrase="securepassword" file-name=my-cert.pem
        ```
    *   **Effect:** This command exports the certificate and the corresponding private key to a file named `my-cert.pem`, also encrypting it with the `securepassword` passphrase.

    *   **Winbox GUI equivalent:**
        1.  Navigate to `System > Certificates`
        2.  Select the certificate `my-self-signed-cert`.
        3.  Click `Export Key`.
        4.  Input a file name under "File Name", like `my-cert.pem`
        5.  Tick the `Export Private Key` box.
        6.  Input and remember a passphrase for your private key under "Passphrase".
        7.  Click the "Export" button, and save the file to your computer.

    *   **Note:** This step is optional, and is provided to demonstrate how to export certificates. The next step uses the newly-created cert in the router, not a exported version.

4.  **Step 4: Apply the Certificate to a Service**

    *   **Explanation:**  Now that we have a certificate, we can assign it to a service. As an example, we’ll assign it to the WebFig (web-based management interface). This will change the web interface to use HTTPS with your certificate.
    *   **CLI Command (before):**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip service print
        ```
        **Example Output:**

        ```mikrotik
         Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
         #   NAME     PORT ADDRESS            CERTIFICATE        
         0   api       8728  0.0.0.0/0                                
         1   api-ssl   8729  0.0.0.0/0                                
         2   www       80    0.0.0.0/0                                
         3   www-ssl  443    0.0.0.0/0                                
        ```
    *   **CLI Command (after):**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip service set www-ssl certificate=my-self-signed-cert
        ```
    *   **Effect:** This command modifies the `www-ssl` service to use the `my-self-signed-cert` certificate.

    *   **Winbox GUI equivalent:**
        1.  Navigate to `IP > Services`
        2.  Double click the `www-ssl` service.
        3.  Select `my-self-signed-cert` from the dropdown under the `Certificate` option.
        4.  Click `Apply`
        5.  Click `Ok`.
5. **Step 5 Verify that the service is using the certificate**

   *  **Explanation:** Double check that the service has been correctly configured to use the created certificate.
    *   **CLI Command (before):**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip service print
        ```
        **Example Output:**
        ```mikrotik
         Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
         #   NAME     PORT ADDRESS            CERTIFICATE        
         0   api       8728  0.0.0.0/0                                
         1   api-ssl   8729  0.0.0.0/0                                
         2   www       80    0.0.0.0/0                                
         3   www-ssl  443    0.0.0.0/0                                
        ```
     *   **CLI Command (after):**
      ```mikrotik
        /ip service print
        ```
        **Example Output:**
        ```mikrotik
         Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
         #   NAME     PORT ADDRESS            CERTIFICATE        
         0   api       8728  0.0.0.0/0                                
         1   api-ssl   8729  0.0.0.0/0                                
         2   www       80    0.0.0.0/0                                
         3   www-ssl  443    0.0.0.0/0       my-self-signed-cert
        ```

    * **Winbox GUI equivalent**
        1. Navigate to `IP > Services`
        2. Verify that the `www-ssl` service has `my-self-signed-cert` listed under `Certificate`.

6. **Step 6: Access Router via HTTPS**

    * **Explanation** Now that the web service is configured for HTTPS and the `www-ssl` service is using your certificate, attempt to connect to the router using a web browser via HTTPS (e.g., https://131.81.104.1).
    * **Winbox GUI equivalent:** Open your browser and input the router IP using HTTPS (e.g., https://131.81.104.1).
    * **Effect** The browser will warn you that the certificate is not trusted, as it's a self-signed certificate, but you can add an exception and proceed. This will verify that the web service is configured to use the new certificate, and that it is working.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/certificate
add name=my-self-signed-cert common-name="131.81.104.1" key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client days-valid=365
/ip service set www-ssl certificate=my-self-signed-cert
```

*   **`/certificate add`**
    *   `name`: The name of the certificate.
    *   `common-name`: The common name, typically a domain name or IP address.
    *   `key-usage`: List of permitted key usages for the certificate, can be multiple.
        *   `digital-signature`: The certificate can be used for digital signatures.
        *   `key-encipherment`: The certificate can be used for key encryption.
        *   `tls-server`: The certificate can be used as a TLS server certificate.
        *   `tls-client`: The certificate can be used as a TLS client certificate.
    *    `days-valid`: The number of days the certificate is valid for.
*  **`/ip service set`**
    * `www-ssl`: The name of the service to be configured. In this case, the `www-ssl` service provides secure https access to the router.
    * `certificate`: The name of the certificate to assign to the service.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Browser Certificate Warnings:** Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers by default, causing warnings. You must add an exception in your browser to proceed. This isn't a security issue in a controlled, point-to-point environment but should be avoided with public facing resources.
*   **Incorrect `key-usage`**: If you miss key usages, the certificate might not work as intended in certain services. For example, if `tls-server` is missing, it won't work for HTTPS services.
*   **Expired Certificates:** Certificates expire. Use the `/certificate print` command to check expiration dates and renew certificates well in advance. If the certificate has expired it will not work.
*   **Private Key Lost:** If you lose the private key associated with the certificate, you need to regenerate the certificate and associated key. Ensure proper storage and backup procedures for keys and certificates.
* **Certificate not showing up:** If you create a new certificate in the RouterOS, and it does not show up in the dropdown in Winbox, be sure the "subject" field is populated, or the certificate may not be properly registered for use by other functions in the RouterOS. A properly created certificate will be marked with "K" (Private Key).

## Verification and Testing Steps:

*   **Check Certificate List:**
    *   Use `/certificate print` to verify that the certificate exists and is valid.
*   **Check Assigned Services:**
    *   Use `/ip service print` to confirm that the service (e.g., `www-ssl`) is correctly referencing the created certificate.
*   **Web Access (HTTPS):**
    *   Open a web browser and navigate to the router’s IP address using `https://`. Accept the security warning and ensure the connection is working over HTTPS.
* **Use `openssl` to check the cert**
    * Export the certificate from the router using the export command above, and save the pem file to your computer.
    * Using your computer terminal, and `openssl` command, check the certificate to ensure it's working as expected:
    ```
    openssl x509 -in my-cert.pem -text -noout
    ```
    * This should output the full text information of your certificate, including the subject, and issuer, the validity dates, and the public key data.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates:** For public-facing services or more complex scenarios, use CA-signed certificates.  These require importing the CA certificate and the certificate.  Use the `/certificate import` command.
*   **ACME/Let's Encrypt:** MikroTik supports automated certificate management through ACME, allowing you to obtain free SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt (requires external interface and DNS).
*   **VPN Certificates:** Certificates can be used for VPN services such as IPSec and OpenVPN. The process is similar but specific parameters are needed.
*   **API Security:** Certificates are fundamental to securing API access to the router, particularly for REST API.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Here’s an example using the MikroTik REST API to add a certificate (note that API must be enabled).

**1. Create Self-Signed Certificate**

   * **Endpoint:** `/certificate`
   * **Method:** `POST`
   * **JSON Payload:**

     ```json
     {
        "name": "api-cert",
         "common-name": "131.81.104.1",
         "key-usage": "digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client",
        "days-valid": 365
    }
     ```
   * **Expected Successful Response (201 Created):**

     ```json
    {
      "id": "*5",
        "name": "api-cert",
        "common-name": "131.81.104.1",
        "days-valid": "365",
      "flags": "K"
      }
     ```

   * **Error Handling:**
        *  If there is an error with any of the parameters, the server will return a `400 Bad Request` with details in the response.
        * The response will include a detailed error message:
        ```json
        {
         "error": "bad request - days-valid: Invalid value; must be a number"
        }
        ```

**2. Set the www-ssl certificate**

  * **Endpoint**: `/ip/service`
  * **Method**: `PUT`
  * **JSON Payload**:
    ```json
    {
      "www-ssl": {
           "certificate": "api-cert"
      }
    }
    ```
    * **Expected Successful Response (200 OK):**
       ```json
        {
             "message": "done"
         }
        ```
   * **Error Handling:**
        *  If there is an error with any of the parameters, the server will return a `400 Bad Request` with details in the response.
        * The response will include a detailed error message:
        ```json
       {
           "error": "No such service - 'www-ssl'"
        }
        ```

**Note:** Ensure the API user has necessary permissions to make these changes.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passphrases:** Use strong, unique passphrases to encrypt private keys when exporting. Store them securely.
*   **Limited Access:** Restrict who can manage certificates on the MikroTik device.
*   **Regular Rotation:** Periodically rotate certificates to reduce risk if keys are ever compromised.
*   **Avoid Self-Signed Certificates for Public Use:** Self-signed certificates are prone to man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **Private Key Protection** Do not store the private key directly on the router. If you must use a certificate on a device, and that key is needed, export and re-import the key securely, and ensure it's not easily accessible.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration covers the basic lifecycle of a self-signed certificate.  However, it does not include details about CA certificates, ACME, or more advanced key management. Additionally, while the example shows an example of a cert being used on a web interface, it could be made to include certificates with VPN functionality, or for use with the API itself. Improvements include:

*   Adding detailed steps for importing CA certificates.
*   Including an example of ACME for automated certificate renewal.
*   Showing more realistic certificate use-cases like a VPN.
*   Expanding on private key storage considerations.
*   Adding details about secure APIs.
*   Adding examples for multiple user certs.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

Certificates are digital documents that bind a public key to an identity. In simple terms, they are like digital IDs that verify a party's identity, be it a website, a device, or a user. There are two main types used in MikroTik setups:
1. **Self-Signed Certificates**: These are certificates that are generated and signed by the same entity. This means that there is no trusted third-party verifier (certificate authority), and the browser will warn users that the connection is not secure.
2. **Certificate Authority (CA) Signed Certificates**: These certificates are signed by trusted third-party CAs, which verify the identity of the entity. These certificates will be trusted by browsers and are suitable for public-facing services.

The `key-usage` parameter defines the intended purpose of the certificate. Each permission allows it to be used for specific services, for example, `digital-signature`, allows the use of the certificate for verification, while `key-encipherment` allows the cert to be used for key exchange.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Self-Signed vs. CA Certificates:**
    *   **Self-Signed:** Easier to create and manage in controlled environments, but browsers will display warnings, and they are unsuitable for public-facing services due to security concerns.
    *   **CA-Signed:** Trusted by browsers, ideal for public-facing services, require more complex setup, including involving a trusted CA and usually incurring fees.
*   **Key Length:** Longer keys offer better security but have a higher processing overhead. Choose a key length based on your security requirements and device resources.
*   **Days Valid:** Longer validity means less frequent renewal, but it increases the risk if a certificate is compromised. Balance between convenience and security when choosing how long a certificate is valid.
*   **Centralized vs. Decentralized Key Storage:** Storing private keys on the router is convenient but a single point of failure. Storing them in a hardware security module increases security but adds complexity.
* **PEM vs DER** PEM is a text encoded format which can be edited with a text editor. DER is a binary encoded format which is often used for certificates on devices. RouterOS can handle both.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This documentation targets RouterOS 7.12. The command syntax remains consistent across 7.x versions. However, minor differences might exist in the GUI or output of commands in earlier RouterOS versions or different features may be introduced in more recent versions.  For older versions, the `key-usage` parameter might have slightly different options or might not even exist. Ensure to consult the specific documentation for the RouterOS version in use.

This comprehensive guide should provide you with a robust understanding of certificate management on MikroTik RouterOS 7.12.
