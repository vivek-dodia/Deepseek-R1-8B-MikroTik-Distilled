Hi,Because I can never remember how this works, I find myself using the following expressions interchangibly in order to determine whether one or more matching items exist:Code:Select allI would like to use the last option, but I don't know whether it always works as expected, nor whether these are exactly equivalent.Edit: Although I apparently can't invert the last option easily, because I "cannot logically negate nothing". Second option is just awkward. First option is a little long, but feels the most robust, as one would expect [find] to always return an array of results.

```
:if ([:len [/interface find where name="the name"]] > 0) do={} else={}

# or if used with print
:if ([:len [/interface print as-value where name="the name"]] > 0) do={} else={}
```

```
:put ({} = "")
true

:put ([:toarray ""] = "")
true
```

```
:put ([:toarray ""] = true)
false

:put ({} = true)
false

:put ([:toarray "1,2,3,4"] = true)
false

:put ({1,2,3,4} = true)
false
```

The correct method is only the first.Code:Select allStop.Too often in scripts you get strange results when using an array and comparing it to simple strings:Code:Select allTest for 3rd method:Code:Select all
