Okay, let's dive into an extensive deep dive into MikroTik RouterOS, focusing on the provided scenario and expanding into all the required areas. This is going to be comprehensive, and I'll strive to be as detailed as possible.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:** We are configuring a MikroTik router to act as one end of a point-to-point link. This router will have a single interface (ether-95) connected to the other end of the link, and will be configured with a static IPv4 address from the 113.63.111.0/24 subnet. We'll configure both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, along with common services and security considerations relevant to the scenario. We will explore many other RouterOS configuration topics as required.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**
- RouterOS 6.48 (primarily), with notes on potential version 7.x differences where relevant.
- Interface name: ether-95
- Subnet: 113.63.111.0/24
- Static IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Basic security configuration
- Practical use cases for various features

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)**

**Step 1: Accessing the Router**

*   **Winbox:**
    *   Download and install Winbox from the MikroTik website.
    *   Discover the router (using its MAC address if no IP is known).
    *   Log in with the default user (admin) and no password. Set a secure password immediately.
*   **CLI:**
    *   Connect via SSH (if enabled) or a serial console.
    *   Log in with the default user (admin) and no password. Set a secure password immediately using `system user set admin password=your_secure_password`.

**Step 2: Configuring the Interface (ether-95)**

* **Winbox**
  * On the left menu, click `Interfaces`
  * Select interface `ether-95`
  * Check `Enabled` box if not already enabled.
*   **CLI**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ethernet set ether-95 disabled=no name=ether-95
    ```
    *   `disabled=no`: Enables the interface.
    *   `name=ether-95`: Renames the interface (if necessary).

**Step 3: Configuring IPv4 Addressing**

*   **Winbox**
    *   Navigate to `IP > Addresses`.
    *   Click `Add` (plus symbol).
    *   Enter the address, e.g., `113.63.111.2/24` in the address field.
    *   Select `ether-95` in the interface drop-down.
    *   Click `OK`.
*   **CLI**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=113.63.111.2/24 interface=ether-95
    ```
    *   `address`: The IPv4 address with CIDR notation (e.g., `113.63.111.2/24`).
    *   `interface`: The interface to assign the address to.

**Step 4: Configuring IPv6 Addressing**

* **Winbox**
    * Navigate to `IP > IPv6 > Addresses`
    * Click `Add` (plus symbol).
    * Enter the address e.g. `2001:db8::2/64`
    * Select `ether-95` in the interface dropdown
    * Click `OK`
*   **CLI**
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::2/64 interface=ether-95
    ```
    *   `address`: The IPv6 address with CIDR notation (e.g., `2001:db8::2/64`).
    *   `interface`: The interface to assign the address to.

**Step 5: Basic Firewall Rules (Winbox and CLI)**

* **Winbox**
    *   Navigate to `IP > Firewall`
    *   Click `Filter Rules`
    *   Add at least 2 rules:
        1.  Allow established/related connections
        2.  Drop invalid connections
    *   Add more rules to suit your specific scenario
*   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow established/related"
    add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop comment="Drop invalid connections"
    ```
    *   `chain=input`:  Applies the rule to incoming packets to the router.
    *   `connection-state=established,related`: Allows traffic related to existing connections.
    *   `connection-state=invalid`: Drops packets with invalid connection states.
    *   `action=accept`: Allows the traffic.
    *   `action=drop`: Blocks the traffic.

**Step 6: (Optional) Setting Up a Default Route for IPv4**

*   **Winbox**
    *   Navigate to `IP > Routes`
    *   Click `Add`
    *   Enter the gateway address, e.g., `113.63.111.1` if your upstream router is that address
    *   Click `OK`
*   **CLI**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=113.63.111.1
    ```
    * `dst-address=0.0.0.0/0`: Destination is any IP
    * `gateway`: IP of the router where traffic should be sent.

**Step 7: (Optional) Setting up a default route for IPv6**

*   **Winbox**
    *   Navigate to `IP > IPv6 > Routes`
    *   Click `Add`
    *   Enter the gateway address, e.g., `fe80::1` if your upstream router is that address
    *   Click `OK`
*   **CLI**
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 route add dst-address=::/0 gateway=fe80::1
    ```

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

```

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall:** Incorrectly specifying the interface or subnet mask.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip address print` to check configured addresses and interfaces.
*   **Pitfall:** Firewall rules blocking connectivity.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip firewall filter print` to review rules and `/tool torch` on the relevant interface to inspect packet flow.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrectly configured default route.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip route print` to check route configuration.
*   **Error Scenario:** Duplicate IP address conflict. The MikroTik router will log this. Use `/log print` to check for errors and change the IP address.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 113.63.111.1
    /ping 2001:db8::1
    ```
*   **Traceroute:**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 113.63.111.1
    /tool traceroute 2001:db8::1
    ```
*   **Torch:**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether-95
    ```
    * Use `torch` to see live packet flow on the interface. Filter for specific IPs or protocols.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools:** For assigning dynamic IP addresses. Useful in more complex setups with DHCP servers.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=my_pool ranges=192.168.10.10-192.168.10.254
    ```
*   **IP Routing:**  Static, dynamic protocols (OSPF, RIP, BGP).  MikroTik supports VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) for complex multi-tenant or overlapping networks.
*   **IP Settings:** Configure features like TCP/UDP timeouts, ICMP settings.
*  **MAC server:** Allows discovery and management of devices by MAC address.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool mac-server set enabled=yes
    ```
    ```mikrotik
    /tool mac-server print
    ```
    * Allows discovery of the router's neighbors by MAC address
*   **RoMON:** MikroTik's Router Management Protocol. Enables managing multiple MikroTik devices from one central location. Useful for large deployments.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool romon set enabled=yes
    ```
*   **Winbox:** Windows GUI for router management. Very popular and user-friendly.
*   **Certificates:**  Used for secure connections (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs). Create and import/export certificates.
*   **PPP AAA, RADIUS:** User authentication and authorization for PPPoE/VPN clients. RADIUS is used for external authentication.
*   **User/User groups:** User access control on the router. Assign different privileges to different users.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples (Partial)**

*   **Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Method:** `POST` (Create) / `GET` (Read) / `PUT` (Update) / `DELETE`
*  **Example POST (Add an IP address)**
    ```json
    {
        "address": "192.168.10.5/24",
        "interface": "ether-95",
        "disabled": false
    }
    ```
    * To create this using the API, you will need to send an HTTP `POST` request to `https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address` with the JSON payload above. You will also need to configure the API security appropriately.
*  **Example GET (Get a list of IP addresses)**
   * You would need to send an HTTP `GET` request to `https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address`. The API should return the following json payload:
    ```json
    [
        {
            ".id": "*0",
            "address": "113.63.111.2/24",
            "interface": "ether-95",
            "network": "113.63.111.0",
            "actual-interface": "ether-95",
            "dynamic": "no",
            "invalid": "no"
        },
        {
            ".id": "*1",
            "address": "2001:db8::2/64",
            "interface": "ether-95",
            "network": "2001:db8::",
            "actual-interface": "ether-95",
            "dynamic": "no",
            "invalid": "no"
        }
    ]
    ```
    * This is the default response from the router. The API will provide additional fields depending on the IP addresses that are defined in the system.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** Connects interfaces at Layer 2, acting like a switch. Use to allow devices on different interfaces to be in the same broadcast domain.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge add name=my-bridge
    /interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether1
    /interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=wlan1
    ```
*   **Routing:** Determines the path for packets based on destination IP address.  MikroTik supports both static and dynamic routing.
    *   Static routing: Manual routes added by the user.
    *   Dynamic routing: Routes are learned using routing protocols.
*   **Firewall:** Protects the router and network from unauthorized access.  Uses rules to allow/deny traffic.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Change the default password immediately.**
*   **Disable unnecessary services.**
*   **Use strong passwords.**
*   **Limit access to management interfaces.**
*   **Use firewall rules to restrict access to the router.**
*   **Keep RouterOS updated to patch security vulnerabilities.**
*   **Use certificates for secure connections.**

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples**

This is the most substantial part. Below, we will cover each listed topic with explanations and examples.

**IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)**
  *   **IPv4:** Four octets, commonly written as dotted decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each octet is 8-bits, resulting in a 32 bit address.
      *   **Private IPv4 Addresses:** These are IP address ranges that are reserved for use in private networks. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16.
      *  **Public IPv4 Addresses:** These are IP addresses that are allocated for public internet usage.
   *   **IPv6:** Uses 128-bit addresses, commonly written in hexadecimal separated by colons (e.g., 2001:db8::1).
        *   **Global Unicast Addresses:** Public, routable address (2000::/3)
        *   **Unique Local Unicast Addresses (ULA):** Similar to private IPv4 addresses, but on a much larger scale (fc00::/7).
        *   **Link-Local Addresses:** Used for local communication within a network segment (fe80::/10).
   * **Configuration:**
      * Already covered above, see examples using `/ip address` and `/ipv6 address`
  * **Limitations:**
     * IPv4 exhaustion. There are only 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses which is not enough to assign to every device that needs internet access.
     * IPv6 adoption is still not ubiquitous, and may require changes to old network equipment.

**IP Pools**
    * Used to assign IP addresses dynamically to devices
    * Syntax
        * `/ip pool add name=<pool-name> ranges=<ip_range>`
    * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip pool add name=my_dhcp_pool ranges=192.168.20.100-192.168.20.200
        ```
   * The IP pool can be referenced by other features such as DHCP Server.
  * **Limitations:**
    * Requires using another service, like DHCP, to assign them.
    * Can be confusing if not properly configured.

**IP Routing**
  *   **Static Routing:** Manually configured routes. Good for small, static networks.
        * Syntax `/ip route add dst-address=<destination>/<prefix-length> gateway=<gateway_address>`
    * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip route add dst-address=192.168.50.0/24 gateway=192.168.10.1
        ```
        * This will route traffic destined to `192.168.50.0/24` to the `192.168.10.1` gateway address.
  *   **Dynamic Routing:** Routes learned via routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, BGP). Used for larger, more complex networks.
      * See more details about Dynamic Routing further down in the documentation.
    *   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** Allows multiple routing tables to coexist on a single router, useful for multi-tenancy.
        *  Requires interfaces to be added to VRF.
  *   **Limitations:**
      * Incorrect configuration of static routes can cause routing loops or blackholes.
      * Dynamic routing can be complex to set up and troubleshoot.

**IP Settings**
  *   Allows configuration of various networking parameters, including TCP/UDP timeouts, ICMP settings, etc.
   *  Syntax:
      *   `/ip settings set <parameter=value>`
   * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip settings set tcp-syn-sent-timeout=10s tcp-finwait-timeout=20s
        ```
        *  Set the TCP SYN timeout to 10 seconds and FIN-WAIT timeout to 20 seconds.
  * **Limitations:**
      * Can be overwhelming due to large number of options.
      * Changes can have a negative performance impact if configured incorrectly.

**MAC server**
  *   Allows the discovery of MAC addresses on connected networks.
  *   Used for discovery of devices.
  *   Syntax:
      *   `/tool mac-server set enabled=<yes/no>`
  *   Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /tool mac-server set enabled=yes
        ```
      *  This will turn on the MAC server
        ```mikrotik
        /tool mac-server print
        ```
       * This command will display information about MAC server
        ```mikrotik
        /tool mac-scan interface=ether1
        ```
        * This will scan `ether1` for MAC addresses
   * **Limitations:**
       * MAC addresses can be spoofed.
       * Can be disabled by device configuration.

**RoMON**
    *   MikroTik's Router Management Protocol.
    *   Enables centralized management of MikroTik devices.
    *   Requires that both the RoMON server and client be enabled.
    *   Syntax:
        *   `/tool romon set enabled=<yes/no>`
    *   Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon set enabled=yes
        /tool romon set id=my_romon_id
        ```
        *   These commands turn on romon and set the ID to `my_romon_id`.
  * **Limitations:**
      * Can be a security risk if not configured carefully.
      * Needs a dedicated management network.

**WinBox**
  *   Windows GUI for router management.
  *   Easy to use and good for beginners.
    * Download from MikroTik website
    * Connect using MAC address or IP address.
  * **Limitations:**
    * Windows only.
    * Some advanced configurations are easier to perform through CLI.

**Certificates**
  *   Used for secure connections (VPN, HTTPS).
  *   Create self-signed certificates or import from a certificate authority.
  * Syntax:
    * `/certificate add name=<certificate_name>`
  * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /certificate add name=my_cert common-name=example.com
        /certificate sign my_cert
        ```
     * The first command creates a self-signed certificate.
     * The second command will generate the signing key for the certificate
  * **Limitations:**
      * Can be complex to configure correctly.
      * Certificate management requires careful planning.

**PPP AAA**
  * Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for PPP connections (PPPoE, PPTP, L2TP).
  * Used to control access to resources.
  * Requires setting up PPP profiles and secrets.
    * Syntax:
       * `/ppp secret add name=<username> password=<password> service=<ppp_service> profile=<profile>`
  * **Limitations:**
      *   Requires careful planning to configure user management.

**RADIUS**
  *   Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service.
  *   External authentication server.
  *   Syntax:
    *   `/radius add address=<ip_address> secret=<secret>`
  * Example:
    ```mikrotik
    /radius add address=192.168.10.20 secret=my_radius_secret
    ```
  * **Limitations:**
       * Requires an external RADIUS server.
       * Configuration can be complex.

**User / User groups**
  *   Access control to the router.
  *   Define users with different access levels.
  *   Syntax:
    *   `/user add name=<username> password=<password> group=<group>`
    *   `/user group add name=<group_name> policy=<policy>`
  *   Example:
       ```mikrotik
      /user add name=my_admin password=my_password group=full
      /user group add name=readonly policy=read
      ```
  * **Limitations:**
        * If not done correctly, it can leave the router exposed.

**Bridging and Switching**
  *   **Bridging:** Connects interfaces at Layer 2, acting like a switch. Devices on bridge are in the same network segment.
        * Syntax:
        * `/interface bridge add name=<bridge_name>`
        * `/interface bridge port add bridge=<bridge_name> interface=<interface_name>`
    * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface bridge add name=my_lan_bridge
        /interface bridge port add bridge=my_lan_bridge interface=ether1
        /interface bridge port add bridge=my_lan_bridge interface=ether2
        ```
  *  **Switching:** MikroTik switches also have Layer 2 hardware capabilities and can perform switching at Layer 2 without needing the CPU
  * **Limitations:**
     * Bridging introduces overhead since traffic has to be handled by CPU.
     * Can cause broadcast storms if not properly configured.

**MACVLAN**
   *  Create virtual interfaces that share the MAC address of another interface.
   *  Useful for connecting virtual machines to a physical network.
  * Syntax:
     * `/interface macvlan add interface=<interface_name> mac-address=<mac_address> disabled=<yes/no>`
  *  Example:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface macvlan add interface=ether1 mac-address=02:03:04:05:06:07
    ```
  * **Limitations:**
     * MACVLAN is limited to the hardware and software of the device it's running on.
     * Cannot be used on virtual interfaces.

**L3 Hardware Offloading**
   *   Moves packet processing from the CPU to the switch chip.
   *  Improves performance and reduces CPU load
   *   Available only on devices with hardware switching capabilities.
  *   Syntax:
     * `/interface ethernet set ether1 hw=yes` (Example, turn on hardware offloading for ether1)
  * **Limitations:**
      * Not all features are compatible with hardware offloading.
      * May require specific configuration

**MACsec**
    *   Media Access Control Security.
    *   Provides link layer encryption for Ethernet networks.

       * `/interface macsec add name=<interface_name> interface=<underlying_interface_name> key=<hexadecimal_key>`
    * Example:
      ```mikrotik
      /interface macsec add name=macsec-ether1 interface=ether1 key=0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f
      ```
    *   Requires a pre-shared key configured at both ends.
   * **Limitations:**
        * Not all hardware support MACsec
        * Requires a secure key exchange mechanism.

**Quality of Service (QoS)**
    * Allows prioritizing specific traffic.
    *   Can prevent bandwidth starvation.
    *   Improves user experience.
    *   Includes:
        * **Queues**: Traffic management tool to prioritize traffic.
            * Syntax:
                 * `/queue simple add name=<queue_name> target=<ip_address/subnet> max-limit=<bandwidth>`
          * Example:
              ```mikrotik
                /queue simple add name=my_web_queue target=192.168.1.0/24 max-limit=2M
                ```
              * This sets up a simple queue for any device in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet, with a maximum speed limit of 2Mbps
        * **Connection Tracking:** Tracks active network connections for better firewall control.
           * Enabled by default.
           * Can be adjusted using `/ip settings`.
        * **Firewall (See detailed documentation below)**
        * **Packet Flow in RouterOS**
          * Ingress (received), Routing, egress (sent).
          * Firewall chains filter packets at different stages of the flow.
    *   **Firewall and QoS Case Studies:**
        * Prioritize VoIP traffic.
        * Limit bandwidth for specific users/applications.
        * Rate-limit torrent downloads.
        * Create different classes of service.
    *   **Kid Control:** Use firewall to restrict internet access based on schedules or websites.
    *   **UPnP:** (Universal Plug and Play) Allow devices on the local network to configure the router for port forwarding (e.g., game consoles)
         * `/ip upnp set enabled=yes allow-disable-external-interface=no`
         * Enable UPnP with external interface disablement.
    *   **NAT-PMP:** (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) Similar to UPnP, but with enhanced security.
   * **Limitations:**
         * Can be complex to set up correctly.
         * Incorrect configuration can cause performance issues or unexpected traffic patterns.

**Switch Chip Features**
  *   Many MikroTik devices have integrated switch chips for hardware-based L2 switching.
  *  Can offload much of the switching work from the CPU.
  *   **VLAN Support**:
     * Can configure VLANs using the switch chip
    * Example:
      ```mikrotik
       /interface ethernet set ether2 vlan-mode=use-tag vlan-id=100
        ```
  *   **Limitations:**
        *   Not all devices have switch chips.
        *   Features depend on the specific switch chip implementation.

**VLAN**
   * Virtual Local Area Networks.
   *   Segment a network logically without needing physical separation.
   *   Can increase security by segmenting different kinds of traffic.
   *  Syntax:
        * `/interface vlan add name=<vlan_name> vlan-id=<vlan_id> interface=<underlying_interface>`
   * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan add name=vlan100 vlan-id=100 interface=ether1
        ```
        *   Creates a VLAN interface with id `100` using the `ether1` interface.

**Firewall and Quality of Service (Including: Connection tracking, Firewall, Packet Flow in RouterOS, Queues, Firewall and QoS Case Studies, Kid Control, UPnP, NAT-PMP)**
  * **Firewall**:
       * Protects the router and network from unauthorized access.
       * Uses rules to allow/deny traffic.
       * Different types of chains that apply to incoming (input), outgoing (output) and routed (forward) traffic.
       * Syntax:
          * `/ip firewall filter add chain=<chain_name> src-address=<ip_address/subnet> dst-address=<ip_address/subnet> action=<action>`
       * Example:
          ```mikrotik
            /ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=22 action=drop
            ```
           * Blocks incoming TCP connections on port 22.
  * **Connection Tracking**:
        * Keeps track of active network connections.
        * Used to allow related traffic.
        * Can be adjusted using `/ip settings`
   * **Packet Flow in RouterOS**
        * The firewall rules are checked at different stages during packet processing.
        * Ingress (received), Routing, egress (sent).
   * **Queues**:
        * Traffic management tool to prioritize traffic.
        * Can use various queue algorithms.
       * See Examples above.
   * **Firewall and QoS Case Studies**:
        * Prioritizing VoIP traffic.
        * Limit bandwidth for specific users/applications.
        * Rate-limit torrent downloads.
        * Create different classes of service.
   * **Kid Control**:
        * Time-based internet access limits.
        * Website blocking.
        * Implemented using firewall rules.
   * **UPnP:**
        * Allows devices on local network to auto-configure NAT rules.
        * Can be a security risk if not configured carefully.
  * **NAT-PMP:**
        * Similar to UPnP.
        * Can be used to expose services on the local network to external networks.
  * **Limitations:**
        * Overly complex firewalls can cause performance issues.
        * Incorrect firewall rules can block legitimate traffic or create vulnerabilities.
        * Inappropriate QoS settings can starve important traffic of bandwidth.

**IP Services (DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy)**

*   **DHCP Server:**
    * Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices.
    * Syntax:
       * `/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=<pool_name> interface=<interface_name>`
   * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=my_dhcp_pool interface=my_lan_bridge
        /ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.20.0/24 gateway=192.168.20.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8
        ```
*   **DNS Server:**
    * Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
    * Syntax:
         * `/ip dns set servers=<dns_server_ips>`
    * Example:
         ```mikrotik
            /ip dns set servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
            ```
        *  Sets the router to use Google DNS
*   **SOCKS Proxy:**
    * Used to route traffic through a proxy server.
    * Syntax:
       * `/ip socks add enabled=yes`
    * Example:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip socks set enabled=yes
        ```
        * Enables SOCKS proxy server
*   **Proxy:**
     * Web proxy to cache and filter content.
    * Syntax:
       * `/ip proxy set enabled=yes`
    * Example:
       ```mikrotik
         /ip proxy set enabled=yes
         /ip proxy access add dst-address=example.com action=deny
        ```
        *   Enables web proxy and blocks access to example.com.
*   **Limitations:**
    * Incorrect DHCP configuration can cause IP conflicts.
    * DNS performance can impact internet browsing experience.
    * Proxies can impact performance if not configured correctly.

    * MikroTik can do ECMP, PCC etc.
        *  ECMP = Equal Cost Multi Path: uses multiple routes with the same cost
        *  PCC = Per Connection Classifier: allows distributing connections based on IP address, port etc.
*   **Bonding:**
    *  Combines multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface.
    * Improves bandwidth and redundancy.
    * Syntax:

         ```
         * Creates bonding interface that combine ether1 and ether2 using 802.3ad.
*   **HA Case Studies:**
    * Dual router setups for failover.
    * Load balancing for web servers.
*  **Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group (MLAG):**
   *   Connects two or more routers for increased redundancy.
   *   Requires both routers to act as one logical unit.
*  **VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)**
  * Allows multiple routers to share one virtual IP address
  * Syntax:
     * `/interface vrrp add name=<vrrp_name> interface=<interface_name> vrid=<vrid> priority=<priority> virtual-address=<virtual_ip_address>`
