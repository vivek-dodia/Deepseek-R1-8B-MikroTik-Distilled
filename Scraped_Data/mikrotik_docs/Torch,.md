MikroTik Torch is a real-time traffic monitoring tool that can be used to monitor the traffic flow through an interface.Watch ourvideo about this feature.
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/torch
```
You can monitor traffic classified by:
* source address (IPv4 and IPv6);
* destination address (IPv4 and IPv6);
* port;
* protocol;
* mac-protocol;
* VLAN ID;
* mac-address;
* DSCP;
MikroTik Torch shows the protocols you have chosen and the TX/RX data rate for each of them on the particular interface.
