Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive documentation for MikroTik RouterOS, focusing on IP addressing with the provided context, and then expanding to cover all the specified topics. This will be extensive, so we'll break it down logically.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:**

We need to configure a MikroTik router for a small office or home office (SOHO) network. The specific requirement is to assign an IPv4 address to the interface `ether-2`. The network will use a private subnet within the range of 122.86.63.0/24.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (compatible with 6.48 and 7.x)
*   **Configuration Level:** Basic (though we will touch on more advanced concepts)
*   **Network Scale:** SOHO
*   **Subnet:** 122.86.63.0/24
*   **Interface:** `ether-2`
*   **IP Address:**  Assign `122.86.63.2/24` to `ether-2` as a static address.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation using CLI and Winbox**

**CLI Implementation**

1.  **Open a Terminal:** Connect to your MikroTik router via SSH, console, or the WebFig interface and open a new terminal.

2.  **Add IP Address:** Use the following command to configure the IP address on `ether-2`:

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=122.86.63.2/24 interface=ether-2
    ```

    *   `address=122.86.63.2/24`: Specifies the IP address and subnet mask using CIDR notation.
    *   `interface=ether-2`: Specifies the interface to assign the IP address to.

**Winbox Implementation**

1.  **Connect to Router:** Connect to your MikroTik router using Winbox.

2.  **Navigate to IP Addresses:** Go to `IP > Addresses` in the left-hand menu.

3.  **Add New Address:** Click the `+` button.

4.  **Configure Address:**

    *   **Address:** Enter `122.86.63.2/24`.
    *   **Interface:** Select `ether-2` from the dropdown.

5.  **Apply Changes:** Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands with Relevant Parameters**

```mikrotik
# Set IP Address on ether-2
/ip address add address=122.86.63.2/24 interface=ether-2 comment="SOHO network address"

# Example of setting an IPv6 Address
/ip address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=ether-2 comment="SOHO IPv6 Address"

# Enable IPv6 (if needed)
/ipv6 settings set disable-ipv6=no

# Remove IP Address
/ip address remove [find address=122.86.63.2/24]

# View existing IP Addresses
/ip address print

# View interfaces
/interface print
```

*   **`/ip address add`**: The main command for adding a new IP address.
    *   `address`:  The IP address and subnet mask (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24`).
    *   `interface`: The interface to which the IP will be assigned.
    *   `network`:  (optional) Automatically sets the network address if the address is specified without a subnet.
    *   `comment`: A human-readable comment for this address configuration.
    *    `disabled`:  Disables or enables the configuration.

*   **`/ip address remove`**: Removes an existing IP address.
    *   `[find ...]`:  A dynamic find function used to locate the correct IP configuration entry.

*    **`/ip address print`**: Lists all existing configured IP addresses.
    *   `detail`:  Shows the detailed configuration of all addresses.

*    **`/interface print`**: Lists all available interfaces on the Router.

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** A common error is using the wrong subnet mask, which can lead to devices not being able to communicate. Always double-check the subnet mask.
*   **Conflicting IP Addresses:** Ensure that no other device on the same network is using the same IP address.
*   **Interface Mismatch:** Make sure the IP address is configured on the correct interface.
*   **Firewall Issues:** Sometimes, a firewall rule might be blocking communication. Ensure there are no restrictive rules in `IP > Firewall` that block traffic on this subnet.
*   **Disabled Interface:** Double check if the interface is enabled by using  `/interface print` and verifying that `disabled` is set to `no`.
*   **Address Already Exists:** If you try to add an address that already exists on an interface, the router will error.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Ping:** Use `/ping <IP address>` to verify connectivity to devices on the subnet.
*   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=ether-2` to monitor real-time network traffic. This can help identify whether traffic is flowing or not.
*   **Traceroute:** Use `/tool traceroute <IP address>` to trace the path to a destination, and detect possible bottlenecks.
*   **Log:** Check the logs (`/system logging print`) for any error messages related to IP addresses or the interface.

**Error Examples:**

```mikrotik
# Error: IP address already exists on interface
> /ip address add address=122.86.63.2/24 interface=ether-2
failed to add ip address - duplicate address
```

```mikrotik
# Error: Interface not found
> /ip address add address=122.86.63.2/24 interface=ether-3
failed to add ip address - invalid value for argument interface: ether-3
```

**5. Verification and Testing**

1.  **Ping Test:**  After configuring the IP address, ping a device on the same subnet to verify connectivity:

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 122.86.63.10
    ```

2.  **Torch:** Start `torch` on `ether-2` to monitor traffic:

    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether-2
    ```

    Look for ICMP (ping) traffic. This helps ensure traffic is not being blocked.
3. **Interface Check:** Check status of the interface using `/interface print`. Make sure that the interface is up and running.
4.  **IP Address List:** Verify your IP address is in the output with `/ip address print`.
5.  **Traceroute:** Use `/tool traceroute 122.86.63.10` to trace the path if you are trying to test connectivity outside the local network.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools:** Used to dynamically assign IP addresses (e.g., with DHCP server). We will cover this later in detail.
*   **Multiple IP Addresses:** MikroTik supports having multiple IP addresses on the same interface. This is used for more advanced scenarios.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** Used to group multiple interfaces together as a single Layer 2 broadcast domain. Traffic is forwarded based on MAC addresses. (`/interface bridge`). This is used to connect multiple networks into a larger LAN segment.
*   **Routing:** The process of forwarding packets between different networks based on IP addresses. This is used to connect a network to an external provider such as an ISP. (`/ip route`). MikroTik supports static and dynamic routing protocols.
*   **Firewall:** A key security component that controls network access based on predefined rules. (`/ip firewall`). It filters traffic based on source/destination IP, port, and protocol. It provides protection against malicious network activity.

    *   **Connection Tracking:** `/ip firewall connection` keeps track of ongoing connections. It tracks TCP/UDP sessions and uses this information to manage subsequent packets from that session.
    *   **Packet Flow in RouterOS:**  Packets pass through several stages of processing, including input, forward, and output chains in the firewall. You can intercept packets in each chain.
*  **IP Addressing:** IP addresses are logical identifiers used to locate devices on a network. They can be static (manually configured) or dynamic (assigned by a DHCP server). IPv4 addressing is still most common but IPv6 is required for the future.
* **Subnet:** Subnets allow to divide large networks into smaller manageable portions. They divide IP addresses into two parts: a network part and a host part.
* **CIDR:** Classless Inter-Domain Routing, allows more flexible management of IP address space and more efficient routing.
*  **Layer 2 vs Layer 3:**  Layer 2 deals with MAC addresses at the data link layer; layer 3 with IP addressing at the network layer.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Change Default Password:** The first thing you should do is change the default username (`admin`) and password on a MikroTik router.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services you're not using (e.g., API, telnet, www). `/ip service print`
*   **Firewall Rules:** Use strong firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
*   **Secure Winbox:** Enable `Allow Secure API` in `IP > Services`.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS updated to the latest stable release for security fixes. `/system package update`
*   **Limit API Access:** Restrict API access using `/ip firewall` rules.
*   **Disable Unused interfaces** disable all unused interfaces using `/interface set <interface> disabled=yes`
