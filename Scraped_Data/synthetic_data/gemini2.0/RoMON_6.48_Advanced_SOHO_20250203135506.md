Okay, let's dive into a detailed technical documentation for RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) on MikroTik RouterOS 6.48 within a SOHO environment, focusing on the `wlan-26` interface and a 115.9.88.0/24 subnet.

## Scenario Description:

We aim to implement RoMON on a MikroTik router, using the `wlan-26` interface, to enable secure, out-of-band management access to other MikroTik devices on the same local network, independent of the primary IP network.  This is useful when primary network access is disrupted or for more secure management access. This scenario assumes other MikroTik devices are also set up for RoMON on the same broadcast domain.

## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Enable RoMON globally on the router.
**Before:** RoMON is disabled by default.
**Action:** Enable the RoMON service globally.
**Why:** RoMON needs to be globally enabled before it can be configured on specific interfaces.
**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/tool romon set enabled=yes
```
**Winbox GUI:**
   - Navigate to `Tools` -> `RoMON`.
   - Check the `Enabled` checkbox.
**After:** Global RoMON service is enabled.
**Expected Effect:** No network changes yet, but the RoMON service is now active.

### Step 2: Enable RoMON on the `wlan-26` interface.
**Before:** RoMON is not running on the `wlan-26` interface.
**Action:**  Enable RoMON on the `wlan-26` interface.
**Why:** This step specifies the interface for which RoMON will be active.
**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/interface romon add interface=wlan-26
```
**Winbox GUI:**
  - Navigate to `Tools` -> `RoMON` -> `Interfaces` tab.
  - Click `+` to add a new entry.
  - Select `wlan-26` in the `Interface` drop-down.
  - Click `OK`.
**After:** RoMON is enabled on the `wlan-26` interface.
**Expected Effect:** The router will now begin participating in the RoMON network on the `wlan-26` interface and will discover other RoMON capable routers on the same L2 network, regardless of IP configuration.

### Step 3: Set a unique RoMON ID (Optional, but strongly recommended).
**Before:** By default, the RoMON ID is based on the Router's MAC address, which can be identical on a large deployment of a model, causing conflicts.
**Action:** Set a custom RoMON ID for ease of management and to avoid collisions in larger networks.
**Why:** To uniquely identify this router on the RoMON network, especially if more routers are in the same L2 domain, thus avoiding collisions and confusion.
**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/tool romon set id=router-wlan-26-test
```
**Winbox GUI:**
 - Navigate to `Tools` -> `RoMON`.
 - In the `ID` field, enter your desired unique ID (e.g., `router-wlan-26-test`).
 - Click `Apply` or `OK`.
**After:** The router now uses a custom RoMON ID.
**Expected Effect:** When RoMON is used to discover other devices, this new id will be what it identifies this device as, and the RoMON routing calculations will use this id.

### Step 4: (Optional) Set a specific RoMON password.
**Before:** By default, there is no password for RoMON discovery.
**Action:** Set a RoMON password to secure RoMON access.
**Why:** Setting a RoMON password adds security, prevents unauthorized users from using RoMON to manage your device, or using RoMON to interfere with the network.
**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/tool romon set password=your_secure_romon_password
```
**Winbox GUI:**
 - Navigate to `Tools` -> `RoMON`.
 - Enter a password in the `Password` field.
 - Click `Apply` or `OK`.
**After:** RoMON will now require authentication to discover the device.
**Expected Effect:** Other devices attempting to use the RoMON connection from this router will require the configured password.

## Complete Configuration Commands:
```mikrotik
/tool romon set enabled=yes
/interface romon add interface=wlan-26
/tool romon set id=router-wlan-26-test
/tool romon set password=your_secure_romon_password
```
**Explanation of Parameters:**

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:**  RoMON not discovering other devices.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure RoMON is enabled globally on all devices.
        *   Verify that the same interface(s) are used for RoMON on each devices.
        *   Double-check if the RoMON password is configured and that all devices use the same password if set.
        *  Ensure that all devices are on the same L2 network as this device. RoMON is an L2 protocol and cannot route over L3 networks.
        *  Use the `/tool romon neighbors print` command to check if any other RoMON devices are detected.
*   **Problem:** RoMON connection instability.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Check the physical link quality of the interface involved, in our example wlan-26.
        *  Ensure the device has sufficient resources available to perform the RoMON calculations.

*   **Problem:** RoMON id conflicts.
     *   **Solution:**
          *   Ensure all devices have unique RoMON ids.

*  **Problem:** RoMON Password mismatch
     *   **Solution:**
          *   Ensure all devices use the same password, or none, for RoMON access.

*   **Security Note:**  Using RoMON without a password is not recommended in a production environment. The password is sent as clear text on the network, so it is recommended to enable RoMON over secure interfaces such as VPNs.

## Verification and Testing Steps:
1.  **Enable RoMON on a second device.** Follow the same instructions as above for another device, using the same password if set, and with a different RoMON id.
2.  **Use `/tool romon neighbors print`:** On the original device, run this command to see if the second device is discovered.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool romon neighbors print
    ```
    **Expected Output:** You should see the second device with its ID, interface, MAC address, and uptime details.

3.  **Connect to the other router via RoMON using Winbox:**
    * Open Winbox.
    * Click on "Connect to RoMON".
    * Click on discover and select the second router that you enabled RoMON on.
    * Connect using your username and password.
    * Verify that the connection works and that you are able to manage the second router via RoMON.
4.  **Ping the second router via RoMON using `/tool romon ping`.**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool romon ping id=second_routers_romon_id count=3
    ```
    *  `id`: The ID of the router you want to ping.
    *   `count`: The number of ping packets to send.
    **Expected Output:** You should see successful ping replies from the second router.
5.  **Traceroute via RoMON using `/tool romon traceroute`.**
   ```mikrotik
    /tool romon traceroute id=second_routers_romon_id
    ```
   **Expected Output:** You should see a trace to the second router.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **RoMON on multiple interfaces:** You can enable RoMON on multiple interfaces for redundancy and flexibility.
*   **RoMON and VLANs:** RoMON can operate over VLANs as long as the same VLAN is tagged on both ends.
*   **Monitoring using SNMP:** You can monitor the RoMON status and discovered neighbors via SNMP.
*   **Security:** RoMON can be used for out of band management, and used in combination with VLANs, VPNs and firewalls can provide additional security.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

RoMON configurations are generally not managed via the REST API in the same direct way as interfaces or IP addresses. RoMON data is mostly read-only or managed with direct commands. However, we can use the API to retrieve RoMON neighbor information.

**Example API call to get RoMON neighbors:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/tool/romon/neighbors`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Payload:** No JSON payload is required for a GET operation
*   **Example using Curl (assuming API login session):**
```bash
curl -H "X-Csrf-Token: YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN" \
     -k \
     -u 'username:password' \
     "https://your_mikrotik_ip/rest/tool/romon/neighbors"
```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**

    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "router-wlan-26-test",
        "interface": "wlan-26",
        "mac-address": "01:23:45:67:89:AB",
        "uptime": "1h10m20s",
        "version": "6.48",
       "discovered-at" : "2024-06-20 14:30:00"
      },
      {
        "id": "router-wlan-27-test",
        "interface": "wlan-27",
        "mac-address": "02:34:56:78:9A:BC",
        "uptime": "3h40m10s",
        "version": "7.12.1",
        "discovered-at" : "2024-06-20 15:30:00"
      }
    ]
    ```
* **API Error Handling:** If the `X-Csrf-Token` is missing or invalid, the API will respond with a 403 Forbidden error. Ensure you have a valid token from a successful login request.
* **Note**: The Mikrotik API is quite broad and is recommended to use `https://api.mt.lv` for more documentation.

## Security Best Practices

*   **RoMON Password:** Use a strong, unique password for RoMON authentication.
*   **Interface Selection:** Carefully choose which interfaces to enable RoMON on, avoiding exposure to untrusted networks if possible.
*  **Limited Exposure:** Restrict RoMON access to a dedicated network segment.
*  **Monitoring:** Monitor RoMON connections for unusual access.
*  **Keep up to date:** Keep your RouterOS device up to date with the latest security releases, especially when working with low level protocols.
*  **VPN**: Using a VPN for your management network can help secure management traffic.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Improvement:** Implement more complex RoMON usage scenarios, such as multiple VLANs, and bridging with other management networks.
*   **Improvement:** Add more security considerations, such as how to use RoMON within a VLAN/VPN setup.
*   **Improvement:** Demonstrate the use of MikroTik's netwatch tool to monitor RoMON availability.
*  **Improvement:** Add configurations for RouterOS version 7.x, along with relevant command differences.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic
**RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network):**

RoMON is a MikroTik-specific Layer 2 discovery and management protocol. It operates independently from the traditional IP network and is used primarily for out-of-band management and discovery of MikroTik routers on the same Layer 2 broadcast domain. This allows a user to discover and connect to other MikroTik devices, regardless of whether IP connectivity exists between devices.

**Key Benefits of RoMON:**

*   **Out-of-Band Management:** Manage MikroTik routers when IP connectivity is unavailable or unreliable.
*   **Simplified Discovery:** Automatically discover other MikroTik devices on the local network.
*   **Secure Connection:** RoMON can be password-protected, adding a layer of security.
*  **RouterOS recovery**: RoMON can often be used to recover connectivity to MikroTik devices if misconfigured IP configurations have made traditional IP based management unavailable.

**How RoMON Works:**

RoMON uses a proprietary discovery protocol which sends and receives L2 frames that contain information about the device such as it's RoMON ID, mac address, and version. Routers participating in a RoMON network will discover each other by this mechanism. RoMON uses a best-path algorithm to decide the route to other devices, similar to routing protocols. RoMON discovery and communication occurs within Layer 2 broadcast domains, and will not function over Layer 3 networks.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **RoMON vs. Regular IP Management:** RoMON provides out-of-band management, useful when regular IP management fails, but it's not intended to replace normal IP management. RoMON does not require IP configurations, but is not routable.  IP routing is necessary for remote access outside of the L2 broadcast domain.
*   **RoMON with and without passwords:** Without a password, RoMON is easy to use, but less secure. With a password, it's more secure but requires that all devices that participate in the network have the same RoMON password.
*   **Multiple RoMON interfaces vs. One interface:** Multiple interfaces allow redundancy, but might cause unnecessary processing overhead. Only enable RoMON on interfaces that are needed for your management network.
*  **RoMON Id vs mac address**: RoMON Id is a user settable id, instead of using the devices default MAC address as an id. This is recommended to avoid id conflicts within large MikroTik networks.
*   **RoMON complexity vs simplicity**: RoMON configurations should be kept simple when possible, as there are fewer configuration options than routing protocols, and misconfiguration can cause communication issues.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The above instructions and CLI commands are primarily targeted towards RouterOS 6.48 (6.x). For RouterOS 7.x, the commands are essentially the same, and the behavior of RoMON remains largely unchanged, however, the API has changed slightly. The API example provided should be used in version 7 as well.
```mikrotik
/tool romon set enabled=yes
/interface romon add interface=wlan-26
/tool romon set id=router-wlan-26-test
/tool romon set password=your_secure_romon_password
```
Note: There may be slight variations in available features based on the version, and the device's capabilities. It is best practice to always check the relevant RouterOS documentation for the device and version in use.
