Hello, are you having problem adding url list of StevenBlack ?  When I add it to Adlist it doesn't recognize any results and matches. I think it's because the sheet starts with this:If I make my own file and copy only the useful information from its list things work.Because in the video tutorial things work out, but I don't know then if the leaf looked like this .https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/DNSHere is my situation:

I think the problem is you are using this on lower end device that's why the list won't populated try this on RB5009 it should work

I tried it on my ax2 and it worked.Anyway I use NextDNS.

You're right, I tried it on the RB750Gr3, but I also have a HAP AX³ and it worked, got the list without problems. Well, I will use it for DNS. Thank you very much for the help.

This works for smaller devices, as allowances are made  for the limitations.  Also describes how its done.https://itexpertoncall.com/additional_info/moabpre.htmlquote: "MOAB has two tracks, one for MikroTik Routers like the hEX, hAP ax 2, hAP ax 3, the Audience - tracking between 5K and 16K ipset entries - MikroTik Router models like the CHR, RB3011, RB4011, RB5009, RB1100 and all CCR - tracking between 35K and 60K ipset entries. Once we know which MikroTik Router model you have we will decide if your model qualifies and which track to put you on. Both tracks cover over 600 million IP addresses of known perpetrators.For MikroTik Routers like the CHR, RB3011, RB4011, RB5009, RB1100 and all CCR models the maximum download file size is 1 MB or less - 3 times daily.For MikroTik Routers like the hEX, hAP ax 2, hAP ax 3, the Audience - the maximum download file size is 0.5 MB or less - 3 times daily."

You have to set your DHCP server or the hosts themselves manually, the DNS server to be the IP address of the Routerboard on which you use Adlist, then you will start to have reporting. The interesting thing is that for me it gives me 154749 on hAP AX3, and on my virtual machine I installed RouterOS with x86 architecture and there it recognizes them as 17266 entries, and for you it gives them 100908. It's different for everyone, I can't explain it.hAP AX3Virtual RouterOS x86

Lets see:It's not correct because it removes the lines with hash tags even if the hash tag come after correct value.Like this lines.So these lists have to be massaged a little bit before going into the mikrotik device.

@mkx Thx,I am not the best regex script kiddiesBut if Mikrotik device count is false, it's also removes all the lines with hash tags.But i not getting it with this low value 17266. Maybe it's not getting the hole file.

I've never used adlist feature, but I'd expect it to emit some kind of diagnostic messages upon importing the list. At least, say, number of items successfully imported in info channel and any crucial problem in error channel (e.g. if import breaks in the mid of file due to lack of memory or some such). Without it it's impossible to tell why some hosts have lower number of entries than others (and I'd assume that file parser acts the same on all MT platforms so the difference should then be tied to individual device state differences).BTW, I don't expect comments to be the problem, at least config file parser is well able to ignore comments on the code lines.

FIRST increase the DNS cache value a lot. Only then enable it. If you see no matches, 99% it's because of that.

I would like to give an update about this:I have an Hex S, indeed it does not allow big files (5MB) when using an URL.But, for small files it DOES download and functionally works from a local server using the URL.Same file, on GitHub. DOES NOT work.

The problem is poor/stupid programmer or design decision to download adlist files first to device storage instead of memory....  Since the HexS only has 16 MB of storage, and *at best* only a few MB free with ROS 7, you see the problem.I use this script I made, which downloads the target file into*memory*and not the permanent storage:And it works just fine.  That list on my HexS shows:Have fun.Edit:  This also gives added bonus of not needlessly wearing out your flash storage by downloading adlist over and over again to it…

@codelogicThank you!Finally I can also use it with hAP AC2, manually updating the host list every time was a nightmare...I created a scheduler with your script and it works perfectly.

@BillyVanSince we're loading the adlist from a file in memory we've downloaded, ssl-verify has no bearing or effect.@MassiniaThanks for confirming.  I've had it running on my HexS for a couple of weeks without issue as well.Perhaps my post should be marked as real solution here?

### Author: Mon Jul 22, 2024 6:32 pm

SOLUTION, I almost  sprayed my coffee on the screenTryWORK AROUND.A solution is for Mikrotik to recognize this issue and to make a decision.a. Default adlist to Memory (volatile?)b. Default adlist to storgage device (non-volatile?)Assuming your work-around is viablec.  ADD USER SELECTABLE option when executing adlist to choose which  is the preferred method.d.  Something else, that is way smarter than what I came up with in a nano-second.@Normisresponse ???

On my AC2 it works perfectly, just one thing_ to update the file automatically I imagine I have to create a scheduler in ROS to run the script every certain amount of time (2 times a day?)?

@codelogic Thank you very much ;)My hEX S | RB760iGS got swamped with ERROR messages in Log file:[adlist] no space to store a filecache full, not storing [ignoring repeated messages]Shame that mt.lvmanual pages for the DNSdo not provide solution, but rather ONLY give an advise:"Adlist is stored on device's internal memory. Ensure that there is enough free space to save the desired adlist."Also had to manually enter the commands one by one as it always finished with error on ROS 7.16if I paste the whole things into the bash..........# Check cache size and adjust if not large enough# Remove all current adlists# Fetch new adlist source file(s)# Create new adlist from file# Remove temp file from RAM# Check the "DNS" Settings# Check the "AdList"

Hi! Saving lists to USB drive will save space on the router and the resource of the router's storage chip, will allow you to load lists immediately after rebooting the router:If you have a USB in your router and a flash drive, add this script to the scheduler (once a day), you will always have an updated file on the USB drive::If fetch ends with an error, the script does nothing but report an error, the file will be downloaded and reloaded next time. A script is possible with checking the message in the log about the success of the fetch execution, it will be a little more complicated, it is wise to use a universal external log analysis function for this.
