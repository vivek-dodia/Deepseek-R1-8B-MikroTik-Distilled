I think the important point is that it is for "volunteering to approve and disapprove new member posts".Unfortunately, several moderators of the present and past cannot restrict themselves to only performing this task, and they drift away intopolicing others in how to write their articles, and edit articles when they are not to their taste.  Often without mentioning their account name.Hopefully MikroTik presents them with clear rules on what is allowed for moderators, and maintains these.

My comments and many others were simply deleted from the 7.10stable thread and many other threads. Any mention of poor software quality and boom, comment gets deleted.The only reason for me personally to still be here is because network operators can't always afford Juniper or Arista or Nokia. However, I'm working with white box vendors to get things implemented and supported, and eventually we're removing all MikroTik hardware/software, and I'll be exiting this forum for good.

I think the important point is that it is for "volunteering to approve and disapprove new member posts"....Moderation is as tough task as bringing up kids. Kids always find "a gate" in the well known but not written down rules and use it focusing on the particular part convinient for them. You ask to clean a desk so they drop everything on a floor and present clean&tidy desk standing in a pile of crap. No way to discuss as you asked for a clean desk not a clean room. And so on ....Oh, come on, do you think that Normis asked for help just for approving posts just of new memebers and  not for typical everyday moderation?https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is- ... erator.htm

You are right, and as I had already written to you, after going through it too,I understood the pressure both I and other users were giving you, and my apologies to you were due.I think Normis is looking for a moderator, not for 5 minutes a day, but for more time, otherwise the waits continue to be long.With the work I do, I have to be connected all the time, basically from 09:00 (CET) to 22:00 (CET) (if not longer…) 7 days a week.(yes, of course I also have a private life and I'm not in front of the computer all the time)And then I've already done it, so I already know how it all works.

It did not stop. My comments and many others were simply deleted from the 7.10stable thread and many other threads. Any mention of poor software quality and boom, comment gets deleted.When a version is released there is a bold text "Please keep this forum topic strictly related to this particular RouterOS release."If it gets out of hand and becomes spam unrelated to a particular RouterOS release, posts WILL BE DELETED.If you want to discuss RouterOS release strategies or get something else from your chest there are other more appropriate topics, where your posts will not be deleted.

Pointing to a published set of guidelines and rules (which is hard to find on this forum), and alltogether removing posts that are outside the rules, is the limit of their responsibility.  Editing posts to make them to your taste is NOT.

Editing posts to make them to your taste is NOT.Sounds very creepy....Yes, and it is what was going on.Quoted more lines than the moderator liked? They were cut in full - taking out all the context in that post. I understand some people don't like quotes longer than 2 lines, but sometimes one can't help it. And the forum isn't threaded, so we can't use the thread of messages as a guide, to see what some answer is about.Hence, quoting. But that was heavily moderated, much to the detrimental of discussions. I, for one, basically give up on posting - too much hassle.

What the spam is ... let's see ...Spam isunnecessary, unwanted, or repetitive content that clogsinboxes andclutters social media feeds. The term “spam” has been used to refer to junk messages since the earliest days of the Internet.quoted from:https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media ... ions/spam/

### Post 31

I think all reasonable users can agree that spam is things like a post for p3nis enlargement or something else obnoxious and unrelated to the purpose of the form. Spam is not generally considered to be a user using a legitimate feature of the forum to quote or otherwise refer to another user's post. The mod's way of using the forum does not have to be my way or else my post gets edited or deleted.  That is not free and fair conversation. That's censorship and yhe imposition of one's view on the rights of another.  Damn this conversation is so outrageous at this point. LEAVE OUR LEGITIMATE POSTS ALONE!

### Post 32

The reason we get these AI generated reply messages that have to be moderated by a human, is that the board allows unlimited editing of user posts.Those bots (or lowly paid users) that port for the first time and put a ChatGPT-generated blurb (or just copy a message from earlier in the topic) is that they plan to wait for it to be approved, and then they plan to edit it and put their advertisement in there.When the board would simply set the editing to be only allowed for an hour or so (so legitimate posters can correct typos or omissions they notice just after Submit) that mode of operation becomes impossible, and I would expect that this abuse will become less or stop completely.

BartosP, that post is not spam. It is not unrelated to Mikrotik or promoting another product or fake service. Why would it be deleted? It is someone expressing their frustration with the seemingly arbitrary way things are moderated on this forum. A sentiment echoed by a number of us. Just because people don't like it, doesn't make it spam or inappropriate. And I thought the cancel culture was merely a US phenomenon. Think what i think, say it like I want you to, and don't say anything that I might disagree with or else I'll snitch on you and threaten you and make sure you are shut up one way or another. Come on!

If you don't do it my way, I'll keep changing your posts or eventually delete them. And then you wonder why DarkNate is as angry as he is?

@mrz and Mikrotik staff - you all really have to start to have a more active role in ending the overzealous mod issue. This is your brand name and reputation. It's a Mikrotik owned forum. There are people literally abandoning the forum and your products because of the toxic experience they are subjected to by a very small number of people who go on power trips. I'm thankful for mods who volunteer to help keep the forums safe. But those that try to enforce policies that don't exist or punish people for breaking rules that don't exist have got to have their mod rights removed.

Moderators are getting confused ... delete all off-topic posts from this thread or not?"Freedom of writing" vs. "could you answer strictly to my question"?Deleting implies: You are bad guy who does not let us express our thoughts.Leaving them means: You are bad guy who does not clean topics from unwanted posts.No matter what you do, there are some dissatisfied people.In Poland we say: No matter how you turn around, the ass is always in the back.

In this thread a call for mod volunteers was made. Related to that very action are the responses of those of us that are trying to ensure that Mikrotik wisely chooses mods who don't abuse us in the course of posting to the forum. This is no unrelated. It's entirely on topic. Already demonstrated is a clear misunderstanding of free speech and arbitrary censorship. Use whatever funny, pithy proverbs you want, it doesn't change the fact that a non-insignificant number of us are done with the crap.

I think @pe1chl suggestion on edit limits and/or potential other BB controls is worth some consideration.  Don't know what's possible, but more automation is generally a good thing & forces a rules-based approach.FWIW, while I actually like when mods truncate way-longer-than-necessary quotes ... it does seem like the consensus is moderators should not do this....But, as a whole, I don't have significant complaints about how moderation has been handled in my time here.

IMO, the quotation "issue" should be addressed using a BBEdit plugin rather than relying on the arbitrary judgment and preference of a moderator.

---
### Post 59
Author: Unknown

FWIW, while I actually like when mods truncate way-longer-than-necessary quotes ... it does seem like the consensus is moderators should not do this....The problem is when someone truncated a necessarily long quote. Save from reading it entirely - and understanding the context - it's really hit and miss.There is (was?) a rule for quoting,  when I used newsgroups: If the original message is more than 4 lines long, then the full answer post should have more than 50% text. in other words: if you want to quote more than 4 lines of the previous post, be sure to write one new line for each quoted.If the original post is 4 lines or less, editing the quote is appreciated, but not enforced. After all, with 4 lines we may (MAY, not must) very well need to reference all of it.It's a simple rule, and quite effective. I had even one perl filter on my news server, that only allowed long quotes if new content was 50% or more of the message.Now, to get a nice and long flame war going we need to discuss the merits of threaded posts and top posting. This will put any VI/EMACS discussion to shame.

No matter what you do, there are some dissatisfied people.In Poland we say: No matter how you turn around, the ass is always in the back.That's funny that I thought it meant "you never see you own faults", or something like "it's hard to see the dirt on your own face".  But you are correct, according to this Quora threadhttps://www.quora.com/Do-you-know-cool- ... sh-sayingsone of the posts had this:“Jak się nie obrócisz - dupa zawsze z tyłu” (whatever way you turn, your ass is always behind you) used when you faced a problem and all the solutions seem to lead to the same unfortunate outcome.

[...]3. not teach people how to quote or how to write[...]If this forum had any decent rules and guidelines for users and moderators to follow (like any forum of this size should have), preventing abuse of certain annoying behavior from users, and preventing moderators from getting reports of "abuse of power", maybe you'll have more well behaved users (knowing that it's a rule they agree to obey if they want to continue to be a member of the forum, and not just something that one or two moderators think it's right) and maybe more moderators will be willing to .. moderate, knowing what they need to look out for, what they need to punish and what they don't.Regarding the "to quote or not to quote", every decent forum has some saying in this, but they all tend to agree on one thing, I'll post some examples:When replying to a post, do not quote more from the previous post than you have to.orIf quoting a previous post in your response, please try to use only the necessary part of the original quote that reflects what you’re saying.We’re all human and therefore all have relatively short attention spans – usually too short to read through a huge chunk of quoted text. Posts are much easier to respond to when quotes within them are short and specific, doing so helps keeps discussion within each thread fluid.orNow, there are a couple of important points here. Generally, you don't want to leave the entire contents of someone's post inside yours. Usually, it is only some of the text you are commenting on, so, the right thing to do is to trim out of the quote area any text you don't care about, leaving just the text you are going to discuss in your post.or1) If it is the post directly above yours, don’t quote it2) If the quote contains images - remove them first3) If the post you are quoting is very long and you are only answering one part of it please edit the quote so that only the part you are responding to is relevant.or— Don't quote a post if you are the next person replying on the topic to the post immediately preceding. I.e. don't quote the post directly over yours. It is completely pointless and causes unnecessary clutter and reduces readability/information assimilation speed.— Don't quote an entire post. When quoting a post from another member, don't quote the entire post, especially a long one, unless it is absolutely necessary to make your point. Please edit out whatever is not needed.— Quote only if you reply to a specific point mentioned in a post which is not the last post in a topic. And in that case, limit your quote to the exact point you are commenting on...and others.But you can see the big picture common in all of them.Some of those were written over two decades ago, when "Netiquette" was a thing, sadly lost in the last years.Here we have a little wild wild west sadly, no rules, no guidelines, just old grumpy angry users when they get punished in a way or another just because there's no rule telling them that what they're doing is bad/annoying for the majority of users.

If this forum had any decent rules and guidelines for users and moderators to follow[…]Here we have a little wild wild west sadly, no rules, no guidelines, just old grumpy angry users when they get punished in a way or another just because there's no rule telling them that what they're doing is bad/annoying for the majority of users.@ZnevnaThe problem is that some administrators of the forum, rather than having troubles or investigating what the problems are,prefer to indulge the usual 4 users who complain about the moderators, rather than making all the other 1000 forum users happy.(And I was optimistic, since of the 75188 registered users, 50% or more don't even have a post, or at most have one, or are spam accounts...)Or maybe they prefer to listen to two random users onReddit, without even warning you or giving you a chance to rebut…And maybe you find out by chance 8 months later...Not, sorry, 75189, just registered "Math of Christ"memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=219165Is time to delete the ~6500 users without posts, and select from the ~24500 with only one post, all unreplied, what really needs to be kept.

Some of those were written over two decades ago, when "Netiquette" was a thing, sadly lost in the last years.Here we have a little wild wild west sadly, no rules, no guidelines, just old grumpy angry users when they get punished in a way or another just because there's no rule telling them that what they're doing is bad/annoying for the majority of users.Well, speaking of grumpy old men...

[...]Is time to delete the ~6500 users without posts [...]I was a member in a forum for over 5 years before I've made my first post in there.You have to be registered in forums if you want to see attachments.So having no posts is not something you should delete users on.Actually you should never delete users, just anonymize them and their posts.

— Don't quote a post if you are the next person replying on the topic to the post immediately preceding. I.e. don't quote the post directly over yours. It is completely pointless and causes unnecessary clutter and reduces readability/information assimilation speed.The problem with that is that you cannot know if your post will be immediately below the one you are replying to, especially in active topics like a release topic of a recent release.And after you have posted a reply without any quote, you cannot easily insert the quote anymore.So at best you can quote and reply, and then later edit the post to remove the quote once it is obvious that you are immediately below it.

I didn't screenshot the whole page and I don't remember what's under your edit box, but if all the replies are still under your edit box, it's pretty easy to hit the quote button on the post you want to quote, which just inserts it at the cursor position.If not, you can always ctrl+c, close, quote, ctrl+v, submit.It's not that hard, and this argument of yours shouldn't be the one stopping us from having some rules in this forum.I'll look closer when I get the next Post Review notification.I sometimes even just use @user to mark that this is a reply to the last post of that user, instead of using the quote function.

…Posts are starting to disappear for no reason....Now let's see if they start accusing me on Reddit without even telling me, this time they can't blame me, let's see if Reddit users convince you on someone else....viewtopic.php?t=197438#p1010594viewtopic.php?p=1011219#p1010605I have noticed this too. My opinion is that it is more likely to be a MikroTik employee than a new moderator, but I have absolutely no basis for that opinion other than that it isn't a new problem, and we know it was not @rextended.  In the previous case, my reading of what @rextended had written was that he was able to see the reason that was given as the reason for the post being deleted, and not that he deleted the post himself.And when these post get deleted, they are just gone, and any post you have made to the topic is also removed from your posting history.  Without making copies of every post you make, there is no easy way to even know what the topic was.The thread I am thinking about had a question about how to configure a MikroTik switch (CRS326 if my memory is correct) to work in an existing network. There was a diagram posted with it that showed the MikroTik switch, 6 UniFi access points, and what appeared to be a Synology NAS device.  It didn't look like spam to me, at least I wouldn't have considered it spam.  But I didn't look for hidden links, perhaps that was the reason.If posts are not allowed to even mention a competitors product, how are new customers supposed to be able to introduce MikroTik into their existing environment?I don't know if the creator of a topic has the ability to delete the topic, and take with it all replies.  That's a possibility, as that happens on the Ubiquiti forum, and when it happens there, it highly irritates the people that have responded, because then no one else can benefit and learn from the thread.It does not encourage anyone to post if what they post is just going to be deleted.  Because some posts are longer than a twitter post, and take time to compose.  As discussed in this threadWhy was my forum topic deleted?So this is a question:  What are the reasons for deleting posts, and threads?  And when they are deleted, are they just silently removed without any explanation?Wouldn't a better method be to edit the offending parts (with note), and lock the thread?  Then at least it there was useful info it could remain.

both post you are referring are from newly created accounts, a factor that you are not taking into accountThat's correct, I did not take that into consideration.  And I also did not do a google image search to see if the diagram was lifted from somewhere else to give credibility to the post.  But this is going to be a harder and harder job, as AI generated posts and diagrams become more and more convincing.I know nothing about the management/moderation of phpBB and what controls can be put in place to control the first time posters that post a seemingly sincere question, get it approved, and then come back later to add a spam link.  It does seem that @rextended found a reasonably good (I assume mostly automated) way to detect the hidden links with his SpamGPT method.I think someone suggested not allowing new users to edit posts, at least without the change being approved.  But allowing a tentative edit to be made but for it to not be visible (at least to others, and web spiders) would require that phpBB have a relatively complex posting engine (perhaps it does, I really know nothing about how it works other that as a black box).  And having to approve every edit and post would be moderator labor intensive, as well as introducing more latency.  But it seems like even an AI agent could be trained to recognize most type of spam links.  But it will continue to be a cat and mouse arms race.Being a moderator is mostly a thankless job, and I appreciate the volunteers that offered there services to keep the forums as spam free as possible.  I just don't like to see the baby get thrown out with the bath water (if it wasn't clear, the response posts being deleted with the offending topic).

Just $0.02 to show what mix of posts had to be moderated and we (moderators) have to decide what is a true post, what is a spam and what is a background for later abuse.If you see very valid and politically correct post "Thank you for sharing this info" then there is always a moment of frustration "do I delete very polite post" or "Is gonna this person to tweak later?" ... tough decision ... complaints that you moderate "too much" always hurt. Especially if users could avoid some unnecessary things themselves to help keep forum clean, tidy, readable and usable.

My advice regarding "Code of Conduct" is to keep it short and concise with a maximum of three important guidelines. Additionally, include a welcome message that incorporates these guidelines for new members. For example:1. Make this a welcoming forum by addressing each other with respect and hospitality, especially towards new members.2. How to ask a question effectively (including details, exporting, formatting, etc.).3. How to answer a question effectively (including quoting, providing relevant examples, etc.).Detailed examples should be provided in a separate thread with a link to it.

Some guidelines from 1995 for mailing lists are hardly "standards" for forum use, but sure, it's a starting point.The behavior of individual humans hasn't changed noticeably since 1995. It is true, however, that the aggregate behavior permitted by throwing all 8 billion online at oncehaschanged, which may require fresh consideration.Besides, if we're going to get rid of everything documented in RFCs from 1995 and before, RouterOS downloads are going to get a lot smaller.

If it's the first post you must first be approved, otherwise no one sees them.The problem is that moderators often get screwed.They don't even check what's secretly written in the post, and they often approve ridiculous posts,watch the case of those who register just to write "cool!" and then after a few weeks change the message to a spam one.For example, try toreply with quotethis message...and you find ahttps://hidden.message.inside...

It also has happened several times to me that a new member posted a copy of a reply I wrote further above in the topic.  Just a 100% copy.They get approved as it seems a reasonable on-topic reply to the message, then they later change it to a spam.One countermeasure is to turn off editing of messages after some time has elapsed (like an hour or so).You can still edit your message when you see that typo or omission after hitting Submit, but you cannot abuse the forum by editing approved messages.(it also prevents other problems in running discussions)

An example is @anav's "how to" posts, and @pcunites vlan topic.  it is nice for long time users to be able to edit the posts.If it is easy to limit users that are new or have few posts, that is a good idea to disallow editing, because these are the ones that are most likely to bepotential spammers in noob's clothing.

Don't stress the forum users with rules, you'll get a ban or at least a ban warning.But since there's no rule to prohibit editing posts and adding spam links, how should the bots know that it's not allowed?

viewtopic.php?p=1018049#p1017933...More moderators to moderate what?They keep allowing topics like "no internet", "help me", "question". Seriously?Most of the posts are garbage and spam, and by spam I mean opening other topics to post the same thing for the umpteenth time.Moderators should delete those bulls–t, and direct people to ask in the right section and for topics that have the same problem.For example, there are dozens of posts on DDNS of various kinds, which do the same thing, one gets lost even in the search, and I believe they open up new sections.For me at this point the whole forum should be locked, moving it to a subsection and reopening the relevant and more detailed sections from the beginning,for example scripting, api, vlan, ipsec, certificates, wireguard, BGP, lte, lora, etc.all more detailed subsections, instead of generic things,and a beta/rc section all for it's own.Even the discourse of quotations, hundreds of useless posts are produced in the search,because the search also searches in the quoted text, making a mess that disorients.The problem is that if you remove post there is no place to direct poster to a better topic as there should be the new moderation started topic about removed old one and the "better" already existing one. Pointing to any post with gathered so called "good rules of thumb how to write posts" makes no sense as almost none follow them.On the other hand there are a lot of complains on interfering with posts as moderators are not expected  to "know better" than OPs. On the other hand non interfering with posts is assumed to be laziness or ignorance in the moderating "sport".No way to satisfy all.

### Post 184

OpenWRT is software.   MikroTik sells hardware, and includes software with it (RouterOS).I do not see that as competiting product.  It is good to point to OpenWRT when comparing features and developments, but nobody would select OpenWRT where they would otherwise select RouterOS.  They are completely different things.

---
### Post 185

Like @holvoetn wrote inthatthread: there's a thin line when discussing other products in MT's forums between OK and not-OK. Just because OpenWRT runs on MT's hardware it doesn't make it non-competing. When I last checked, MT was selling SW licenses as well. Another thin line is when discussion about 3rd party software (which runs on 2nd party's hardware) is steered towards mocking 2nd party for not providing the same functionality or service level.

---
### Post 186

Openwrt is a free OS, which you may install on many devices produced by many vendors. No one earns money selling it, so it can´t compete with ROS.https://openwrt.org/licenseAlso it´s target userbase is quite different from the ROS users.Apart from all that: I don´t really see any harm for MT in discussing any software running on their hardware on their forums.They have benefited massively from open source while developing ROS.So banning discussions on an alternative open source OS which happens to be marginally useful for their products would not be very ethical or even clever for them.

---
### Post 187

As evidenced, @holvoetn was spot on, "thin line"...  This seem like MT question...A free product is a competitor from business POV.  Now I doubt Mikrotik cares if you're buying hardware and opting out of any support - but IDK.  Since Mikrotik is unlikely to fix OpenWRT "compatibility", most forum convo are going to end with someone getting stuck in trying since there are not open-source drivers or docs, etc., etc. for everything.

This is ridiculous. I have my fair share of problems with Rextended - but suspend an account just because someone posted about a real future device? This is insane. If (IF, and he weren't) he was posting FUD or false information, it would be one thing.But just posting about future devices? No, this is not reason to suspend someone. Anyone.Or were you trolling someone else, @rextended?

### Post 196

If the suspension was due to spoilers, that's clear, but I agree that it's an exaggeration to suspend an account for this, since basically it's only reporting the models of future products, which although they say something, they don't It is not decisive enough to affect the products already on sale today.  I just hope that Rextended doesn't have a problem with a moderator and that this is being used as an excuse to suspend your account.Regards.

It isn't a leak or a breach of DNA: it's just someone reporting what was found on the source.To be honest, I think it is good for Mikrotik - just see how the "leaks" help NVidia, AMD and Intel launches.

In these cases that is difficult to infer from the first question.Almost all questions on this forum initially are vague, do not include any context, and require additional posts to get that info.At that time it may become obvious that the question is not related to any MikroTik software or hardware.I wonder if it would help (and if it is possible in the forum software) to have a form that has to be filled in order to open a topic on the forum.  That is often seen in issue tracking systems.  That form would then ask a lot of questions that would force the user to fill in the relevant information and maybe make him realize he is in the wrong place.

Question and the first answer had no connection to Mikrotik even beeing asked for more details.I don't agree with that!!The first question was clearly from a person with limited knowledge of English, and was about a problem that could be related to his router.Maybe he (or the admin of the router of which he is a user) had attempted to configure some blocking of Youtube or even of another site.We see these come along every couple of weeks.  "I NEED TO BLOCK THIS SITE".We patiently explain them that this is not really possible, and then they find some recipe somewhere else and paste it in.Only after hearing more about that, you can conclude it has nothing to do with a MikroTik router.
