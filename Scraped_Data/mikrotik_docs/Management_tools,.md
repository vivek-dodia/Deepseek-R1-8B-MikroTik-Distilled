After successful RouterOS software installation (if it was needed) it is time to access the router for the first time. There are various ways how to connect to it:
* Command Line Interface (CLI)via Telnet, SSH, serial cable or keyboard and monitor if the router has VGA card.
* Web interface (WebFig)
* WinBox configuration utility
* Using mobile utility (MikroTik mobile app)
Normally you connect to the router by IP addresses with any telnet or SSH client software (a simple text-mode telnet client is usually called telnet and is distributed together with almost any OS).
If no IP or MAC connectivity is available, some devices allow connection through a serial port (DB9 or RJ45, depending on the model);
* Accessing devices over serial console
