**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

```mikrotik
# Interface Configuration
/interface ethernet
set ether-65 disabled=no
/ip address
add address=113.237.159.1/24 interface=ether-65

# Basic Routing Configuration - Direct Connection - NO GATEWAY
/ip route
add dst-address=113.237.159.0/24 gateway=0.0.0.0

# Basic Security - Example allowing established and related connections
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept
add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept
add chain=input in-interface=ether-65 protocol=icmp action=accept
add chain=input action=drop

# DNS Configuration - For testing
/ip dns
set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

**Explanation of Parameters:**

*   `/interface ethernet set ether-65 disabled=no`: Enables the `ether-65` interface.
*   `/ip address add address=113.237.159.1/24 interface=ether-65`: Assigns IP address `113.237.159.1` with a `/24` subnet mask to the `ether-65` interface.
*   `/ip route add dst-address=113.237.159.0/24 gateway=0.0.0.0`: Adds a route for the directly connected subnet `113.237.159.0/24` with no gateway specified.
*   `/ip firewall filter add ...`: Adds firewall rules to allow established/related connections, ICMP on the interface, and drops everything else for basic security.
*  `/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` - Enables DNS requests to the Router from clients and Configures external DNS Servers

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall:** Misconfigured subnet mask. Incorrect subnet masks will result in connectivity issues.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Use `ip address print` to check the configured address and subnet.
        *   Verify the network design to confirm the correct subnet mask.
*   **Pitfall:** Firewall blocking essential traffic. Overly restrictive firewall rules can block important traffic such as ICMP (ping).
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Use `ip firewall filter print` to check current rules.
        *   Temporarily disable the firewall for testing using: `/ip firewall filter disable`
        *   Add specific rules to allow essential traffic.
*   **Pitfall:** Interface not enabled. An interface needs to be explicitly enabled.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Use `/interface ethernet print` to check interface status.
        *   Use `/interface ethernet set ether-65 disabled=no` to enable it.
*   **Error Scenario:** No direct connectivity. You have to ensure that the other end is connected properly.
    *   **Troubleshooting**
        *  Check cables and if possible, test with another device
        *  Use `torch interface=ether-65` to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic
        * Use ping to `113.237.159.1` from a connected device.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping:**
    *   `ping 113.237.159.1` (from the router itself) to verify the IP address configuration on the local router.
    *   `ping 113.237.159.x` (from a device in the 113.237.159.0/24 network) to verify basic network connectivity (replace `x` with a device on the subnet).
*   **Traceroute:**
    *   `traceroute 113.237.159.x` from the router to verify the path to the destination (replace `x` with a destination device IP in the subnet).
*   **Torch:**
    *   `torch interface=ether-65` to capture and analyze traffic on the interface (for more advanced troubleshooting).

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **Address Lists:** Create address lists for easier management of multiple addresses/subnets for firewalls and routing.
*   **Policy-Based Routing:**  Use policy-based routing to route traffic based on source IP or other criteria.
*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** Use VRF to create separate routing tables for different customer segments. This is advanced but useful in an ISP scenario.
*   **OSPF/BGP:** Use dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or BGP for more complex routing environments.

    ```
**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing:** MikroTik uses standard IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.  Assigning an address to an interface allows the router to communicate on that network.
*   **IP Pools:** Pools define a range of IP addresses to be used, often with DHCP. They are not needed for this static configuration but are important for DHCP servers.
*   **IP Routing:** Determines how network packets are forwarded between networks. MikroTik uses a routing table to make forwarding decisions. Routes can be static or dynamic (learned via protocols). The directly connected routes are always automatically created, but in complex networks, you must ensure they have priority over other routes.
*   **IP Settings:** Global settings for IP networking, including TCP/IP parameters, routing, etc.
*   **MAC Server:** For MAC-based filtering, is not really needed for this config.
*   **RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network):**  A MikroTik proprietary tool for centralized management across multiple routers. Useful for large ISP networks. It is not recommended to enable in all scenarios.
*   **WinBox:** MikroTikâ€™s graphical configuration tool. It provides a user-friendly interface but can sometimes be slow on high latency networks. CLI is usually preferable for speed.
*   **Certificates:** For securing encrypted services, such as HTTPS on the router and VPN services. Essential for security.
*   **PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):** For managing user access for PPP connections such as PPPoE. Used for customer authentication in ISPs.
*   **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):** A centralized AAA server, often used with PPP or hotspot services. Essential for large networks.
*   **User / User Groups:** Allows for different permissions levels on the router configuration. Important for security.
*   **Bridging and Switching:** Combines multiple Ethernet interfaces to act as a single switch. Not directly used in this example but vital for some network designs.
*   **MACVLAN:**  Creates multiple logical interfaces on a single physical interface. It allows you to assign several different MAC addresses to a single hardware interface. Use cases include containerization, and multiple MAC addresses.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:** Offloads some routing to dedicated hardware, increasing performance.  Available on certain RouterBOARD models.
*   **MACsec:**  A security protocol that provides encryption at the data link layer. Not always needed and its use depends on your network security needs.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS):**  Manages bandwidth to ensure priority for critical applications or services. Very important in ISP networks.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Change Default Passwords:** Ensure the default user is disabled and change the admin user password to a strong, unique password
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services that are not being used (e.g., HTTP API if not needed).
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit management access to specific IP addresses. Create a specific user to access only the services needed.
*   **Use Strong Passwords:** Use complex and long passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Always install the latest version for security patches.
*   **Implement Firewalls:** Use both input and forward chains in the firewall to filter traffic.
*  **Disable Default DNS settings:** Default DNS settings should be removed as the Router is not meant to act as a local resolver for all networks.
*  **Do not allow remote winbox access:** This should be restricted to VPNs or a secured network only
*  **Enable logging:** Ensure all logs are configured to store necessary events.

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for Other Topics**

Since the request is very broad, including all the topics requested would make this document excessively large. I will provide a summary and examples for some of the most relevant topics to the ISP and the current configuration. Please, ask for more details on the other topics not covered.

*   **Firewall:** This is absolutely critical for a MikroTik router, especially in ISP environments. The basic example above provides a basic level of security by blocking non established connections to the router. You could modify it to filter traffic more specifically.

    ```mikrotik
    # Example for allowing access from specific subnet
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input src-address=192.168.1.0/24 protocol=tcp dst-port=22 action=accept comment="Allow SSH from trusted network"

    # Example for dropping specific traffic
    add chain=forward src-address=10.0.0.0/24 protocol=udp dst-port=53 action=drop comment="Block DNS from untrusted network"
    ```

*   **Quality of Service (QoS):** Used to prioritize bandwidth for different traffic types. This is more relevant in a congested network or to give priority to customer traffic over other non-essential traffic from the same network.

    ```mikrotik
    # Example for QoS
    /queue type
    add kind=pcq pcq-rate=10M name="customer-upload"
    /queue simple
    add target=113.237.159.0/24 max-limit=10M/10M queue=customer-upload/default
    ```
    In this example a queue called `customer-upload` has been configured with a maximum speed for the `/24` network

*   **IP Services (DHCP, DNS):** MikroTik offers DHCP server, DNS server and caching, SOCKS proxy, and a web proxy. For an ISP, DHCP server and DNS forwarding are vital. For this particular configuration, a DNS forwarding server has been enabled.

    ```mikrotik
    # DHCP Server Example (Not part of the initial config, but here for the sake of completeness)
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool ranges=113.237.159.100-113.237.159.200
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=dhcp_pool disabled=no interface=ether-65 lease-time=1d
    /ip dhcp-network
    add address=113.237.159.0/24 dns-server=113.237.159.1 gateway=113.237.159.1
    ```
   Here, a DHCP server is configured, using a local pool and handing out the router as a DNS Server

*   **High Availability Solutions:**  MikroTik supports various high-availability solutions such as VRRP and bonding. VRRP allows one router to take over in case another fails. Bonding combines multiple links into one.

    ```mikrotik
    # VRRP Example (requires two routers)
    # On Router 1:
    /interface vrrp
    add interface=ether-65 priority=200 vrid=1 address=113.237.159.254/24 password=mypass
    # On Router 2:
    /interface vrrp
    add interface=ether-65 priority=100 vrid=1 address=113.237.159.254/24 password=mypass
    ```

*   **Routing Protocols:** MikroTik supports routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP and RIP. For large ISPs BGP is a common requirement for its extensive control of the routing process. These are highly complex topics but essential for large networks.

    ```mikrotik
    # Example of BGP config (this would be a very complex scenario and needs many details)
     /routing bgp instance
     set default as=65001 router-id=1.1.1.1
     /routing bgp peer
     add instance=default remote-address=172.16.0.2 remote-as=65002 update-source=ether-65
    ```

*   **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** MikroTik supports various VPN protocols such as IPsec, L2TP, OpenVPN, and WireGuard. Used to create secure connections to the network.
   ```mikrotik
    # Example of L2TP IPsec server
      /interface l2tp-server server
      set enabled=yes ipsec-secret=sharedsecret
       /ppp profile
        add name=l2tp-profile local-address=10.10.10.1 remote-address=10.10.10.2-10.10.10.254
   ```
   In this example, a l2tp server with ipsec is enabled and a pool is assigned. You must enable the secret, users and adjust your firewall for it to work

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:** Static routes are easier to manage but are less scalable. Dynamic routing is more flexible but requires more configuration and knowledge.
*   **Firewall Complexity:**  A simple firewall is easier to manage, but a more complex firewall offers better security at the cost of configuration and more resources usage.
*   **High Availability Solutions:**  VRRP adds redundancy but requires two routers. Bonding adds throughput but can increase complexity and is dependant on the underlying hardware.
*   **NAT vs. Non-NAT:** NAT adds an extra layer of complexity but avoids address overlap. It adds an extra overhead, it is not necessary to configure if you have an IP address allocated directly to the devices in the network
*   **Security vs. Performance:** Some security features (e.g., deep packet inspection) may impact performance.

**Further Customization and Considerations:**
*   Use `interface list` to organize your interfaces to make configuration easier, this is especially useful if you have many interfaces
*   Always check the logs for errors or misconfigurations. Use `/system logging print` and `/log print`
*   Use `netwatch` for monitoring remote addresses and get notified of connectivity loss or changes. `/tool netwatch add host=8.8.8.8 comment="test google" up-script="/log info message=\"google is up\""`
