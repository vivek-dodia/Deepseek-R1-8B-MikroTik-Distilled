[@dude2k: check out the WiFi logs and help others by analyze the root cause. Btw, what build are you using? Fwiw, I’m still running macOS 15 RC on an M2 MBA with no issues (so far anyway!) using AX with FT.Hi, I'm using 7.15.3 on all Mikrotik APs and Routers. Before iOS18 I had no  problem, also roaming was working fine.My Wifi Debug Logs are looking exactly like the logs k2dI5umrD9VO already posted.I Have AC and AX APs and use FT and "FT over DS". WPA2-PSK and WPA3-PSK (But also tested only WPA2-PSK, but didn't work)Examples:Code:Select all

I encountered the same problem with a MacBook Air M1 after updating it to macOS Sequoia and being unable to connect to my home Wi-Fi. The MacBook was connecting fine on macOS Sonoma.The issue appears to be related to theencryptionparameter in/interface/wifi/security.Code:Select allNow the MacBook connects fine after removing theencryptionparameter from my/interface/wifi/security profileand using the default value.After some more testing, it seems to work fine withencryption=ccmp,gcmpas well.

Latest v7 release.That was a simple question about the ROS version number; the answer to that is not "latest". We don't know what you think "latest" is.My spouse recentlyupdated her iPhone SE to iOS 18. Since then, she can't connect to the Wi-Fi network. Whenever I try to connect, it prompts for the Wi-Fi password, I enter it correctly, but then it immediately says unable to connect.Nothing at the router or Wi-Fi AP level has changed.Yet, you come to the forum, create a topic, and want to place all the blame on ROS. That's a rather strange approach. The device you've updated has a problem after update. Is there a correlation?Sure, ask for help and for ways to solve the problem. Or for sharing your experience. There were also plenty of suggestions to direct the issue to Apple. Yet, Mikrotik gets all of your frustration. The hurdle for an Apple developer account is probably higher than venting your frustration in Mikrotik user forum.No one denies that there is also a problem in ROS. However, the issue specifically occurs after an update of the iOS device. It makes sense to first report to Apple.And because you didn't mention it, many people here believed your issue was was with an AX AP (wifi-qcom driver). That's why there are also responses saying it works perfectly on iOS 18. However, the Audience is an AC device with a wifi-qcom-ac driver. That's a completely different driver and hardware.Code:Select allSome remarks:- no reason to enable FT on mesh link (wifi3). Or are your Audiences moving around?- connect-priority=0/1. I see this in every second config pasted here. Are you all copy pasting from the same topic?- .encryption=ccmp,gcmp,ccmp-256,gcmp-256. Is this something WinBox sets? Or is this on purpose?

I have the same issue with my iPhone 15 Pro Max and MacBook M1 Pro (2021) when connecting to the cAP Ax2 (ROS 7) as well as the hAP Ac2 (ROS 6) with CAPsMAN. Turning on the GCMP cipher resolves the issue with the cAP Ax2 (ROS 7). I’m going to try the same with the hAP Ac2 (ROS 6) CAPsMAN, where I couldn’t connect to my network until I rebooted the MacBook. However, after deep sleep or some time, the issue reappears, and I have to reboot the MacBook again to make it work. Meanwhile, my wife’s iPhone 16 Pro Max has no issues at all, regardless of whether the GCMP cipher is enabled.I also have a similar issue with my BMW X4 CarPlay function. BMW uses Bluetooth and WiFi for streaming audio, and after a fresh iPhone reboot, it works. However, after some time (maybe a few hours), it won’t connect until I reboot my iPhone.It seems like this is an Apple problem, and I can’t resolve it myself in the BMW like I did with the MikroTik. And it’s better described as a workaround rather than a solution.Update: solved in iOS 18.2 beta 2

Who knows - may be it's hardware dependent. But differently the need of rebooting device to connect to some wifi networks is something that I wouldn't expect from the gadget with $1500 price  )For me it's reproducible in 100% cases: connect to WPA3 powered WiFi (MT) leads to no connectivity to any WPA2 network (neither running on MT nor Action camera) unless device is rebooted.IMHO: I don't have anything special about my MT setupCode:Select allAnd I totally agree withLarsa: all those issues should be reported to apple support.
