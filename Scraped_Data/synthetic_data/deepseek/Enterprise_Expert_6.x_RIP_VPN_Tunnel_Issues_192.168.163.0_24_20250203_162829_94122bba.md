# Analysis Process
Okay, I need to create a detailed MikroTik RouterOS troubleshooting scenario for RIP with the given parameters. Let me start by breaking down each section as outlined.

First, the Initial Problem Report and Symptoms. The users are reporting intermittent connectivity over a VPN tunnel, affecting 343 users for 23 hours. The subnet is 10.100.74.48/28, enterprise scale, cloud environment, RouterOS 6.x. Symptoms should include things like packet loss, RIP routes missing, VPN tunnel flapping, high latency. Maybe some logs showing RIP updates failing.

Next, Environment Description and Network Topology. Need to use Mermaid. There's HQ Router and Cloud Router connected via VPN (probably IPsec or some tunnel). Each has RIP enabled. The HQ has LAN subnets, and the Cloud has the 10.100.74.48/28 subnet. Maybe a simple diagram with those elements.

Initial Assessment Steps: Check interface statuses, VPN tunnel status, RIP neighbors, routing tables. Use commands like /interface print, /ip route print, /routing rip neighbor print. Also check logs with /log print.

Detailed Debugging Process: Start with checking VPN tunnel. Use /interface gre print or /ip ipsec active-peers print. Maybe the tunnel is up but there's MTU issues. Then check RIP configuration. Verify that RIP is enabled on the correct interfaces. Look at the RIP database with /routing rip database print. Maybe there are no routes being received. Check if the network statements include the correct subnets. Use /routing rip interface print. Maybe the Cloud subnet isn't advertised correctly. Then check for firewall rules that might block RIP multicast (UDP 520). Use /ip firewall filter print. Maybe a rule is blocking the protocol. Check if the VPN tunnel is using an MTU that's too low, causing fragmentation and dropped RIP packets. Maybe adjust the MTU or enable clamp-tcp-mss.

Key Findings: Root cause could be that the firewall is blocking RIP traffic over the VPN tunnel, or MTU issues causing packet loss. Maybe the RIP network configuration on the Cloud Router doesn't include the tunnel interface, so routes aren't exchanged.

Solution Implementation: Add firewall rules to allow RIP (UDP 520) on the tunnel interface. Adjust MTU settings on the tunnel and enable clamp-tcp-mss. Update RIP configuration to include the tunnel interface on both routers. Example commands would be adding the firewall accept rule, setting MTU, and adding the RIP interface.

Verification: Check RIP neighbors again, confirm routes in the routing table. Test connectivity with ping and traceroute. Check logs for RIP updates.

Prevention Measures: Regular audits of firewall rules, monitoring RIP neighbors, MTU considerations in tunnel setups, documentation.

Related Commands: All the ones used in the steps. Common pitfalls: Forgetting to allow RIP in firewall, incorrect network statements in RIP, MTU mismatches, not verifying both ends of the VPN.

I need to make sure CLI examples are in code blocks, with comments. Also include before and after configs where relevant, like firewall rules or RIP interfaces. Maybe show a log snippet where RIP packets are blocked before and allowed after.

Wait, in RouterOS 6.x, the RIP configuration might be under /routing rip, and interfaces are added there. Also, firewall rules might have been recently changed, so maybe a recent update introduced a block on UDP 520.

Another thought: RIP uses multicast; maybe the VPN tunnel isn't forwarding multicast traffic properly. But IPsec tunnels in transport mode might not support multicast unless properly configured. So maybe the tunnel was set up in a way that doesn't allow multicast, hence RIP updates aren't traversing.

Alternatively, the tunnel might be using a protocol that doesn't support multicast, like a point-to-point GRE without multicast enabled. So checking the tunnel configuration for multicast support.

Also, RIP version compatibility between the two routers. If one is using RIPv1 and the other RIPv2, that could cause issues. Check the RIP version settings.

Hmm. The user specified RouterOS 6.x, so I need to ensure the commands are compatible with that version. For example, in 6.x, the RIP configuration is under /routing rip, and the commands might differ slightly from newer versions.

So putting it all together, the root cause is likely a combination of firewall rules blocking RIP and MTU issues. The solution involves adjusting the firewall, MTU, and RIP interface settings.

# MikroTik RouterOS Troubleshooting Scenario: RIP VPN Tunnel Issues

## 1. Initial Problem Report and Symptoms
**Report**: 343 users in subnet `10.100.74.48/28` experience intermittent connectivity via a cloud-hosted VPN tunnel.  
**Symptoms**:
- Intermittent packet loss (30-40%) across the VPN tunnel.
- RIP routes missing from routing tables after 15-20 minutes.
- VPN tunnel stability issues (flapping).
- High latency (>500ms) during outages.
- Logs show RIP update timeouts and authentication failures.

## 3. Initial Assessment Steps
1. **Verify VPN Tunnel Status**:
   ```bash
   /interface gre print
   /ip ipsec active-peers print
   ```
2. **Check RIP Neighbors**:
   ```bash
   /routing rip neighbor print
   ```
3. **Review Routing Table**:
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=rip
   ```
4. **Check Firewall Rules**:
   ```bash
   /ip firewall filter print where comment~"RIP|VPN"
   ```
5. **Log Analysis**:
   ```bash
   /log print where message~"RIP|IPsec"
   ```

---

## 4. Detailed Debugging Process
### Step 1: Confirm VPN Tunnel Stability
```bash
[admin@HQ] > /interface monitor-traffic gre-tunnel1
  received: 12.3Mbps  transmitted: 14.7Mbps  # Traffic spikes correlate with RIP updates

[admin@Cloud] > /ip ipsec policy print
  ph2-count: 23  # High rekeying suggests instability
```

### Step 2: Validate RIP Configuration
```bash
[admin@HQ] > /routing rip interface print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive
 #   INTERFACE        VERSION  AUTHENTICATION
 0   gre-tunnel1      v2       none
 1   ether1           v2       none

[admin@Cloud] > /routing rip network print
 # NETWORK
 0 10.100.74.48/28    # Missing gre-tunnel1 interface
```

### Step 3: Check for Fragmentation Issues
```bash
[admin@HQ] > /ping 10.100.74.50 size=1500 do-not-fragment
HOST                                    SIZE  TTL TIME  STATUS
10.100.74.50                            1500  57  120ms packet needs to be fragmented but DF set
```

### Step 4: Analyze Firewall Rules
```bash
[admin@Cloud] > /ip firewall filter print where dst-port=520
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
 0   chain=input action=drop protocol=udp dst-port=520 # Blocking RIP updates!
```

---

## 5. Key Findings and Root Cause Analysis
**Root Cause**:  
1. Firewall rule on the cloud router dropping UDP/520 (RIP) traffic.
2. GRE tunnel MTU mismatch causing RIP update fragmentation.
3. RIP not configured on the cloud router's tunnel interface.

**Impact**:  
RIP routes failed to propagate, causing asymmetric routing and tunnel flapping.

---

## 6. Solution Implementation Steps
1. **Allow RIP Traffic**:
   ```bash
   /ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=udp dst-port=520 action=accept comment="Allow RIP"
   ```
2. **Adjust MTU**:
   ```bash
   /interface gre set gre-tunnel1 mtu=1400
   /ip ipsec policy set 0 tcp-mss=1350
   ```
3. **Update RIP Configuration**:
   ```bash
   /routing rip network add network=10.100.74.48/28
   /routing rip interface add interface=gre-tunnel1
   ```

---

## 7. Verification Process
1. Confirm RIP neighbors:
   ```bash
   [admin@HQ] > /routing rip neighbor print
    0  interface=gre-tunnel1 address=10.100.74.50 uptime=1h2m
   ```
2. Check routes:
   ```bash
   [admin@HQ] > /ip route print where protocol=rip
   Dst Address       Gateway         Distance
   10.100.74.48/28   10.100.74.50    2       # Route restored
   ```
3. Test connectivity:
   ```bash
   [admin@HQ] > /ping 10.100.74.50 count=100
     sent=100 received=98 packet-loss=2% 
   ```

---

## 8. Prevention Measures
1. Implement firewall rule auditing quarterly.
2. Enable RIP MD5 authentication:
   ```bash
   /routing rip interface set gre-tunnel1 authentication=md5 authentication-key=secret
   ```
3. Monitor MTU with automated alerts:
   ```bash
   /tool snmp set enabled=yes
   ```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/routing rip database print` | Show RIP-learned routes |
| `/interface monitor-traffic [interface]` | Real-time traffic analysis |
| `/ip firewall connection print` | Check active VPN sessions |

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Mismatched RIP versions** between devices.
2. **Overlooking MTU** in tunneled environments.
3. **Forgetting to advertise loopback interfaces** in RIP.
4. **Hardcoding routes** instead of relying on dynamic protocols.
