**IP Pools**

**1. Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

- Configure multiple IP pools with different ranges and subnet masks
- Assign IP addresses from the pools to DHCP clients

**2. Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. Create IP Pools:
```
/ip pool add name=pool1 ranges=10.10.10.1-10.10.10.254
/ip pool add name=pool2 ranges=192.168.10.1-192.168.10.254
```

2. Configure DHCP Server:
```
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=pool1 interface=ether1 lease-time=86400s
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=pool2 interface=ether2 lease-time=86400s
```

**3. Complete Configuration Commands**

- IP Pool Creation:
```
/ip pool add name=<pool-name> ranges=<ip-range>
```
- DHCP Server Configuration:
```
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=<pool-name> interface=<interface> lease-time=<seconds>
```

**4. Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

- Overlapping IP ranges: Ensure the IP ranges for different pools do not overlap.
- Incorrect subnet masks: Verify that the subnet masks for each pool are correct.
- DHCP server not started: Ensure the DHCP server is enabled and running.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

- Use Winbox or Terminal to check the IP pool configurations:
```
/ip pool print
/ip dhcp-server print
```

- Test DHCP connectivity by connecting a client device to each interface and verifying the IP address assigned.

**6. Related Features and Considerations**

- **IP Address Allocation:** RouterOS offers various options for IP address allocation, including IP pools, DHCP, and static assignments.
- **Load Balancing:** IP pools can be used for load balancing by assigning different pools to different DHCP servers.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

- **Create an IP Pool:**
```
POST /ip/pool
{
  "name": "pool1",
  "ranges": "10.10.10.1-10.10.10.254"
}
```

- **Add an Address Pool to a DHCP Server:**
```
POST /ip/dhcp-server/add-address-pool
{
  "address-pool": "pool1",
  "interface": "ether1",
  "lease-time": 86400
}
```
