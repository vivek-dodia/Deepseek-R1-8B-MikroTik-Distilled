## Initial Question
TLS 1.3 has been around for quite some time now. Why does RouterOS still not support it? ---

## Response 1
Because there is no urge for Mikrotik to support it. As long TLS 1.2 is not deprecated/discouraged as 1.0/1.1 - Mikrotik won't move. ---

## Response 2
Even my brother printer I just bought has tls 1.3 LOL. What a farce. ---

## Response 3

I’d think they would want to ensure RouterOS supports the current security standards at a minimum.My Ubiquiti EdgeRouters, which haven’t gotten a real software release in 4+ years, support TLS 1.3. ---

## Response 4
We don't know. ---

## Response 5
When a company fails to communicate properly, it is left to others to speculate.This is where MTs marketing and communications director is a complete failure.my guess --> LazyWhat i hope its not --> lack the technical competence to code it in. ---

## Response 6
if they dont use any of the common libraries like openssl, then it is maybe quite an effort for Mikrotik. They have to set priorities. Not laziness. We know ROS lacks many features and I guess support for TLS 1.3 is not crucial - now. ---

## Response 7
Yes, bit of tongue in cheek there, but concur, lack of resourcesto ensure the router is up to date.This is not like wifi7 which entails buying new hardware and adapting etc......... and also waiting for optimal pricing, new kid off the block has highest initial costs until they are mass produced. ---

## Response 8
As long as TLS 1.2 is still considered secure and ROS supports secure ciphers, I couldn't care less. Everything else is compliance BS. ---

## Response 9
From my reading, tls 1.3 is a no-brainer. ---

## Response 10
As long as TLS 1.2 is still considered secure and ROS supports secure ciphers, I couldn't care less. Everything else is compliance BS.It's is not just about security, TLS 1.3 have more optimal handshake, less round trips. ---

Everything else is compliance BS.It's is not just about security, TLS 1.3 have more optimal handshake, less round trips.True. But when it comes to managing your router/switch/AP, how many hundreds of connection inits per second do your devices get hit with?The feature you're mentioning may matter for large web servers with thousands connections per second, not for average MT router with a few connections a day. ---
