I'm investigating routing performance on CHR, I have the P10 license. Running the bandwidth test to 127.0.0.1 to measure the internal performance I seem to be getting around 10 Gbit. Is this the P10 license preventing higher speeds?In other words; do I need to upgrade to an unlimited license to see the "true potential" of my CHR setup?

Perhaps read the docs before asking?https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... enseLevelsP10 (perpetual-10) license level allows CHR to run indefinitely.It is limited to 10Gbps upload per interface

Hello. I have, both when purchasing the license, and when looking into this. I am well aware of the limitations of the P10 license.The reason I'm asking is that I've read some forum posts indicating that people were getting higher results doing the bandwidth test internally, than their license allowed. Just wanted to verify this before upgrading my license.

make a new VM, request a free trial for the P-unlimited license, test it. Trial is free and you can check any limits

That is a good idea, I'll do that. Thanks
