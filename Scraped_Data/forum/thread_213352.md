Hi,Am running Capsman V2 on HEX Refresh (E50UG) running 7.16.2 with CAP AC also running 7.16.2 and wireless package removed, qcom-ac package added, placed in CAPS mode.I have performed all config in Winbox 3.41.I have a main config that has the Configuration, Security, Steering tabs with settings and the Channel tab empty.I then have a 2G settings config with the Channel tab setup for the 2GHz N band with 1,6,11 frequencies and 20 Mhz width. This is per Tom's "Capsman Evolved" Youtube video. I have also tried disabling Secondary Frequency. All other tabs are empty - aside from the Configuration Name.I also have a 5G settings config which is similar in having 5GHz ac band with ch36/5180MHz - ch52/5260MHz - ch100/5500MHz - ch132/5660MHz specified and allowing 80Mhz width.My AP setting the 2.4Ghz radio to 40Mhz, but the 5GHz is set to 80Mhz (what is limit ? GUI shows 160).On my phone I can see 802.11k and 802.11v but no 802.11r, despite having steering configured. Not sure if that is my phone/software.

What's the idea behind "subsettings" part of config ?To apply it to Jasmine Home ? Doesn't work that way.You apply through provisioning a master config (and if needed slave config) to a radio.All info for that config needs to be in that master config (either directly, either via sub-section which is then referenced to from master config).And that's why you see 40MHz as channel width.That 2G Subsettings part is nowhere used for Jasmine Home.You also have 2 additional provisioning rules with only those 2G and 5G subsettings, but since a blanket rule is already applied for Jasmine Home before, they do not get used anymore.About 160MHz channel width, that's for APs capable of using it. First one which can is wAP AX (and it works just fine).You can leave it unselected for 5G, it will figure it out on its own what can be used.How it should be corrected:- make 2 channel settings, one for 2G and one for 5G- reference those channel settings in the master config (so you will need 2 master configs and 2 provisioning rules, one for each band)- no separate provisioning of the 2 subsettings (doesn't get applied anyhow)

802.11r is fast transition (FT) and it's missing because you didn't configure it.

I did a bit of rewriting, assuming that your CAPsMAN is the HEX Refresh and you have multiple CAP's:I used the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle and removed all settings that are handled by default (i.e. steering).Hope this helps you, I didn't test it so there might be some typos.

I am genuinely appreciative of the quality and comprehensiveness of the responses. Thank you to all of you !Normally when I put all the detail into a forum - or even support request - I find I either get no response or people obviously do not read it and ask me questions already covered.Your responses covered everything and provided me options - absolutely brilliant !Thank you Holvoetn - yes I was trying to "layer" the configurations since it was explained the sections were separate. Seems annoying to have to maintain two, but I have split out what I can (e.g. channels) so at least it is just a drop down box selection in each one. Extra points for "how it should be corrected" section.Thank you Neki - I have enable Fast Transition in Winbox with the defaults and 802.11r now shows up. Too many acronyms issue (Fault Tolerance) made me ignore it !Thank you Erlinden - I have removed the Steering configuration in Winbox. If it is enable by default then I will leave it blank.Once again, thank you all. It looks good now. I have to check with owner if I need to brave setting up separate Guest network yet, but that is a separate issue !Will check back to see if I can mark as solved.CheersIan

About 160MHz channel width, that's for APs capable of using it. First one which can is wAP AX (and it works just fine).Actually ... audience was first:
