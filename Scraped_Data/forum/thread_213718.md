SOLVED, I found a way around:before downgrading from 7.13 to a pre-7.12 version, you have to remove the wireless package using the following command:/system/package/uninstall wirelessthen, you have to reboot, and only after this step you can upload the ros .npk files and perform the downgrade using the following command:/system/package/downgrade
