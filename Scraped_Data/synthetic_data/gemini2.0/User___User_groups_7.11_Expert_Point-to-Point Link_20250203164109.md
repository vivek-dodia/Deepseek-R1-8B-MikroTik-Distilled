Okay, let's dive deep into managing users and user groups on MikroTik RouterOS (versions 7.11, 6.48 and 7.x), specifically in the context of a point-to-point link using a bridge interface on the 84.24.96.0/24 subnet. We'll focus on practical, expert-level configuration with security best practices in mind.

## Scenario Description:

This configuration aims to set up a MikroTik router acting as a central point in a Point-to-Point network within the 84.24.96.0/24 subnet. We'll use a bridge interface named "bridge-64" to facilitate this. We will configure users and user groups in order to control access to this router and network. This is essential to be able to manage and secure a router within a network and control admin access. This approach is suitable for SOHO, SMB, and even certain enterprise networks. We'll avoid complex features like user-manager radius.

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Step 1: Setting Up the Bridge Interface

*   **Purpose:** Creates a bridge interface to allow multiple interfaces to act as one. This is the basis for our network to operate in our scenario.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge
    add name=bridge-64 protocol-mode=none
    ```

    *   `add name=bridge-64`: Creates a new bridge interface named "bridge-64".
    *   `protocol-mode=none`: Disables Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) as it's generally not needed in simple point-to-point setups.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `Bridge` > `Bridge` Tab.
    *   Click the "+" button, enter `bridge-64` in the `Name` field, and click `Apply` and `OK`.
    *   Make sure the protocol mode is set to `none`.
*   **Before Configuration State:** No bridge called bridge-64 present in `/interface bridge print` output.
*   **After Configuration State:** The new interface `bridge-64` will be present and enabled in `/interface bridge print` output.
*   **Effect:** The bridge interface is created. It will need interfaces added to it in order to carry traffic.
    **Important Note:** If you already have a bridge called `bridge-64`, modify the name or delete the existing bridge before running this command.

### 2. Step 2: Adding the Interface to the Bridge

*   **Purpose:**  Adds Ethernet interfaces to the newly created bridge. This could be the port facing the LAN or other connecting routers. For this example, we will add `ether1`.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=bridge-64 interface=ether1
    ```

    *   `bridge=bridge-64`: Specifies the bridge the interface will be added to.
    *   `interface=ether1`: The interface to be added to the bridge. Change this value to reflect the interface you want to add.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `Bridge` > `Ports` Tab.
    *   Click the "+" button, select `bridge-64` in `Bridge` dropdown, choose `ether1` (or interface you want to bridge) in the `Interface` dropdown, then click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Before Configuration State:** Ether1 is a standalone interface.
*   **After Configuration State:**  Ether1 is a port of bridge-64. It will no longer be individually accessible.
*   **Effect:** Ether1 will become part of the bridge and bridge-64 will be the point to manage all interfaces attached.
    **Important Note:** You need to ensure that no configuration such as IP addressing is applied to ether1 directly.

### 3. Step 3: Assigning an IP Address to the Bridge

*   **Purpose:**  Assigns an IP address to the bridge for network communication on the subnet.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=84.24.96.1/24 interface=bridge-64
    ```

    *   `address=84.24.96.1/24`: The IP address and subnet mask. You can use any available address within your subnet.
    *   `interface=bridge-64`: The bridge interface where this address will be assigned.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `IP` > `Addresses`.
    *   Click the "+" button. Enter `84.24.96.1/24` in the `Address` field. Select `bridge-64` in the `Interface` dropdown. Click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Before Configuration State:** No IP addressing on bridge-64.
*   **After Configuration State:** bridge-64 has the configured IP Address.
*   **Effect:** The bridge now has an IP address and can communicate on the 84.24.96.0/24 subnet.

### 4. Step 4: Creating a User Group

*   **Purpose:**  Creates a user group with specific permissions to limit access.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /user group
    add name=admins policy=read,write,test,password,web,ftp,reboot,policy,winbox,local
    ```

    *   `name=admins`: The name of the user group.
    *   `policy=read,write,test,password,web,ftp,reboot,policy,winbox,local`: Full access permissions. See the user section explanation for more detailed information.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `System` > `Users` > `Groups` Tab.
    *   Click the "+" button, enter `admins` in the `Name` field, and select desired policy permissions. Click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Before Configuration State:** No user groups defined.
*   **After Configuration State:** User group `admins` exists with the defined policies.
*   **Effect:** A new user group named "admins" with full access is created.
    **Important Note:** Consider using a limited permission group for general administrators, and keep "full" for emergency access. Also, be sure to set up a password to the main user "admin".

### 5. Step 5: Creating a User

*   **Purpose:**  Creates a new user and assigns it to the defined group.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /user
    add name=your_username group=admins password=your_password
    ```

    *   `name=your_username`: The username for the new user. Replace "your_username" with your desired username.
    *   `group=admins`: Assigns this user to the 'admins' user group.
    *   `password=your_password`: The password for the new user. Replace "your_password" with a strong, complex password.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `System` > `Users` > `Users` Tab.
    *   Click the "+" button, enter `your_username` in the `Name` field, `your_password` in the password field, choose `admins` from `Group` dropdown. Click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Before Configuration State:** No user exists.
*   **After Configuration State:** The user `your_username` exists with the specified group and password.
*   **Effect:** A new user with administrator rights is created. The user `admin` can still be used (with default or specified password) for initial setup, but is not recommended.

### 6. Step 6: Disabling the Default "admin" User

*   **Purpose:**  Disables the default "admin" user account for improved security.
*   **CLI Example:**

    ```mikrotik
    /user set admin disabled=yes
    ```

    *   `set admin`: Specifies that we are setting the parameters for the user `admin`.
    *   `disabled=yes`: Disables the account.
*  **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Navigate to `System` > `Users` > `Users` Tab.
    *  Double click the `admin` user.
    *  Check the `Disabled` box.
    *  Click `Apply` and `OK`
*   **Before Configuration State:** The user admin is enabled.
*   **After Configuration State:** The user admin is disabled.
*   **Effect:** The default admin user is disabled, reducing potential security risks. You can always re-enable in case you lose access.
    **Important Note:** Always disable the default "admin" account and create a new user with a strong password for improved security.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-64 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-64 interface=ether1
/ip address
add address=84.24.96.1/24 interface=bridge-64
/user group
add name=admins policy=read,write,test,password,web,ftp,reboot,policy,winbox,local
/user
add name=your_username group=admins password=your_password
/user set admin disabled=yes
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Issue:** Bridge interface doesn't pass traffic.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure that Ethernet interfaces are added to the bridge (`/interface bridge port print`). Make sure no IP addressing exists on physical interfaces added to bridge.
*   **Issue:** Can't log in with new user.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that the user's password is correctly typed in. Double check group permissions. Make sure the user is enabled.
*   **Issue:** Default admin user is still enabled.
    *   **Solution:** Make sure the command `/user set admin disabled=yes` is executed.
*   **Issue:** Unable to access the web interface.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the `web` policy is added to the admin group. Check for firewall rules that might block access.
*   **Issue:** High CPU/Memory usage.
    *   **Solution:** Check resource utilization using `/system resource print`. Optimize your configuration by disabling unused services, ensure the router has enough resources and memory.
*   **Issue:** Loss of access to RouterOS after disabling "admin"
    *   **Solution:** Connect to the router by MAC address in Winbox, then reenable "admin", or ensure the password is correctly input for new user, or you are connecting on the correct interface.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

*   **Ping:** `ping 84.24.96.1` from another device on the same subnet. Verify that you get a reply from the Mikrotik Router.
*   **Login:**  Try logging into Winbox with the created user and password `your_username` and `your_password`.
*   **Interface Status:** Run `/interface print` and `/interface bridge print` command in the CLI to see bridge status.
*   **User Status:** Run `/user print` and `/user group print` command in the CLI to verify user and group configurations.
*   **Check Resource Usage:** Run `/system resource print` command in the CLI to check for high resource utilization.
*   **Web Interface:** Try accessing the web interface of the router using `https://84.24.96.1`.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **User Manager:** For more complex user management needs, consider using MikroTik's User Manager with Radius authentication.
*   **Firewall:** Be sure to implement proper firewall rules to protect the router.  Consider filtering ports, blocking specific IPs and creating a more complex firewall.
*   **Logging:** Configure logging to monitor the router for any issues. Be sure to export logs to an external server for storage and monitoring.
*   **VPN:** Set up a VPN server on the router to access the network remotely.
*   **RouterOS Software Update:** Always keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version, to resolve security vulnerabilities and have access to new features.
*   **Backup Configuration:** Regularly backup RouterOS configuration, either to file or cloud storage.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While there isn't an API call to create a bridge interface directly in RouterOS using the REST API as far as this writer knows, you can use it to manage users and user groups.

### Example 1: Creating a User

*   **Endpoint:** `/rest/user`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "api_user",
        "group": "admins",
        "password": "api_password"
     }
    ```
    **Request Header: ** `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Expected Response (Success 201 Created):**

    ```json
    {
      ".id": "*1",
      "name": "api_user",
      "group": "admins",
      "comment": "",
      "disabled": false
    }
    ```
*  **Expected Response (Error):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "already have user with the same name",
        "error": true
     }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `name`: Username for the new user.
    *   `group`: The user group to which the user will be added.
    *   `password`: The user's password.
*  **Error Handling:** The api will respond with the `error` value as `true` if any issues happened during the request.

### Example 2: Getting a User's Details

*   **Endpoint:** `/rest/user/api_user` (replacing `api_user` with a specific username)
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **JSON Payload:** None needed.
    **Request Header:** `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Expected Response (Success 200 OK):**

    ```json
    {
      ".id": "*1",
      "name": "api_user",
      "group": "admins",
      "comment": "",
      "disabled": false
    }
    ```
*  **Expected Response (Error):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "no such item",
        "error": true
     }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *  The URL parameter `api_user` specifies the user we want to fetch.
*   **Error Handling:** The api will respond with the `error` value as `true` if any issues happened during the request.

### Example 3: Setting an user as `disabled`

*   **Endpoint:** `/rest/user/api_user` (replacing `api_user` with a specific username)
*   **Method:** `PATCH`
*   **JSON Payload:**
    ```json
        {
          "disabled": true
        }
    ```
    **Request Header:** `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Expected Response (Success 200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      ".id": "*1",
      "name": "api_user",
      "group": "admins",
      "comment": "",
      "disabled": true
    }
    ```
*  **Expected Response (Error):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "no such item",
        "error": true
     }
    ```
*   **Explanation:**
    *  The URL parameter `api_user` specifies the user we want to modify.
    *  The JSON payload specifies that we want to set the user to disabled.
*   **Error Handling:** The api will respond with the `error` value as `true` if any issues happened during the request.

**Important Note:**
*   Ensure that the REST API is enabled in RouterOS `IP` > `Services`.
*   Use proper authentication headers for API calls. Check MikroTik documentation on how to implement this.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Disable Default Admin:** As shown, disable the default 'admin' account.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for user accounts.
*   **Limited Access:** Grant the least necessary privileges for user groups.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review user accounts and their assigned groups.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Block unnecessary access to the router's management interfaces from the Internet (e.g., Winbox port 8291).
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Patch known vulnerabilities by updating your router's software.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication:** Consider enabling two-factor authentication for added security when available.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **User Group Specificity:** We can create multiple user groups for different access levels.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Add more firewall rules to secure the network. Consider creating a full firewall configuration.
*   **Remote Logging:** Add a remote logging system for monitoring and security analysis.
*   **Scripting:** Automate this setup with MikroTik scripting capabilities.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Enable detailed logging of user activity.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

### User Management in MikroTik
MikroTik user management is designed to control access to your RouterOS device, but it can also be used for many other purposes, specifically regarding Hotspot and PPP connections. The users are stored in the system database. Each user has its own password, user group, and comment.

### User Groups in MikroTik
User groups are used to apply the same access policy to multiple users. When you create a user, you must add them to a specific group, which will inherit the policies from the groups.

### User Policies
User groups are controlled via `policy`, which is a comma-separated list of permissions that each group has. These include:

*   **read:** Allows reading configurations.
*   **write:** Allows modifying configurations.
*   **test:** Allows running testing commands (like ping).
*   **password:** Allows users to change their own password.
*   **web:** Allows access to the web interface.
*   **ftp:** Allows access via FTP.
*   **reboot:** Allows router reboots.
*   **policy:** Allows changing permissions (very powerful!).
*   **winbox:** Allows access via the Winbox utility.
*   **local:** User is allowed to log in via any available method.
*   **api:** User is allowed to login via the API.
*   **sensitive:** Allow access to sensitive parameters (e.g.: passwords) within the configuration.
*   **ssh:** User is allowed to login via SSH.
*   **telnet:** User is allowed to login via Telnet.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Using a Bridge:** While a bridge simplifies network management by combining interfaces, it also means that the bridge interface becomes the central point of failure. If you need redundancy, you should use more complex technologies such as bonding/trunking.
*   **User Group Policies:** By assigning the full `read,write,...` policy to users, you run the risk of accidental configuration changes. It might be better to create multiple user groups with limited access (read only, for instance).
*   **Disabling Default Admin:** While disabling the `admin` user greatly improves security, it creates the need for another user that has similar permissions. Be sure to take backups, and ensure access through either username/password, or by MAC address for emergencies.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is designed for RouterOS versions 7.x and 6.48+. The bridge and user management features are consistent across these versions. However, always check MikroTik's documentation for your specific version in case of any changes or new features.
