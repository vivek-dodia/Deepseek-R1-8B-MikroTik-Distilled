From the information provided, I can only guess that you have a FastTrack rule on your IPv4 firewall filter table that is incompatible with your IP tunnel.I say that because the Packet Sniffer disables FastPath while running (thus, disables FastTrack too) and that could be the reason your IP tunnel works fine while the Packet Sniffer is running.So, in case you have a FastTrack rule enabled, check if the problem is "solved" by disabling it.
