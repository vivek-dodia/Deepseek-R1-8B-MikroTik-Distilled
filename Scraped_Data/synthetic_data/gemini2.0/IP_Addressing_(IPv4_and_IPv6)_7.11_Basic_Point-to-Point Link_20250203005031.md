Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive documentation for configuring a MikroTik router for a Point-to-Point link, specifically focusing on IP addressing, and encompassing a broad range of relevant MikroTik features and topics.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** We are setting up a basic point-to-point link using the `wlan-14` interface. This link will be for general network connectivity and could connect two buildings or be used for a dedicated backhaul connection.
*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (though the concepts largely apply to 6.48 and other 7.x versions).
*   **Configuration Level:** Basic, suitable for users with some familiarity with network concepts, aiming for a straightforward setup.
*   **Network Scale:** Point-to-Point Link (designed for a dedicated connection).
*   **Subnet:** 200.249.37.0/24
*   **Interface:** `wlan-14` (This could be a physical wireless interface or a virtual interface.)
*   **IP Addressing:** We will configure a static IPv4 address on the interface. For demonstration, we will also include an IPv6 address.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   MikroTik Router running RouterOS (Physical or Virtual).
*   Connectivity between the routers if it is not the first router.
*   Access to the MikroTik via Winbox or CLI (SSH or Console).
*   Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)**

**CLI Implementation:**

*   **Step 1: Assign IPv4 Address to Interface `wlan-14`**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=200.249.37.1/24 interface=wlan-14
    ```

    *   `address`: Specifies the IPv4 address and subnet mask. Here, `200.249.37.1` is the IP, and `/24` is the subnet mask (255.255.255.0).
    *   `interface`: Specifies the interface to which to assign the IP address, which is `wlan-14`.

*  **Step 2: Assign IPv6 Address to Interface `wlan-14`**

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=wlan-14
    ```
    *   `address`: Specifies the IPv6 address and subnet prefix length. Here, `2001:db8::1` is the IPv6 address, and `/64` is the prefix length.
    *   `interface`: Specifies the interface to which to assign the IP address, which is `wlan-14`.

*   **Step 3: Disable DHCP Client (Optional):** If your router is acting as the server and not taking an ip from another source, we need to disable the DHCP client.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-client disable numbers=0
    ```

    *   `numbers=0`:  `0` is the first element, disabling the only DHCP Client if its enabled.

**Winbox Implementation:**

*   **Step 1: Connect to Your MikroTik Router:** Open Winbox, enter your router's IP address/MAC, username, password, and connect.
*   **Step 2: Navigate to `IP -> Addresses`:**  In the left menu, click on `IP`, then `Addresses`.
*   **Step 3: Add IPv4 Address:**
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new address.
    *   In the `Address` field, enter `200.249.37.1/24`.
    *   In the `Interface` dropdown, select `wlan-14`.
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Step 4: Navigate to `IPv6 -> Addresses`:** In the left menu, click on `IPv6`, then `Addresses`.
*   **Step 5: Add IPv6 Address:**
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new address.
    *   In the `Address` field, enter `2001:db8::1/64`.
    *   In the `Interface` dropdown, select `wlan-14`.
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.
*   **Step 6: Disable DHCP Client (Optional):**
    *   Click on `IP` -> `DHCP Client`.
    *   Click on the enabled dhcp client
    *   Click on `Disable`

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands with Relevant Parameters**

```mikrotik
# Example configuration to assign IP addresses to interface 'wlan-14'

# IPv4 Address Assignment
/ip address add address=200.249.37.1/24 interface=wlan-14 comment="Point-to-Point IPv4 address"

# IPv6 Address Assignment
/ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=wlan-14 comment="Point-to-Point IPv6 address"

# Optional: Disable DHCP Client

*   **`comment` parameter:**
    *   `comment=<string>`
    *   Example: `comment="Point-to-Point IPv4 address"` - Adds a description for better documentation

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** If the subnet mask is incorrect (e.g., /23 instead of /24), hosts on the same network will not be able to communicate properly, as this determines the size of the network, which is the main functionality of addressing.
*   **Interface Name Mismatch:** Errors when specifying an incorrect interface name. Use `/interface print` to verify the name.
*   **IP Address Conflicts:** Avoid using IPs that already exist on the network.
*   **Firewall Issues:** The firewall might block traffic on the newly configured interface.
*   **MTU Issues:** If MTU is not consistent across the link it can create connectivity issues.
*   **Double NAT:** Avoid implementing NAT in multiple places in the topology.

**Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:**

*   **`ping`:** Use the `ping <ip_address>` command to verify basic connectivity from the router to another device on the subnet.
    *   Example: `/ping 200.249.37.2`
    *    Example for IPv6:  `/ipv6 ping 2001:db8::2`
*   **`traceroute`:** Use `traceroute <ip_address>` to check the route taken to a given destination.
    *   Example: `/tool traceroute 200.249.37.2`
    *   Example for IPv6: `/ipv6 tool traceroute 2001:db8::2`
*   **`torch`:** Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-14` to examine live network traffic on the interface. This is useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues and identifying the root cause of a problem.
*  **`packet sniffer`:** Can be enabled through Winbox, which can show more detailed information regarding packets that pass through the interface, this can be particularly useful for more specific packet information.
*   **`/log print`:** Check system logs for errors related to IP address assignments.
*  **Interface status checks:** `/interface print` can show the status of the interface, such as its link, mtu, master interface, or any issues related to it.
*   **Winbox Interface Status:** Verify the interface status and IP address configurations in Winbox.

**Error Scenario Example:**

*   **Error:** `invalid value for address (invalid subnet prefix)`
*   **Cause:** Incorrect subnet mask specified. For instance, a prefix /23 when it should be /24.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Review the IP address configuration and ensure the subnet mask is correct.
*   **Resolution:** Correct the subnet mask, e.g., `/ip address set [find interface=wlan-14] address=200.249.37.1/24`.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps Using MikroTik Tools**

*   **Ping from MikroTik:**
    *   Run `/ping 200.249.37.2` (assuming a device with IP 200.249.37.2 is present).
    *   Check for successful ping replies.

*   **Ping from Remote Device:**
    *   Ping the interface's IP address (200.249.37.1) from a device on the same subnet.
    *  Ping the IPv6 address from a device on the same subnet.

*   **Traceroute from MikroTik:**
     *   Run `/tool traceroute 200.249.37.2`
     *   Verify that traceroute gets to the destination without any issues.

*   **Torch:**
    *   Run `/tool torch interface=wlan-14`
    *   Look for the traffic in/out of your device on that interface.

*   **Winbox Interface Monitor:** Check the `Interface` window for real-time traffic statistics.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools:**
    *   Used for dynamically assigning IP addresses with DHCP. In this point-to-point scenario, we are using a static IP address, thus not relevant, but in case of DHCP would work as follows.

        ```mikrotik
       /ip pool add name=my_pool ranges=200.249.37.10-200.249.37.20
        ```
    *   Used to define ranges of IP addresses for dynamic allocation.
*   **IP Routing:**
    *   This is the foundation for how IP traffic flows across networks. In a basic Point-to-Point link, only static routing might be needed if multiple networks are present at the end points.
    *   Example static route: `/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=200.249.37.2`

        *   **UPS:** Connect an UPS to the router for reliable operation.
        *  **Wake on LAN:** Send a wake on LAN request to turn on a device that supports it.
        *   **IP packing:** Pack multiple IP packets into one bigger packet.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

To interact with the MikroTik router via REST API, you'll need to first enable and configure it:

1.  **Enable API:** `/ip service enable api` and `/ip service enable api-ssl`

2.  **Set API SSL Certificate**
   ```mikrotik
     /certificate generate-self-signed name=api-cert common-name=api-server
     /ip service set api-ssl certificate=api-cert
   ```

3.  **Authentication**

    -  By default, the API uses the same user/password used by Winbox and SSH
    - You can enable and set permissions for each user.

**Note:** API calls require an `Authorization` header with the correct username and password, usually using Basic Authentication.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6):**
    *   IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. This allows for significantly more addresses with IPv6.
    *   Each interface needs a unique IP address in its subnet.
    *   Subnet masks define the network portion of an IP address. For example, a /24 subnet mask (255.255.255.0) allows up to 254 usable host addresses.

*   **IP Pools:**
    *   IP Pools are used for dynamic address allocation. For example, DHCP leases IP addresses from a pool.
    *   IP Pools help to manage the usage of the ip address scope by an address.

*   **IP Routing:**
    *   Routing determines how network traffic moves from one point to another.
    *   A router makes routing decisions based on routing tables, which contain information about the network topology.
    *   Static routing requires manual configuration of routes.
    *   Dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) automatically learn and adapt to network changes.

*   **IP Settings:**
    *   This is where we define system wide IP parameters such as:
        *   Arp timeout
        *   ICMP redirects
        *   Loose and Strict policies
    *   These settings are rarely changed but are fundamental to the way the device will handle IP traffic.

*   **Bridging and Switching:**
    *   Bridges operate at Layer 2 (Data Link), forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses.
    *   Switches also function at Layer 2, creating a network at the data link layer.
    *   MikroTik's switching features can operate at Layer 2 and Layer 3, with specific chips that support hardware offloading, which increase the performance.

*   **Firewall:**
    *   Firewalls protect network from unauthorized access.
    *   RouterOS implements stateful firewalls, tracking active connections and enabling complex rules.
    *   Firewall filter rules are based on a sequence of actions, that are matched sequentially, and will stop as soon as a matching rule is found.

*   **Quality of Service (QoS):**
    *   QoS prioritizes and manages network traffic to ensure critical applications get the necessary bandwidth and can also be used to throttle less important traffic.
    *   RouterOS has multiple ways to implement QoS, using simple queues and complex tree structures.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Change Default Passwords:** Immediately change the default user password (`admin`).
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services that are not required (e.g., Telnet, MAC server if not used).
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strong firewall rules to block all unnecessary inbound connections. Only allow necessary ports.
*   **Secure API Access:**  Use HTTPS, not HTTP, for API access and strong authentication.
*   **Regular RouterOS Updates:** Regularly update RouterOS to the latest stable version.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Create complex passwords for all users.
*   **Limit Access:** Grant only
