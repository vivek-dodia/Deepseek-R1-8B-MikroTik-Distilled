## Bridge Setup in MikroTik RouterOS 7.12

### Configuration Scenario and Requirements

**Goal:** Configure a bridge to connect multiple devices on a local network.

**Requirements:**

- MikroTik RouterOS 7.12 or later
- Two or more network interfaces

### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define the Bridge Interface**

```
/interface bridge add name=bridge1
```

**2. Add Interfaces to the Bridge**

```
/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
/interface bridge port add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
```

**3. Assign IP Address to the Bridge**

```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1
```

### Complete Configuration Commands

```
/interface bridge add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1
/interface bridge port add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Pitfall:** Forgetting to add the interfaces to the bridge.

**Solution:** Check the `Interface List` and make sure the desired interfaces are listed under the bridge.

**Pitfall:** Incorrect IP address assignment.

**Solution:** Ensure the IP address assigned to the bridge is unique and within the desired subnet.

### Verification and Testing Steps

**1. Check Interface Status**

```
/interface bridge print
```

**2. Ping Devices on the Bridge**

```
/ping address=192.168.1.2
```

### Related Features and Considerations

**STP:** Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) can be enabled on the bridge to prevent network loops.

**MAC Address Filtering:** MAC address filtering can be enabled on the bridge to restrict access to specific devices.

**Security:** To improve security, consider using VLANs to segment traffic on the bridge.

**Note:** The commands and configuration steps may slightly differ for RouterOS 6.x. Refer to the official RouterOS documentation for the specific version you are using.
