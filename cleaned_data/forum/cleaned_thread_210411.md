## Initial Question
Can we upgrade zerotier and add Moon functionality?Zerotier is now version 1.14. ---

## Response 1
The option to add your ownuser-defined root servers(moons) was introduced back in Zerotier v1.2.0 but unfortunately there’s still no way to manage these settings in ROS. You can add the root servers yourself in a private server, container or VPS. ---

## Response 3
