Up.Also, is there a more official forum for feature requests? I don't want to submit a service ticket just for a wishlist item. ---

Up.Also, is there a more official forum for feature requests? I don't want to submit a service ticket just for a wishlist item.If you go to help.mikrotik.com, there is a category for feature requests. Stuff like adding a setting like MTU on VETH seems like a fair request. ---

## Response 3
I just noticed. I guess container development on routers is a recent thing. Using a mtu 1500 in an environment that should be similar to a loopback is not what I expected. ---
