If you did not set keys and client ids I doubt it works, but you can installcurlinside client container to test over xray socks proxy:Code:Select allAlso you could temporary setup file logging in xray configuration on both sides while testing to some location in container and examine logs, seehttps://xtls.github.io/en/config/log.html

Well i guess i failed. I used this config (only changed hostname:443) and apparently i did something wrong in the config:https://computerscot.github.io/wireguard-over-xray.htmlCode:Select allEdit:Now i added this to inbounds:Code:Select alland the output now is a bunch of stuff in log, that i don't realy understand but i'm guessing, that the tunnel is working. In acess.log i found this:Code:Select allThis is just part of the output:Code:Select allNow i just have to figure out how to put wireguard on top of all this.On client Mikrotik i added new wireguard interface (MTU 1300) with IP 10.20.20.2/24 listenning on 51822 and a peer with endpoint 127.0.0.1:51822 (i used this port, because 51820 is already occupied. I fixed port number in config.json also).On server Mikrotik i added new wireguard interface (MTU 1300) with IP 10.20.20.1/24 listening on 51822 and a peer with Allowed Adress 10.20.20.2/32Still nothing happens. Can you see what did i miss from my settings?How to enter this rule: "Xray container has access on input chain for UDP 12884 (WG port) for establishing connection to ROS WG"  ?

```
/ip/firewall/filteraddaction=accept chain=input dst-port=<WG_LISTEN_PORT>protocol=udp src-address=<XRAY_SERVER_CONTAINER_IP>
```

First change"dokodemo-door"protocol config on client side - this is tunneling config where you need to setup tunnel listening port and to where on other end (server side) connection (WG IP and port) needs to be established, set"listen"to address of any interface in container - "0.0.0.0", in my config is set to "127.0.0.1" because I'm running xray and WG client localy on computer, not in container. Then,"settings"->"address"and"settings"->"port"must be set to IP and port of WG peer on server side (responder), set to address of server side xray container subnet gw (router IP in subnet) and port to where WG is listening on server side. Also in client side WG config endpoint address and port must be xray client container ip and port value of"dokodemo-door"->"port"setting - on this port xray is listening for tunnel conection.How to enter this rule: "Xray container has access on input chain for UDP 12884 (WG port) for establishing connection to ROS WG"  ?For this I'm referring on server side where xray container must be able to connect to its router IP and WG port (for tunnel settings indokodemo-doormentioned above), depends how your rules are currently made, is curently container isolated or not, etc... Maybe connection already works, try it, if not, you can try with rule on server side:Code:Select allabove last "defconf: drop all..." rule and below "defconf: drop invalid.." input rules if you have "defconf" rules.For client side, since client xray is also in container and WG client is actually ROS WG peer (initiator), WG endpoint connection to xray client container IP and listening tunel port must be alowed if container is isolated for connections from router. If ping to container IP from router is responding than it is probably allowed, all depends on your current rules...

So isn't dokodemo-door configuration ok for my use case, where Wireguard client and Wireguard server are both on Mikrotik devices and also XRAY containers are on Mikrotik devices?Ok, so first i had to make a working wireguard config over regular wan connection and that is working now.Then i changed endpoint adress on my wireguard peer to XRAY container IP and port number set in the client config.jsonContainers are not isolated, i can acess them from everywhere.Now i will try to implement those things you mentioned. It seems a bit complicated to meI'm attaching current client config and server config file if you can take a look at it:Client:Code:Select all10.20.20.1 is the IP of the wireguard interface on server and 51822 is port on the wireguard server.Server:Code:Select allI have to take a little rest from this, my head hurts when i just look at config fileFeel free to edit current files and attach them here, if you can find some time.I will try to continue in the evening.Thank you for your help.Edit: Configuration fixed to a working state.

Don't have mentioned issue after upgradingXraycontainer for server side on ROS to version 24.12.15Code:Select allstill my client version on Mac is older, 1.8.24, MacPorts package is slower on updates for it, but it is not that old as it seems by version number (https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/tags?after=v24.9.16, they reversed version numbers after 1.8.24, idk why..., but it still all works with same configuration on both sides.Also, I think it is enough of hijacking this topic, better open new one forXrayin ROS container in "3rd party tools" section, since this conversation is gone OT.
