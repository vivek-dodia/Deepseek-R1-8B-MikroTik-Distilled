# Introduction
Shielded cable installation infrastructure (towers and masts), as well as antennas and the router itself, must be properly grounded. Lightning arresters must be installed on all external antenna cables (near the antennas or on the antennas themselves) to prevent equipment damage and human injury. Note that lightning arresters will not be effective if they are not properly grounded.
Use 1 AWG (7 mm in diameter) wire with corrosion-resistant connectors for grounding. Ensure that the grounding infrastructure you use is fully functional (not merely decorative, as seen in some installations).
