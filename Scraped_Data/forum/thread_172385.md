```
/system package update check-for-updates; /system package update install;
```

```
/system routerboard print; /system routerboard upgrade; /system reboot;
```

Is there a 1 liner to upgrade RouterOS and firmware at the same time?At the moment I have to update RouterOS:Code:Select allAnd then firmwareCode:Select allSo need to reboot 2 times .... is it possible to do it in one command with one reboot?

```
/system routerboard settings set auto-upgrade=yes
```

```
/system routerboard upgrade
```

It is not possible to upgrade routerboot before device reboots to upgraded ROS version. The only corner that can be cut is to setCode:Select allwhich saves administrator from executingCode:Select allafter ROS upgrade. Another reboot is still necessary.

Another reboot is still necessary.So if I understand that correctly, when I set routerboard to Auto-Upgrade it will reboot 2x as well when it upgrades ROS/firmware?
