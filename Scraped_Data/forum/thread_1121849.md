Hi, with ROS v7.17 MT enforced a strict device-mode regime:!) device-mode - after upgrade, mode "enterprise" is renamed to "advanced" and traffic-gen, partition (command "repartition"), routerboard and install-any-version features will be disabled;In my opinion, there MUST be a way to monitor these vital values through a common monitoring system (like SNMP).But there is nothing in the mikrotik.mib:mt-mib.jpgHow can we monitor (e.g. in PRTG or Zabbix) the "flagged-state", the device mode and the state of every feature?values.jpgNot even a SNMP-trap is there...
