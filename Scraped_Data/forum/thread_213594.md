Ok, for starters you would have to download ISRG ROOT X1 and R10 and R11 as .pem, add them to the router's files ajd import themCode:Select allAfter that, you would create an IPsec profile and proposal:Code:Select allNext, you would configure a policy group and a policy template for the traffic to be sent over the tunnel:Code:Select allFollowing, you add a mode configuration which would be later set to forward the desired traffic through the VPN:Code:Select allFurther, you would add a peer and an identity - the most important parts; because in peer you add the address/DNS of the server you connect to and in identity the username and password:Code:Select allLastly, after all this is done, you would need to consider traffic from which subnets should be sent over the tunnel by adding them in a firewall address list and adding the list itself in the mode-config settings:Code:Select allFYI, the structure of my answer is based on the following article from the MikroTik Docs where there are more detailed explanations but for another VPN vendor:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... d+RouterOS

thanks for the answerTheCat12, first I focused on installing Phase 1 and turned on logging, so i saw that i need to enable sha256, for that created a new profile:/ip ipsec profile add enc-algorithm=aes-256,aes-128,3des hash-algorithm=sha256 name=profile1after that i imported R10 and R11 certificates, and Phase 1 was successfully installed, I think my mistake at this stage was related to the fact that I did not specify eap-methods=eap-mschapv2 and excessive selection of certificatesafter 5-10 seconds Phase 1 is canceled because no policy was created, but then I created the necessary settings and everything workednow everything works, but I see that on the local computer that gets access to the Internet through this tunnel, it takes a very long time to open pages, although I see that ping and nslookip are working fine. perhaps I still need to check the local network settings.yes, that's MTU, added/ip firewall mangle add chain=forward connection-mark=mark1 action=change-mss new-mss=1380 protocol=tcp tcp-flags=syn passthrough=yesand it worked. thanks again for the help!
