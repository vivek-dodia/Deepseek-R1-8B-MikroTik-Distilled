Here is my configuration.I saw people say that not to mess with the config if you don't know what you are doing, so I kept it simple.Code:Select allHere is my full configurationhttps://pastebin.com/JFju0uA8.Can you spot something?

One thing to keep in mind: permitted Tx power is not the same on all 5GHz channels. If you check output ofCode:Select allyou'll see that some channels have limit quite a bit lower than others. In order to have signal strength (and coverage) predictable, it's good to limit permitted channels to certain range with same allowed Tx power.Another thing to keep in mind (not saying this is the issue here, but quite often it is): too high signal strength is not good either (it's similar to standing next to loudspeaker, operating at 100dBA+ ... your ears hurt and you can't hear what's being transmitted). WiFi connection typically works best when signal level at receiver is around -40dBm (higher than -30dBm "hurts" and lower than -50dBm starts to sense noise/interference). Placing wifi client less than say 1m from AP is typically too close.

Thank you for your thorough explanation. I ran the command and here is the outputCode:Select allI have read and understood your comment, but tbh, I am not sure how can I apply it. Do you have some specific recommendation for me what to try next?
