For what purpose?

What @normis is saying (but in more words): in principle every device, running ROS, offers same functionality (apart from models with 16MB flash which is tight and doesn't allow to install all the optional ROS packages). But devices differ wildly when it comes to capacity when running those functions. So if your main goal is learning how to ROS, then you can go with some low-end device (with consideration about storage/flash space). If you have in your mind some particular task for the device, then we might be able to give you an advice (or two), but you have to describe that task (in detail).

Because im planning to run small business offering wifi to neighbors through litebeam or powerbeam. Everything is planned and prepared exept the device that can manage and allow me to have control over users.Any advice and tips highly appreciated and will be noted.Ty

https://mikrotik.com/product/rb5009ug_s_inWow, based on its features its amazingly insane!All mik routerboards run same RouterOS no?

Yes, the same OS is on all devices. There are some small differrences in License level, but this one already has a good license level with not many limits.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ekeylevels

Same ROS but depending on the model they have different levels of licence that limits some functions eg. max number of connections:https://wiki.mikrotik.com/Manual:LicenseOf course the efficiency for small & cheap device is different than the big & insanepriced oneAlthough the "insane priced" is quite cheap if you get fully flagged fast and supported for a long long time device  in comparision to other vendors.

Do not buy switch for use it as router.

The "key" is IMHO your ISP connection speed more than anything else.If it is below 1 Gb speed, you can get a hex refresh (or even a hap ax lite) as a first device on the cheap (with 5 or 4 ports) around 60$.If it is 1 Gb the "right" device is the hap Ax3 (5 ports) 140$.If it is more than 1 Gb - as BartoszP advised - go for the RB5009 (8 ports+the SFP socket) 220$.Of course the latter is the more future-proof choice at the moment, and surely it is the "entry level" for a business offering like the one you plan, then the amount of customers/clients may make you shift towards a more powerful device, such as one of the CCR series, but the good thing about these Mikrotik devices is that - within limits - they can be re-used in other roles, as managed or "dumb" switch, just as an example, so you can start with *any* device and when you get a new, more powerful one, the old one can be re-used in other projects/setups.

I believe RB5009UG fulfill the requirements of bein mid range routerAnd yes clients aint gonna be many. I believe maximum is 30 clients, the RB5009UG gonna do its job in this situation?

IMO @rextended gives good advice; I recently bought RB5009 for router on a stick deployment.CRS305-1G-4S+IN $149.00CRS326-24G-2S+IN $199.00RB5009UG+S+IN $219.00CRS309-1G-8S+IN $269.00CRS3xx devices supportL3 Hardware Offloadingwhich can route and firewall at wire speed for some cases; thelearning curve is steep. See forum topichow does L3HW actually works?If you have tight budgetANDfirewall rules are simpleANDclient count is small then CRS3xx may work for youbut don't go this route without verifying your requirements fit within L3HW limits.

My brain farted im sorry, can we speak in terms of noob level? *_*You want a plumber comparison?Imagine that in your house there are 9 bathrooms, a kitchen, an outdoor tap in the garden and one in the garage.That makes roughly 30 taps, each 1/2".If you want to have all of them open at the same time you need to deliver to your home enough water.Roughly, a 1" pipe will provide enough water for 4 such taps. So you need 6 or 7 of these 1" pipes. But a 2" pipe Is enough, still roughly, for 4 x 1" pipes, and a 2 1/2" Is enough for 6 of them.In reality you can have reasonably at the most 10 to 20 of the 30 taps open at the same time and in a same bathroom you are not going to have more than two taps open fully a the same time so you can have  distribution lines 3/4" and a 2" pipe from the main line in the road to your house is enough.Along this water line you will have fitted at least a gate valve, a water meter and a second (gate or ball) valve.Of course these will be as well 2" diameter, to avoid bottlenecks. If you fit smaller ones the amount of water available will be reduced.Same goes for the main distribution lines, if you use 3/4" pipes, section valves will also need to be 3/4".Internet and networks are not that much different in principle, the router needs to be able to let pass through all the speed and bandwidth the ISP can deliver, then the switch(es) and the network connections behind the router need to be able to distribute It.But It makes little sense to have a router capable of (say) 5 Gb if the ISP cannot provide more than 1 Gb, or viceversa have a 1 Gb network if the ISP and router can deliver 5 Gb.All elements in the chain need to be dimensioned in such a way to not create bottlenecks.The easy way Is to get the most powerful devices available, if budget Is not an issue.Since usually there are limits to what you can spend, you need to carefully estimate the needs/requirements first and then choose the hardware that can deliver what is planned at the lower possible cost, allowing some reasonably slack.Forum members may be able to give you advice on the hardware that is more suitable to fulfill the requirements and possibly also help you in calculating these requirements,  the more details you can provide, the more accurate/appropriate the advice can be.

Also, dont think just about today.  Plan ahead, what will likely occur in the next five years.An investment in a router should cover at least that time span.  In other words, is your ISP throughput likely to be the same or increase?

But as for a start till i build and start the first step do you think the RB5009U will do its purpose?

Once, 10+ years ago, I had a chance to collect data for multibranch company that used centralized system in 24/7 mode and all employees were connected all working day to central system + circa 70 people in main office used same line for everyday mail, browsing, music etc.The average throughput was at 4Mb for a whole year. Day+night+holidays .... insane when you compare it to peak traffic when you can "eat as much as you want".

I guess i will reconsider my decision abt rb5009*_* soooo now im convinced to invest in better router thoughts on rb1100x4?

RB1100AHx4 do not have SFP and all ports are only gigabit.

Since you say possibly 1.5gbps will come for your ISP in 5 years what's the problem ?Rb5009 will be more then enough.
