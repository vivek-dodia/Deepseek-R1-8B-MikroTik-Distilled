Hello,I’ve configured WireGuard on my MikroTik router (version 7.16), and it’s working correctly for one peer (Hamed-PC). This peer is able to connect, access the internet, and use the tunnel without any issues. However, for a second peer (Omid), the handshake is successfully established, but no traffic passes through the tunnel.Here’s my configuration:Interface Configuration:Code:Select all/interface wireguard
add listen-port=40443 mtu=1420 name=WG private-key="QFBD8AfDtRK0UKxBcYw9lBYvDvlgGO29hnBNXC44jXM="Peers Configuration:Code:Select all/interface wireguard peers

Any insights or suggestions for additional troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance!

Hi,I think that it's a common misunderstanding (I had to learn it myself) that the definition of "allowed-address" on the responder side allows any packets from the peer to the responder. This has to be done on the config on the client!I usually set* on the responder:  allowed-address= to the client wg-address/32* on client: allowed-address= to the responder wg-address/32 plus responder network/24 or 0.0.0.0/0 for responder acting as default gateway)then try to ping the responders wg-inteface-ip from the client first.Start with minimal complexity and then get more complex.Maybe this helps.Ralf.

Think about the  logic.   One should  understand the function of allowed addresses:.On  inbound, it checks if the remote source address coming in is on the list!On outbound, it checks in order of the rules as they appear, a.  does the destination exist. and b. assign it to the right peer.The first peer has an allowed IP address of 0.0.0.0/  therefore any traffic outbound will never hit the second peer.Put it another way, the  return  traffic from the second peer will always go back out the first peer and is thus effectively  dropped.The server for handshake rarely has 0.0.0.0/0  to any peer for this reason.If you need one, for example to go out the internet of a peer client  router,  then the suggestion  is a  second wireguard interface just for this purpose.Allowed IPs is to identifya.  remote subnets,IP one  wishes to connect toORb. remote subnets,  IP   coming to the local router.o.o.o.o/o  is logical at the client devices on the their peer settings identifying the router!WhY all the noise,  get rid of it.   This  is all you neeed/interface wireguard peersadd allowed-address=192.168.10.100/32 interface=WG name=Hamed-P   public-key="+++++add allowed-address=192.168.10.101/32 interface=WG name=Omid public-key="======="

@hamed,Checked WireGuard logs for both the router and the Omid client.Pinged the Omid IP address (192.168.10.101) from the router but received no response.and what did those log and ping results say?
