Hi guys,I'm very new in the Miktrotic game. I'll be moving into a new house end of this year. The house is currently in early construction. I have to following concrete needs:2x PoE Wifi Access Point (very likely Unify U6+)2x PoE Zigbee Coordinator/Router1x PoE Video Doorbell2x Ethernet (option to have more)There will be 1Gbit/s fiber from Deutsche Telekom, however I'll most likely start with 300Mbit/s as I'm currently doing fine with the 50Mbit/s right now.Now to the question w.r.t hardware setup1. Basic setup:1x ISP ONT (50€) + 1x hEX refresh (ca. 70€) + 1x Zyxel Switch GS1900-8HP (ca. 100€)2. Fancy/clean setup:1x GPON module (40€) + RB5009UPr+S+IN (ca. 270€)Router wise I'd like to set up VLANs to shield off IoT devices/Guest Wifi properly. Nothing fancy planned apart from that but suggestions more than welcome. Port wise it is on the edge I know.Objectively overall energy consumption doesn't really make an impact in favor of the RB5009UPr+S+IN. Is there a good reason to invest the +100€ now or should I simply stick to the basic setup and make a bigger infrastructure shift once speeds > 1Gbit/s are to be expected? Apart from that: do you have a better suggestion in terms of router/switches to be installed?Thank you guys and have a nice day!BestDavid

If the 1 Gb is on the horizon but not too near I would go for the hex refresh, you will find other ways to re-use it or however it will likely be easy to resell.If nothing more than 1 Gb is expected maybe you could consider an Ax3 as "main router" (whether you use or not its wi-fi as one of the two AP or as an additional one or you don't use it at all you can decide later).But maybe you are planning too much in the future, you never know if new devices will come out in ten months time (Mikrotik or other manufacturer).

If the ONT provides a public IP, I would probably go that route, if it doles out only a private IP and you cannot forward ports on it etc,  ( no access to the public IP)  then would go for the direct connection.Reason for hesitation on GPON, being is that incompatibility of ISP and mikrotik traffic over GPONs has been an issue at times in the past, dont know the current state of things.  I would be happier if you know someone using your ISP and has used GPONS of some vendor with success.  Check out local forums!!Definitely go for the 5009 as the core router.  It has the room for growth you need.   It has one 2.5 gb port and  one sfp+ port.In this way you could connect the 5009 to a core switch at 2.5 gigs or 10gigs and then feed the house from that switch.Something like the CRS310-8G+2S+IN  which consists of 8 2.5 gig ports and 2 sfp+ 10 gig ports( one sfp+  to connect to 5009 ) and then you have 8 ports capable of 1 or 2.5 gigs.WHY you ask -->   If I look at all TP Link Access points, they come with2.5g standard portnow!What do the UNIFIs have??Additionally the 5009, can handle three WAN connections at 1 gig each or one 2.5 gig wan connection.
