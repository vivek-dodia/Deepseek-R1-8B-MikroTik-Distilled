I'm trying to configure my rb951 to access Internet from ISP router but after setting the static IP ( 192.168.100.100/24)  and checking routes and when I try to ping google.comDoes your ISP support DHCP as means of obtaining IP config for clients? If it does, then use it, it's usually less error-prone than static setup.According to error messages you posted it's likely that you didn't set IP address(es) of DNS servers for router to use.
