Hi,So on a recent switch such as the CRS310-8G+2S+IN, assuming I already have some vlans configured on the bridge interface (/interface/bridge/vlan) and that my management vlan is 1, where is it recommended to configure the switch own management IP ?a) directly on the bridge interface with PVID=1 (/interface/bridge) ?b) or on a new vlan 1 interface on the switch ? (/interface/vlan) ?From what I read I think the good answer is b), but why? What kind of issues could arise in assigning an IP to the bridge directly?Thanks!
