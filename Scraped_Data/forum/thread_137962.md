```
:foreach user in=[/ip firewall address-list find find address=10.2.2.2] do={

   /ip firewall address-list disable $user
}
```

```
ip firewall address-list disable [/ip firewall address-list find address=10.2.2.2]
```

UsingPEAR2_Net_RouterOS-1.0.0b6The following works fine the in the Mikrotik Terminal. But I cant get it to work via the API. How would I do the following:Code:Select allOrCode:Select all

```
$util = new RouterOS\Util($client);
$util->setMenu('/ip firewall address-list')->disable(RouterOS\Query::where('address', '10.2.2.2'));
```

```
$ids = array();
$util->setMenu('/ip firewall address-list');
foreach ($util->getAll(array('.proplist' => '.id'), RouterOS\Query::where('address', '10.2.2.2')) as $item) {
    $ids[] = $item('.id');
}
$util->disable(implode(',', $ids));
```

Easiest would be:Code:Select allAlthough there is a bug with Util and queries with multiple matches that's already fixed in the upcoming version... Until that version is released, if you have more than one match, you could use:Code:Select all
