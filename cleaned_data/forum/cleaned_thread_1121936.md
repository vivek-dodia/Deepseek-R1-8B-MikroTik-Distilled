## Initial Question
I often need to get few lines of log from log view n Winbox but there is no copy option.It would be great we can select part of log and copy it as text. ---

If you do not have a knife use a fork ... one of many MacGyver's rules. ---

pedja, I thought you stopped being spoon fed long ago??Terminal is a selection in winbox, at the prompt your telling us you are unable to type 10 characters /log/print ??Further you expect the developers to waste time on this and not all the far more important actual bug fixes etc...........This would fall into the realm of nice to have and in the software world, target of opportunity fix, vice selected to be in any build. ---

workaroundopen terminal/log/printand copy what you wantThis is a joke, right?The other way to look at is someone being helpful. Now if I'm looking at the log view in winbox...I'm probably not already in a terminal...so that quite a few steps. But Winbox's log view in general could use many improvements (export CSV, human date, simplified filtering, multiline view, etc.)... while CLI is pretty rich for finding/printing logs (print's where, proplist=, follow, etc.).But I'm a +1 on the idea. The clipboard hasdatatypes, so could store it BOTH as table and plain text (like print) formats. If it's a table format, the "paste side" work with a spreadsheet to dump the log into. And it be totally reasonable given winbox4 is still under-development â€” stuff like cut-and-paste should work without thought ideally & if you have stuff selected in a winbox log view, copy should work... ---

Thats why I said target of opportunity AMMO. If its low hanging fruit in the software vernacular, by all means go for it.I was assuming that its difficult and time consuming to program, your sense is otherwise based on better knowledge of the gubbins of available functionality.If its as easy as copy and paste LOL, then its a toggle switch maybe at the top of the winbox log selection (toggle normal view, and copy-able view).Suggest OP go to the support page, create a login and submit the idea. Stating plus1, gets no one anywhere. ;-PPS. Its not too late to join Canada as another Province!! ---
