Hello all,I have a CCR as my root bridge and 2 CRS switches connected to it.  The CRS switches are not connected to each other.Both CRS switches have a port-channel (bond) to the CCR.  When 1 crs switch is connected to the ccr only, connectivity is fine.  As soon as I connect the 2nd crs switch to the CCR, STP starts discarding traffic, then listens and forwards.  It just goes in a constant circle.  There is no physical loop so I'm not sure what is going on.I do have the bridge priority set on the CCR so that it becomes the root bridge but I don't believe anything else needs to be done.Can anyone give some insight?Screenshots attached showing the packetloss at the exact same time as well as the log showing the stp states.

Quick update:I removed the bond on the 2nd crs switch that goes to the CCR.  Then things started working properly and spanning tree wasn't discarding traffic anymore...Does mikrotik not like having more than one bond?The CCR is currently on 7.8 and CRS's on 6.49.17.

Genrally multiple bonds work fine on ROS devices. So it might be domething about how you set them up ... both on CCR and both CRSes.If you post config from all 3 devices (the /interface part will probably be enough), we may spot domething off ...

Why is the CRS priority set to 0xFFFF? The standard requires the lower 12 bits to be zero, e.g. 0xF000 to be the lowest priority.
