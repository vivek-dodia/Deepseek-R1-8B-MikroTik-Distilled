Hello,I use the "BTest Server" and the "Bandwidth Test" client between a 4G WAP LTE router and a CCR on a fiber link.Most of the time it works well, except on some 4G operator which blocks the TCP 2000 port ...How could I modify the TCP port "BTest Server" and the client "Bandwidth Test" in order to make them work when the TCP port 2000 is blocked?Thanks for your help.

Hello Team,i hav the same topic.fortigate in standard config can not forward the port 2000.https://community.fortinet.com/t5/Forti ... a-p/338769please make the port flexible.A variable port can also help me to test the connection in the SD-WAN individually.(we use an AAR that makes it possible to assign different ports or applications to the appropriate path)Best Christmas wishes.Marcus
