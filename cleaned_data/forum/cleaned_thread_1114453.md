## Initial Question
Can it act as switch only, without routing, vlan ect ?. ---

## Response 1
Sure.That's how it default starts.You only need to look at the IP address, rest of config default starts as a pure switch (because ... that's what it is !). ---

## Response 2
Look at IP adress?, you mean set on them IP in range of what router passes ? ---

## Response 3
Yes.Surely your default subnet is not going to be 192.168.88.0/24, is it ? ---

## Response 4
Yes, alright, that i will config proper way. ---

## Response 5
Yes it can act as a router but the routing throughput is not the same as switching throughput. ---

## Response 6
Another option is the CRS326 is dual boot, so it can be configured to use SwitchOS. Makes a great fully managed switch. ---
