Okay, let's dive deep into a comprehensive MikroTik configuration for your specified scenario, covering a wide range of topics relevant to a skilled RouterOS engineer. This document will be extensive due to the requirements.

# MikroTik RouterOS Configuration: IP Routing on VLAN 57

This document provides an expert-level configuration for IP routing on a MikroTik router, focusing on the subnet `130.199.123.0/24` and interface `vlan-57`. We'll cover not just the routing but also related topics, as per your requirements.

**Configuration Level:** Expert
**Network Scale:** Enterprise
**RouterOS Version:** 6.48 (and considerations for 7.x)
**Subnet:** 130.199.123.0/24
**Interface:** vlan-57

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** We're setting up a MikroTik router to handle traffic for a specific VLAN (57) within an enterprise network. This involves assigning an IP address to the VLAN interface, ensuring proper routing, and potentially configuring related services like DHCP and firewall rules. The network is assumed to have a higher-level gateway/router responsible for routing to other subnets and the internet.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

-   **VLAN Tagging:** Assumes a trunk interface already configured and `vlan-57` is set to be on VLAN ID 57.
-   **Static IP Assignment:** The router will have a static IP address within the 130.199.123.0/24 subnet on the `vlan-57` interface.
-   **Routing:** The router must know how to route traffic destined for the 130.199.123.0/24 network. In most cases, it is assigned this network so it doesn't need a static route unless there are other routing instances.
-   **Firewall Rules:** Includes basic firewall rules to ensure security for the router and the local subnet.
-   **Optional Features:** This document goes beyond basics to touch upon several advanced topics like DHCP, QoS, and VPN to demonstrate capabilities.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

### Using the CLI (Terminal)

1.  **Accessing the Terminal:**
    *   Connect to your MikroTik router using SSH or via the Web Terminal/Console in Winbox.

2.  **Configure VLAN Interface IP Address:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add name=vlan-57 vlan-id=57 interface=[your_trunk_interface]
    /ip address
    add address=130.199.123.1/24 interface=vlan-57
    ```
    *   **`interface vlan add`**: Creates a new VLAN interface named `vlan-57` with VLAN ID 57 on the designated trunk interface. Replace `[your_trunk_interface]` with the actual name of your trunk interface (e.g., `ether1`).
    *   **`ip address add`**: Assigns the IP address `130.199.123.1/24` to the newly created `vlan-57` interface. This IP will serve as the gateway for clients on that subnet.

3.  **Routing (Implicit for direct attached networks)**
    *   No static route is needed to reach the 130.199.123.0/24. However, if you have multiple routing instances or the gateway is different, the following can be used to configure a default route:
      ```mikrotik
      /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=[your_gateway_ip]
      ```

4.  **Firewall Rules:**

    *   **Allowing essential traffic:** Basic rule to allow traffic from your configured subnets.
      ```mikrotik
      /ip firewall filter
      add chain=input action=accept in-interface=vlan-57 comment="Allow local traffic"
      add chain=input action=drop in-interface=!vlan-57 comment="Drop all other input"
       ```
   *   **Allow Forwarded traffic (traffic through router):** Basic rule to allow routed traffic.
      ```mikrotik
       /ip firewall filter
      add chain=forward action=accept comment="Allow forward"
      ```

### Using Winbox

1.  **Connecting with Winbox:**
    *   Download and install Winbox.
    *   Connect to your MikroTik router using its IP address or MAC address (neighbors discovery).

2.  **Configure VLAN Interface IP Address:**
    *   Go to `Interface` → `VLAN`.
    *   Click `+` (Add).
    *   Set `Name` to `vlan-57`, `VLAN ID` to `57`, and choose your `Interface` from the drop-down.
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.
    *   Go to `IP` → `Addresses`.
    *   Click `+` (Add).
    *   Set `Address` to `130.199.123.1/24`, `Interface` to `vlan-57`.
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.

3.  **Routing:**
    *   Go to `IP` → `Routes`.
    *   Check routes. If the 130.199.123.0/24 network is not listed, add one.
    *   Click `+` (Add).
    *    Set `Dst. Address` to `130.199.123.0/24`.
    *    Set `Gateway` to `connected`.
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.

4.  **Firewall:**
    *   Go to `IP` → `Firewall`.
    *   Go to `Filter Rules`.
    *   Click `+` (Add).
        *   Set `Chain` to `input`.
        *   Set `In. Interface` to `vlan-57`.
        *   Set `Action` to `accept`.
        *   Add a comment such as `Allow local traffic`
    *   Click `+` (Add).
        *   Set `Chain` to `input`.
        *   Set `In. Interface` to `!vlan-57`.
        *   Set `Action` to `drop`.
        *   Add a comment such as `Drop all other input`
   *   Click `+` (Add).
       * Set `Chain` to `forward`.
       * Set `Action` to `accept`.
       * Add a comment such as `Allow forward`
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect VLAN ID or interface:** VLANs not working due to wrong VLAN ID, or VLAN interface is assigned to the wrong physical port.
*   **Incorrect IP Address:** IP is not configured, or the mask is misconfigured.
*   **Missing or Incorrect Firewall Rules:** Firewall blocking the traffic on the interface.
*   **Routing issues:** Routing to this network does not occur as expected.
*   **MTU Mismatch:** MTU mismatches, leading to fragmentation, especially with VPNs.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Low hardware resources causing performance issues.

**Troubleshooting & Diagnostics:**

1.  **Interface Status:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface print
    ```
    *   Verify if `vlan-57` is enabled (`status=running`). Ensure `actual-mtu` is correct.

2.  **IP Address Check:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print
    ```
    *   Verify the IP address is assigned to the correct interface.

3.  **IP Route Check:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route print
    ```
    * Verify `130.199.123.0/24` is present and the correct `gateway` or `interface` is used.

4.  **Ping:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 130.199.123.1
    /ping 130.199.123.x
    ```
    *  Ping the interface and any host on the subnet. `ping` will display the packet loss and latency information.

5.  **Traceroute:**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 130.199.123.x
    ```
    *   To show path towards the remote host.

6.  **Torch:**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=vlan-57
    ```
    *   Real-time packet analysis on interface to see what traffic is going on.
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the torch.

7.  **Firewall Logging:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter set log=yes [find comment="Drop all other input"]
    /log print
    ```
    *   Turn on logging for firewall rules and check `log`. Useful to see if firewall is blocking traffic.

**Error Scenario:**

*   **Issue:** Clients on the 130.199.123.0/24 network cannot access the internet.
*   **Possible Cause:**  Incorrect gateway configuration or a misconfigured firewall rule blocking forward traffic.
*   **Diagnostics:** Use `ping` to check connectivity to the interface itself and to external hosts. Use `traceroute` to see where traffic fails. Check firewall rules for `input`, `forward` and `output` chains.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Interface Status Check:** Use `/interface print` to verify `vlan-57` is active.
2.  **IP Connectivity Check:** Ping the IP of `vlan-57` from the router itself.
3.  **Connectivity to other host:** Ping other hosts from the subnet from the router using `/ping 130.199.123.x`.
4.  **Ping client:**  Ping the router from a device connected to the `vlan-57` subnet.
