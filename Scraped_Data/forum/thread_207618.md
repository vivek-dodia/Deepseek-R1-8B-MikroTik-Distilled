Having IPv6 problems with a CHR RouterOS, 7.14.3 on a virtual host at Hetzner. IPv6 configs (IPIPv6 on top of wireguard tunnels) that work on several physical routers fail on the CHR.Even pinging lo fails, which works on all physical routers:Code:Select allSettings:Code:Select allAny ideas what exactly is failing if /ping ::1 does not work?

Please do the following to make sure:Code:Select allAnd try again. I had similar issue and that was how I realized it was the firewall.

Solved. Stupid user error as usual. Some forgotten obscure pre-wireguard era IPSec test years ago, not relevant until now when IPv6 was deployed:/ip/ipsec/policy/print...1     android-ikev2-peer  yes     ::/0         ::/0         all       encrypt  unique          0Lesson learned: always check firewall rulesandIPSec policies. Thanks to kind souls trying to help.
