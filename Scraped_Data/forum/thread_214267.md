Both tables, mentioned by @panisk0 ... with addition of/interface/ethernet/switch/host... are serving different roles:/ip/arp (and /ipv6/neighbor for IPv6) lists hosts with which IP (or IPv6) stack of router communicated in near past. It contains both IP (or IPv6) address and MAC address of that device, as well as router's interface (which is not the same as bridge port)./interface/bridge/host (and /interface/ethernet/switch/host if bridge is not HW-offloaded but manual config is in place) lists hosts which communicate with each other via bridge (or switch chip). And it doesn't matter if bridge can be offloaded or not, each bridge needs it. This table will contain MAC addresses and bridge/switch ports, but won't show IP address ...

```
/ip/arp/printwheremac-address=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
```

Thanks for your input! Yeah ip arp is one option but I cannot search based on mac. Anyway my question was a bit off to begin with because routers don't generally build mac tables (ccr1072 doesn't even have a switch chip).Code:Select allSwitch chips have internal MAC table that is independent with respect to RourerOS Linux kernel ARP table which is built to allow router IPv4 address to MAC address translation.
