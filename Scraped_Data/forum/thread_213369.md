Hi there,I recently migrated to a RB5009. There is only one feature from my old setup that is not yet working again on RouterOS. I have a guest WiFi that has its own VLAN, vlan.180.guest, and I'd like to make sure that it is isolated from all other VLANs and its traffic is routed through a WireGuard VPN, wg180, which needs to be NATed.My current config (excerpt) looks like this:Code:Select all/routing tableadddisabled=nofib name=guest/ip firewall mangleaddaction=mark-routing chain=prerouting comment=\"mark outbound guest traffic"dst-address=!192.168.180.0/24in-interface=\
    vlan.180.guestlog=yes log-prefix=guest|marknew-routing-mark=guest \
    passthrough=yesaddaction=mark-routing chain=preroutingin-interface=wg180 log=yes \
    log-prefix=wg180|innew-routing-mark=guest passthrough=yes/ip firewall nataddaction=masquerade chain=srcnat comment="masquerade wg180"log=yes \
    log-prefix=guest|masqout-interface=wg180 routing-mark=guest/ip routeadddisabled=nodst-address=0.0.0.0/0gateway=wg180 routing-table=guest \
    suppress-hw-offload=noadddisabled=nodistance=1dst-address=192.168.180.0/24gateway=\
    vlan.180.guestrouting-table=guest suppress-hw-offload=noI can see (using logging) that traffic from vlan.180.guest is marked, sent to wg180 and NATed, but I can't seem to spot any inbound traffic from wg180 after prerouting.Packets are received and correctly being identified as NATed, but never forwarded to vlan.180.guest:Code:Select all21:35:47firewall,info wg180|inprerouting:in:wg180out:(unknown0),connection-state:established,snat proto UDP,193.138.218.74:53->10.99.4.163:24815,NAT193.138.218.74:53->(10.99.4.163:24815->192.168.180.127:24815),len149Any ideas what I may be missing or where to continue troubleshooting?Thanks,Thilo

for real network separation as you described you should use VRFhttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ding+-+VRF

when you post the complete config I will reply/export file=anynameyouwish (minus router serial number, any public WANIP information, keys etc. )What you are asking should be easily done.  Did the third party server provide a specific DNS to use?@cracow, this is a normal setup for the MT going out third party VPN server, nothing overly complicated is required.
