This way, you have to make sure that there is no configuration on the new device (/system, reset configuration, no default config).If you want to have a clue what is happening, copy the rsc file line by line and paste it into a terminal.Make sure there are no MAC addresses in the commands.

You should have previewed rsc file to have things set and grouped in a proper order eg. WAN lists and bridges in advance to assign interfaces to them.Small tip (kudos to Rextended) is to export config with "terse" option as it exports all lines that are independend commands and you wouldn't be suprised that the command is not accepted as you have forgoten to change the context. Another bonus is that all lines are not wrapped with "\" at the end so copy+paste is easier.
