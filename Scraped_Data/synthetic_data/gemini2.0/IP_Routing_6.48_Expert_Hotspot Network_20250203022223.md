Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive MikroTik RouterOS configuration for IP routing, specifically focusing on your given parameters within a Hotspot Network context. This documentation will target RouterOS 6.48 (with general considerations for 7.x), and be at an Expert level. We will cover far more features than just the single parameter provided, which should help with future configurations.

# MikroTik RouterOS: IP Routing Configuration for Hotspot Network

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to configuring IP routing within a MikroTik router serving a Hotspot network, focusing on a specific subnet and interface. We will expand the configuration beyond the given parameters to provide a complete and robust solution.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** We are setting up a MikroTik router to serve as a gateway for a Hotspot network. This network will have a specific subnet, and we need to configure the router to handle routing for this subnet, DHCP, DNS, and other relevant services. We assume that this router is also acting as an access point and has an active internet connection on a different interface.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **Subnet:** 89.98.250.0/24 (256 IPv4 addresses, 89.98.250.1 - 89.98.250.254 usable addresses)
*   **Interface:** `wlan-31` (Assumed to be a wireless interface, but can be any interface type)
*   **DHCP Server:** Automatically assign IP addresses within the given subnet.
*   **DNS Server:** Resolve DNS requests.
*   **NAT:** Translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses for internet access.
*   **Firewall:** Basic protection against external threats and control traffic within the network.
*   **Security:** Ensure only authorized users can access the Hotspot.
*   **Routing:** Ensuring that routing for the provided subnet is correctly configured.
*   **Hotspot configuration:** basic configuration for the Hotspot functionality.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

We will primarily use the CLI for configuration, but we will indicate Winbox equivalents where relevant.

### Step 1: Interface Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/interface wireless
set wlan-31 disabled=no mode=ap-bridge ssid="Hotspot-SSID" band=2ghz-b/g/n channel-width=20mhz frequency=2437 country=us security-profile=default
/interface wireless security-profiles
set default mode=dynamic-keys authentication-types=wpa2-psk unicast-ciphers=aes-ccm group-ciphers=aes-ccm wpa2-pre-shared-key=YourSecurePassword
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `Wireless` > `Interfaces`.
*   Enable `wlan-31` (if necessary).
*   Double click `wlan-31` and configure its properties such as: Mode, SSID, Band, Country, etc.
*   Navigate to `Wireless` > `Security Profiles`.
*   Configure a security profile with WPA2-PSK and enter a strong password.
*   Select the security profile for your wireless interface.

**Explanation:**
*   We are enabling the `wlan-31` wireless interface and setting a basic SSID, channel, band, and security settings.  It's crucial to have a strong password set in the `wpa2-pre-shared-key` parameter.
*   For Hotspot setups you could also configure a MAC address server (described in another section) which makes it easy to manage access.

### Step 2: IP Address Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=89.98.250.1/24 interface=wlan-31
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` > `Addresses`.
*   Click `+` to add a new address.
*   Enter `89.98.250.1/24` for the address.
*   Select `wlan-31` for the interface.

**Explanation:**
*   We are assigning the IP address `89.98.250.1` to the `wlan-31` interface, which is the router's IP address within our subnet. This address acts as the default gateway for the subnet.
* The network address here is `89.98.250.0` and the broadcast address is `89.98.250.255`.
* You can confirm this through a terminal:
   ```
    [admin@MikroTik] > /ip address print
    Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
    #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
    0   89.98.250.1/24     89.98.250.0     wlan-31
    [admin@MikroTik] >
    ```

### Step 3: IP Pool Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=hotspot-pool ranges=89.98.250.2-89.98.250.254
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` > `Pool`.
*   Click `+` to add a new IP pool.
*   Enter `hotspot-pool` for the name.
*   Enter `89.98.250.2-89.98.250.254` for the ranges.

**Explanation:**
*   We are creating an IP pool named `hotspot-pool` that will be used by the DHCP server to assign IP addresses to clients in the range `89.98.250.2-89.98.250.254`.
*   It's important to keep the router's address out of the pool to avoid assigning the same address to other devices.

### Step 4: DHCP Server Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=wlan-31 lease-time=10m name=hotspot-dhcp
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=89.98.250.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=89.98.250.1
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` > `DHCP Server`.
*   Click `+` to add a new DHCP server.
*   Select `wlan-31` for the interface, set `hotspot-pool` for the address pool, and set the lease time.
*   Navigate to `IP` > `DHCP Server` > `Networks`
*   Add a new network address with `89.98.250.0/24` for the address, `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` as DNS servers and `89.98.250.1` as gateway

**Explanation:**
*   We are creating a DHCP server that will assign IP addresses from the `hotspot-pool` on the `wlan-31` interface.
*   The `lease-time` parameter sets how long an IP address is assigned before the DHCP client needs to renew.
*   We specify DNS server address(es) so the clients can resolve DNS. The gateway IP ensures the clients will route traffic to the router.
*   The DHCP server will only give IP address leases to devices on this subnet.

### Step 5: NAT Configuration (Assuming Internet Access on Another Interface e.g. `ether1`)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` > `Firewall` > `NAT`.
*   Click `+` to add a new NAT rule.
*   Set `chain=srcnat`, `action=masquerade`, and select your internet-facing interface (`ether1` or similar) in `out-interface`.

**Explanation:**
*   This is a basic source NAT (masquerade) rule that translates all traffic from the Hotspot network to the router's public IP on the internet interface (`ether1`).  Replace `ether1` with the interface connected to your internet source.
*   This ensures devices on the Hotspot network can access the internet.

### Step 6: Basic Firewall Configuration

**CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Accept established/related connections on input chain"
add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Accept ICMP on input chain"
add chain=input in-interface=wlan-31 action=drop comment="Drop all other input on wlan-31"
add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Accept established/related connections on forward chain"
add chain=forward in-interface=wlan-31 out-interface=!wlan-31 action=accept comment="Allow forward from wlan-31"
add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forwarding"
```

**Winbox:**
*   Navigate to `IP` > `Firewall` > `Filter Rules`
*   Add the above firewall rules.

**Explanation:**
*   These firewall rules provide basic protection.
    *   It accepts established and related connections, which allows traffic for connections initiated from your local network.
    *   It accepts ICMP packets (ping) to the router for diagnostics purposes.
    *   It blocks any other input traffic on the `wlan-31` interface, preventing unwanted access to the router from this network.
    *   It accepts forwarding for established/related connections.
    *   It accepts all forwarding from wlan-31 to other interfaces, allowing your Hotspot network to communicate outwards.
    *   It drops all other forwarding traffic, ensuring that the router is not used to forward traffic from other networks.
*   These rules provide essential protection and allow for basic traffic flow.

### Step 7: Basic Hotspot Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip hotspot
add address-pool=hotspot-pool disabled=no interface=wlan-31 name=hotspot1 profile=default
/ip hotspot profile
set default html-directory=flash/hotspot password-encryption=md5 transparent-proxy=no
/ip hotspot user profile
add name=default_users shared-users=unlimited
/ip hotspot user
add name=testuser password=testpass profile=default_users
```

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to `IP` > `Hotspot` > `Servers`, and add a new server with interface set to `wlan-31`, and profile set to `default`.
* Navigate to `IP` > `Hotspot` > `User Profiles` and modify the `default` profile as needed, and add a new user profile if needed.
* Navigate to `IP` > `Hotspot` > `Users` and add new users to be able to connect to the Hotspot network.

**Explanation:**
* This provides a basic Hotspot configuration where users need to log into the portal (in this case it is a default portal from RouterOS) before they can start surfing the web.
* We specify the `address-pool`, the interface, and set up a basic profile with an html directory, and create a test user for testing the functionality.
* A more complex portal can be uploaded to the router and specified in the Hotspot settings.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Firewall Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients can't connect to the internet or other devices in your network.
    *   **Solution:** Check firewall rules. Ensure the NAT rule is correctly configured and the forwarding rule to allow traffic from the interface is in place, and ensure that the out interface is correct. Use `torch` (described later) to check how the traffic is moving across interfaces.
    *   **Error Example:**
        *   **Command:** `/ip firewall filter print`
        *   **Observation:** Missing or incorrect NAT rule will result in no internet connectivity.
    *   **Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool torch interface=ether1 duration=10
        ```
        * **Observation:** If you are not seeing traffic on the interface that is connected to the internet, that may be an indication of an incorrect rule.

*   **DHCP Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients are not getting IP addresses.
    *   **Solution:** Verify DHCP server is enabled on the correct interface (`wlan-31`), and that there is an IP pool configured for the network. Also check the network configuration for the DHCP server. Ensure the address pool is correct in the DHCP server configuration. Also ensure that no other DHCP server is handing out addresses in the same subnet.
    *   **Error Example:**
        *   **Command:** `/ip dhcp-server print`
        *   **Observation:** Incorrect or missing `address-pool` or `interface` settings.
    *   **Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server lease print
        ```
        * **Observation:** Check the leases to see if there are any issues such as incorrect leases being handed out.

*   **Incorrect Wireless Settings:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients cannot connect to the wireless network.
    *   **Solution:** Verify SSID, security profile, password, band, frequency, and channel width.
    *   **Error Example:**
         *   **Command:** `/interface wireless print`
         *   **Observation:** Incorrect SSID or security profile configuration.

*   **Routing Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients can't reach specific networks, even with correct addresses
    *   **Solution:** Use `/ip route print` to check for missing or incorrect routes, and if necessary add a new route.
    *   **Error Example:**
        *   **Command:** `/ip route print`
        *   **Observation:** Missing or incorrect static routes.

*   **DNS Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients cannot resolve domain names
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the DNS servers are correct in the `/ip dhcp-server network` section.
    *   **Error Example:**
         *   **Command:** `/ip dhcp-server network print`
         *   **Observation:** Invalid DNS servers set.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

*   **Ping:**
    *   **Purpose:** Verify basic network connectivity.
    *   **From Router:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ping 8.8.8.8
        ```
    *   **From Client (Connected to the `wlan-31` Network):**
        ```bash
        ping 89.98.250.1
        ping 8.8.8.8
        ```
        * If either of these pings fail it could point to several problems.  If you can ping the router from a client, but not `8.8.8.8` it may be a routing issue, firewall issue or DNS issue.  If the client cannot ping the router, it may be an issue with the DHCP server or IP address configuration.

*   **Traceroute:**
    *   **Purpose:** Trace the path of packets to a destination.
    *   **From Router:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool traceroute 8.8.8.8
        ```
        * Use the trace to identify any bottlenecks or problems with routing.
    *  **From Client:**
       ```bash
        traceroute 8.8.8.8
       ```
        * Check the routing path to a remote host to verify it is passing through the router.

*   **Torch:**
    *   **Purpose:** Real-time packet monitoring.
    *   **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool torch interface=wlan-31
        ```
        * Shows real-time packet information passing through the interface. This is useful to verify if traffic is passing through an interface as expected.

*   **Packet Sniffer:**
    *   **Purpose:** Capture packets for analysis.
    *   **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool sniffer
        set file-name=capture.pcap
        start
        /tool sniffer print
        ```
        *   Capture packets and review them with Wireshark to identify more advanced problems.
    *   **Winbox:** Use `Tools` > `Packet Sniffer`.

*   **Log:**
    *   **Purpose:** View system logs for errors and events.
    *   **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /log print
        ```
    *   **Winbox:** Use `System` > `Logs`.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

### IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
*   MikroTik supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
*   IPv6 configurations are very similar to IPv4 configurations.
*   For IPv6 you use a colon instead of a period, and you can specify `::` to simplify the specification of addresses, such as `2001:db8::/32`
*   For example, to enable an IPv6 address on the same interface:
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address
    add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=wlan-31
    ```

### IP Pools
*   IP pools are dynamic ranges, and are used for the dynamic allocation of IP addresses.
*   IP Pools can also be used in firewall rules for example.

### IP Routing
*   MikroTik supports static and dynamic routing, including OSPF, RIP, BGP and others.
*   By default, the router will add a connected route when you set up an interface IP address.
*   You can add static routes to define specific paths for network traffic, or use the routing protocols if necessary.
*   Example of adding a route:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route
    add dst-address=192.168.100.0/24 gateway=192.168.1.2
    ```

### IP Settings
*   Contains general settings for IP forwarding and other related settings.
*   These are usually defaults, but you can adjust things like IPv6 forwarding, or the TCP/IP stack here.

### MAC Server
*   Used to manage MAC addresses, especially when you have a Hotspot setup.
*   Allows you to whitelist or blacklist MAC addresses.
*   Example, allow the MAC address `1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F`
    ```mikrotik
    /ip hotspot mac-address
    add mac-address=1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F
    ```

### RoMON
*   MikroTik's Router Management Overlay Network.

    ```

### User / User Groups
*   Manages users and user groups for authentication and access control.
*   You can limit access to different areas of the router based on user permissions.
*   You can add a new user with password `newpass` with group `full`:
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=newuser password=newpass group=full
    ```

### Bridging and Switching
*   Bridges multiple interfaces together to create a single layer 2 network.
*   Switching is used to forward traffic at layer 2
*   Example of creating a bridge interface between two ethernet interfaces
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge add name=mybridge
    /interface bridge port add bridge=mybridge interface=ether2
    /interface bridge port add bridge=mybridge interface=ether3
    ```

### MACVLAN
*   Creates multiple virtual interfaces on top of a single physical interface.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

MikroTik provides a basic REST API, though it might be less feature rich than other vendors. You will need to enable the API service, first (under IP -> Services), and then access it via the port specified. By default the API is enabled on port 8728, and you will need to add a user and give that user access to the API section. Let's assume we use user `apiuser` and password `apipassword`. This user will require the `api` and `read` permissions.

**Example 1: Get IP Address List**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Request Method:** GET
*   **Example Curl Command:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u apiuser:apipassword "https://<your-router-ip>:8728/ip/address"
    ```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    [
      {
        ".id": "*0",
        "address": "89.98.250.1/24",
        "interface": "wlan-31",
        "network": "89.98.250.0",
        "actual-interface": "wlan-31",
        "dynamic": "false",
        "disabled": "false"
      }
     ]
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This retrieves the list of IP addresses configured on the router. The `.id` value is important to update, delete and retrieve specific records.

**Example 2: Add a new IP Address**
*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "address": "192.168.1.100/24",
      "interface": "ether1"
    }
    ```
*   **Example Curl Command:**
    ```bash
   curl -k -u apiuser:apipassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address": "192.168.1.100/24","interface": "ether1"}' "https://<your-router-ip>:8728/ip/address"
    ```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
        {
            "message": "added"
        }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This adds a new address to the device

**Example 3: Delete an existing IP Address**
*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/address/<id>`
*   **Request Method:** DELETE
*  **Example Curl Command:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u apiuser:apipassword -X DELETE "https://<your-router-ip>:8728/ip/address/*1"
    ```
    * Remember to get the `id` from the first example.
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
        {
            "message": "removed"
        }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** This removes an address to the device. The `.id` needs to be replaced with the `id` for the record you would like to delete.

**Note:**

*   The RouterOS API is not fully RESTful. Many operations are executed by using the CLI command parameters.
*   You must enable the API service in `IP` > `Services` first.
*   Use HTTPS for security, and ensure the API user has sufficient access permissions.
*   The `curl -k` option is only for demonstration purposes and disables SSL verification. Do NOT use this in production!

## 8. In-Depth Explanation of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** Combines multiple interfaces into a single logical network. Data frames from one interface are passed to all other interfaces in the bridge, without regard to the IP address.
*   **Routing:** Directs network traffic between different networks. In RouterOS, routing is done by matching destination IP addresses with defined routes. The router is capable of acting as a router because it has more than one interface which are connected to different subnets. This routing is either manual, with static routes, or done via dynamic routing protocols. The router maintains a routing table.
*   **Firewall:** Controls network traffic based on rules. It works at layer 3, and filters packets based on IP addresses, ports, and connection states.  It also maintains a connection tracking table which is crucial for NAT and firewall decisions.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex and unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
*   **Disable Default Services:** Disable services you don't need.
*   **Secure API Access:** Use HTTPS and strong authentication for API access.
*   **Regular Software Updates:** Keep your RouterOS version up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Limit Access:** Restrict access to administrative interfaces to authorized IP addresses.
*   **Firewall:** Implement strict firewall rules for both input and forward chains.
*   **Wireless Security:** Use WPA2-PSK or WPA3 security with a strong passphrase.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Ports:** Ensure you disable any unused services, or disable ports on a firewall.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Review logs regularly for suspicious activities.

## 10.  Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples

*   Detailed examples for most of these topics were provided in section 6.

## Trade-offs

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:** Static routes are simpler to configure but less adaptable to network changes. Dynamic routing protocols are more complex but automatically adjust to network topology changes.
*   **NAT vs. No NAT:** NAT provides security by hiding internal IP addresses, but can make certain services difficult to configure. No NAT is easier for some applications, but it is generally less secure.
*   **Complex Firewall Rules:** More rules provide more granular control and security but can increase complexity and management overhead.
*   **QoS:** QoS can help prioritize critical traffic, but can also add latency, and it is difficult to do a good job with QoS rules.
*   **Hardware Offloading:** May improve performance, but may introduce bugs or cause other problems.
