Been hit by the known upgrade issue ... lost access now to remote CSS106. Warning should stay in this forum.2.17 disappeared  for CSS106 ?  NOW the site says : " version 2.16 for new RB260GS(CSS106-5G-1S), new RB260GSP(CSS106-1G-4P-1S)"

No serial port AFAIK. And no USB for Woobm serial.Device is more than 1200km from here. (There are 21 of those there.)I know that RB260 cannot make an IP outgoing connection (it does not do any IP routing, only responding on the same interface to the connecting MAC address).So what you see about upgrade in the web server of the RB260GSP is actually your PC collecting it from the internet, and framing it in that web-page.Once it worked (2.12->2.13) this year, then later it did not anymore. Now it failed again and the 2.17 is missing on the MT download website, but the upgrade page talked about 2.17.The unresponsive "CSS106-1G-4P-1S" is on version "SwOS 2.7" coming from 2.12, according to the "IP Neighbors Discovery" of RouterOS, the only responding request.Somebody local cut and restored the power on the network for me.Will not try this again, until the power supply is on an IP controlled power plug (Sonoff style - Switch ON and OFF)

Updated three CSS326-24G-2S+ and one CRS326-24G-2S+ without issue.As expected, no update available for my two CSS106 switches.
