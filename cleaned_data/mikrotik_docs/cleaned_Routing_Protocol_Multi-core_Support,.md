# Overview
RouterOS v7 is capable of splitting tasks between multiple processes.There is one "main" task, which can start/stop sub-tasks and process data between those sub-tasks. Each sub-task can allocate "private" (only accessible by this particular task) and "shared" memory (accessible by all route tasks).
List of tasks that run in separate processes (if multiprocess routing is enabled):
# BGP Sub-Tasks
BGP receive and send can be split into sub-tasks by specific parameters, for example, it is possible to run input per each peer or group all peer inputs and run them in the main process. This split by sub-tasks is controlled withinput.affinityandoutput.affinityparameter configuration in/routing/bgp/template.It is possible to boost performance by playing with affinity values on devices with fewer cores since sharing data between tasks is a bit slower than processing the same data within one task. For example, on single-core or two-core devices running input and output in the main or instance process will boost performance.
```
input.affinity
```
```
output.affinity
```
```
/routing/bgp/template
```
All currently used tasks and their allocated private/shared memory can be monitored using the command:
```
/routing/stats/process/print
```
Sample Output:
```
[admin@BGP_MUM] /routing/stats/process> print interval=1

# Routing Table Update Mechanism
Illustration below tries to explain in more user friendly form on how routing table update mechanism is working.
Routing protocols continuously loop through following procedures:
Consider "updated" and "current" as two copies of routing table, where "current" table (2) is the one used at the moment and "updated" (1) is table of candidate routes to be published in the next publish event (3 and 4). This method prevents protocols to fill memory with buffered updates while "main" process is doing "publish", instead protocols sends the newest update directly to "main" process which then copies new update in "updated" table. A bit more complicated is OSPF, it internally has similar process to select current OSPF routes which then are sent to theÂ  "main" for further processing.
