Okay, this is a massive undertaking. I will attempt to deliver a comprehensive document covering all aspects you requested with a focus on IP Addressing in a MikroTik ISP scenario while briefly touching on the other areas. Please note that providing full and exhaustive details for *every* section would result in a document of a truly enormous size, so I will aim for breadth and depth where it matters most while providing direction for the less critical topics.

## MikroTik RouterOS Expert Documentation: ISP Scenario

### 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Requirements

**Scenario:**

We are configuring a MikroTik router for an ISP providing internet services to multiple clients. The router acts as a gateway, performing routing, NAT, firewalling, and QoS. This setup will include both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **Routing:**
    *   Static routing for internal networks.
    *   Dynamic routing with BGP for peering with upstream providers.
    *   Policy-based routing for specific traffic.
*   **Addressing:**
    *   Public IPv4 address assigned to the WAN interface.
    *   Multiple private IPv4 networks for customer assignments.
    *   Public IPv6 prefix delegated by the upstream provider.
    *   IPv6 prefix delegation to customers.
*   **Firewall:**
    *   Protect the router from unauthorized access.
    *   Allow specific traffic based on IP addresses and ports.
    *   Implement NAT for IPv4 clients.
*   **QoS:**
    *   Control bandwidth usage for different types of traffic and customers.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   RADIUS authentication for client connections.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   Logging for security events and other relevant information.

### 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

Here's a breakdown of the implementation. Note that specific IP addresses and interface names should be replaced with your own setup.

**2.1. Basic Router Setup (CLI)**

*   **Setting the router's identity:**
    ```
    /system identity set name=isp-router
    ```

*   **Setting the admin password:**
    ```
    /user set admin password="your_strong_password"
    ```

*  **Disable default services**:
    ```
    /ip service disable telnet api api-ssl
    ```

**2.2. Interface Configuration**

We assume `ether1` connects to the upstream provider and `ether2` connects to your customer network.
* **Set up WAN interface**:
    ```
     /interface ethernet set ether1 name=wan
     /ip address add address=203.0.113.2/24 interface=wan
     /ip route add gateway=203.0.113.1
    ```

* **Set up customer facing interface**:
    ```
     /interface ethernet set ether2 name=lan
     /ip address add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=lan
    ```

*   **IPv6 Setup (Example):**

    ```
    /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8:1::1/64 interface=wan
    /ipv6 route add gateway=2001:db8:1::2
    /ipv6 dhcp-client add interface=wan request=prefix
    /ipv6 pool add name=customer-pool prefix=2001:db8:2::/48
    ```
**2.3. IP Addressing**
    * **IPv4 Addresses**
       * Already added to the interfaces above. Further customer specific IPv4 assignments would be via DHCP or static.

    * **IPv6 Addresses**
       * Already added to the interfaces above, a /48 prefix will be divided into /64 subnets for customer usage.

**2.4. IP Pools**

    * We will use the `customer-pool` for IPv6 customer delegation.
    * An IPv4 pool will be created for DHCP assignment.

    ```
    /ip pool add name=dhcp-pool ranges=192.168.10.100-192.168.10.200
    ```

**2.5. IP Routing**
   * **Static Routing**:
        * Default Route already created. More specific routing would be added as required.

   * **Dynamic Routing**
      * BGP example configuration:
    ```
    /routing bgp instance add name=default as=65000 router-id=10.0.0.1
    /routing bgp peer add instance=default name=upstream1 remote-address=203.0.113.3 remote-as=65001
    /routing bgp network add network=192.168.10.0/24 instance=default
    ```

**2.6. DHCP Server Setup (IPv4 and IPv6)**

*   **IPv4 DHCP Server:**

    ```
    /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp-pool interface=lan name=dhcp1
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.10.1
    ```
*   **IPv6 DHCP Server (prefix delegation):**

    ```
    /ipv6 dhcp-server add interface=lan name=dhcpv6-server
    /ipv6 dhcp-server network add address=::/0 dns-server=2001:4860:4860::8888,2001:4860:4860::8844 pool-name=customer-pool
    ```

**2.7. Firewall**

*   **Basic Firewall Rules (IPv4):**
    ```
    /ip firewall filter add chain=input action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow established and related connections"
    /ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Allow ICMP"
    /ip firewall filter add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop all other input"
    /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow established/related connections forward"
    /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forwarding"
    /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=wan comment="Masquerade traffic from the LAN to the WAN"
    ```
*   **Basic Firewall Rules (IPv6):**
    ```
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow established and related connections"
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input protocol=icmpv6 action=accept comment="Allow ICMPv6"
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop all other input"
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow established/related connections forward"
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forwarding"
    ```

**2.8. QoS (Simple Queues - Basic Example)**
```
/queue simple add name=customer1 target=192.168.10.0/24 max-limit=10M/10M
```

**2.9. RADIUS Configuration**
```
/ppp aaa set use-radius=yes
/radius add address=192.168.1.1 secret="your_radius_secret" service=ppp,dhcp,hotspot
```

**2.10. Winbox Equivalent**

These steps can also be configured using Winbox.  For instance, adding IP addresses involves navigating to: `IP -> Addresses`, configuring DHCP servers is under `IP -> DHCP Server`, etc. The Winbox GUI generally mirrors the CLI structure.

### 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

    *   Ping external IP addresses from the router (`/ping 8.8.8.8`).
    *   Ping internal IP addresses from the router and from client devices.
    *   Traceroute to external addresses (`/traceroute 8.8.8.8`).
*   **DHCP:**
    *   Ensure devices receive IP addresses from the DHCP server.
    *   Verify DNS settings passed to clients.
*   **IPv6:**
    *   Ping IPv6 addresses, both external and internal.
    *   Verify IPv6 prefix delegation to client devices.
*  **QoS:**
     * Use bandwidth test `/tool bandwidth-test` to verify configured bandwidth limits.
*  **Firewall:**
      * Test connectivity based on different firewall rules. Use the packet sniffer tool to observe the packet flow.

### 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik bridges combine network interfaces into a single layer 2 broadcast domain. All devices connected to a bridged interface share the same IP subnet and traffic is transparently passed between them.
*   **Routing:** Routing involves forwarding packets between networks.  MikroTik uses a routing table that contains information about where to send packets based on the destination IP address.
*   **Firewall:** MikroTik firewall is stateful; it tracks connection states and allows traffic based on these states, along with user-defined rules. It provides network security by inspecting packets.
*   **NAT:** Network address translation converts private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP.
*   **IP Pools:**  Used to manage and allocate blocks of IP addresses for DHCP servers or other services.

### 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Change Default Password:** Immediately change the default admin password.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services like `telnet`, `api`, `api-ssl` if not needed.
*   **Use Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
*   **Firewall Protection:** Implement a robust firewall and filter rules to protect the router from unauthorized access.
*   **HTTPS for Winbox/API:** Use HTTPS for Winbox access and MikroTik API access.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest version for security patches.
*   **Disable Guest Access:** Disable default guest user accounts.
*   **Audit Logs:** Regularly monitor log files for suspicious activity.
*   **Implement RBAC:** Use RouterOS user groups to assign least privileged user access.
*   **Use a Private VLAN for Management:** Isolate management traffic to a separate VLAN.
*   **Disable LLDP:**  If not required, disable LLDP to prevent information leakage.
*   **Use IP ACLs:** Add specific IP address to limit access to winbox or ssh.
*   **Limit API access:** Use specific firewall rules to limit API access to trusted hosts.
*   **Use RADIUS for Authentication:** Use RADIUS server to manage authentication and users.
