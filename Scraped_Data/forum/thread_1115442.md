I have tried doing a netinstall as follows:1. Press and hold reset button2. Insert power cable.3. Wait for flashing act light, continue to wait for On act light, continue to wait act light off.  then release reset button.I Already have netinstall running on linux machine which has an up (once power on) ethernet connection configured as 192.168.88.10/24 DFG as .1The netinstall just waits for RouterBoard.Running wireshark on the used ethernet I can see the routerboard sending Spanning packets and CDP packets I can also see Linux host sending IPv6 and other solicitain messages but no communicaiton with netinstall.I have tried all interfaces from the Internet one all the way along the board.Code:Select allnetinstall-7.16.2$sudo./netinstall-cli-r-i enp198s0f4u1 routeros-mipsbe-6.49.13.npkVersion:7.16.2(2024-11-2613:15:20)Willreset todefaultconfigWaitingforLink-UP on enp198s0f4u1Usingclient IP192.168.88.11WaitingforRouterBOARD...

You did use ether1 to connect your RB ?Sometimes it helps to put a dumb switch in between.

I have tried doing a netinstall as follows:Try earlier versions of net install.I think best choice is to use version of netinstall that corresponds to rb "current firmware".Helped me many times.Do not release button until you see device in netinstall gui.

Then you release the reset button. Sometimes observing light flashing pattern doesn't give you the right information.As far as the docs go, the only problem of holding button this long is that backup routerboot gets executed instead of the main one. But in my (limited) experience this is not really a problem, netinstall doesn't touch routerboot anyways, it's only necessary to get netinstall (or ROS) going. When device reboots after netinstall is done, it'll start main routerboot (unless you play with reset button while rebooting).
