Hello,I'm using my RouterBoard to connect to a wireless network. For example SSID: "network"There are multiple SSID's with the same name "network".The connection to the wireless network is working good.My questions is:Is it possible to specify the BSSID the MikroTik should connect to?Goal:I want the MikroTik to connect to a specific AccessPoint.Greetz,BluRay

It does not seem that people know the difference between a BSSiD and a SSiD...Not sure if the Wireless method mentioned above locks into aspecificBSSiD.However, moving on -Can someone advise on how to select aspecidicBSSiD using the newer WiFi package?

Deja Vu...I just needed to do this again.I googled keywords and ended up on this thread that I previously asked the same question...Is there no way to specify aspecific BSSiDwhen connecting a MikroTik in Station Bridge or Pseudobridge mode?

In principle it's possible to force device to connect to specific BSSID using ACL (in wifi/access-list) ... settingstation-roaming=notoconfigurationdoes help afterwards (so that station doesn't even consider roaming to another BSSID).
