Okay, let's dive into a detailed configuration for PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) using MikroTik RouterOS 7.11, focusing on a hotspot network scenario using the specified subnet and interface.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up a basic hotspot network on a MikroTik router. Users connecting to the hotspot will be authenticated using PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) with RADIUS server for AAA. This configuration will allow for centralized user management and accounting for hotspot access. We will use the `ether-7` interface as the hotspot’s interface, and clients will be assigned IP addresses from the `233.99.5.0/24` subnet.

## Implementation Steps:

**Detailed Explanation of Topic: PPP and AAA**

Before we jump into the configuration, let's briefly explain the components:
* **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):** A data link layer protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes.  In this case, it forms a link between the client and the MikroTik router.
* **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):** A security framework used to manage access to resources.
    * **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the user (e.g., using a username and password).
    * **Authorization:** Determines what the authenticated user is allowed to do.
    * **Accounting:** Tracks the user's resource consumption (e.g., time connected, data transferred).

In our scenario, the MikroTik router acts as the PPP endpoint, authenticating users against a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server. This allows for centralized user management.

**Step 1: Initial Router Check and Interface Configuration**

*   **Goal**: Ensure the target interface `ether-7` is configured, active, and doesn’t have conflicting configurations.

*   **Before**: Assume a basic MikroTik setup, no specific configurations on `ether-7`.

*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ethernet print
    ```

*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Interfaces` menu and review the list of interfaces.

*   **Expected Output**:  Review the output to ensure that `ether-7` exists. It should have a state of `enabled=yes` and potentially a `name`.

*   **Action:** If `ether-7` is disabled enable it. No ip address should be configured.

*   **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ethernet enable ether-7
    /ip address remove [find interface=ether-7]
    ```
*   **After**: `ether-7` is enabled and without IP configuration.

**Step 2: Create a Bridge Interface**
*  **Goal:** Create a bridge interface that `ether-7` will be associated with for PPP.
*  **Before:** No bridge interface is configured.
* **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge print
    ```
* **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Bridge` menu and view the `Bridges` tab.
* **Expected Output:** No bridge interface exists.
* **Action:** Create a bridge interface and add ether-7 to this bridge.
* **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
     /interface bridge add name=bridge-hotspot
     /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-hotspot interface=ether-7
     ```
*  **After**: `bridge-hotspot` bridge interface created with `ether-7` as a port.

**Step 3: Setup the IP Pool**

*   **Goal**:  Define the IP address pool from which PPP clients will receive IP addresses.
*   **Before**: No pool for the `233.99.5.0/24` subnet defined.

*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool print
    ```

*   **Winbox GUI**: Go to `IP` -> `Pools`.

*   **Expected Output**:  You should not see a pool that matches this subnet.
*   **Action**: Create a new IP pool that represents the desired IP address range.

*   **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=hotspot-pool ranges=233.99.5.2-233.99.5.254
    ```
    *   `name=hotspot-pool`:  A descriptive name for the IP pool.
    *   `ranges=233.99.5.2-233.99.5.254`: The available IP range for clients. We exclude the first and last addresses to avoid network and broadcast addresses.

*   **After**:  The `hotspot-pool` is defined.

**Step 4: Configure the PPP Profile**

*   **Goal**:  Create a PPP profile that defines the settings for PPP connections.

*   **Before**: No custom PPP profile configured for hotspot.

*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp profile print
    ```

*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `PPP` -> `Profiles`.

*   **Expected Output**: Shows the default PPP profile.

*   **Action:** Create a new PPP profile named "hotspot-profile".

*   **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp profile add name=hotspot-profile local-address=233.99.5.1 remote-address=hotspot-pool use-encryption=yes only-one=yes change-tcp-mss=yes
    ```
    *   `name=hotspot-profile`: The name for the PPP profile.
    *  `local-address=233.99.5.1`: Assign the router this ip address from the local pool.
    *   `remote-address=hotspot-pool`: The IP pool from which clients will get their IP addresses.
    *   `use-encryption=yes`: Enable encryption (MPPE) for security.
    *   `only-one=yes`: Restrict each user to a single connection.
    *   `change-tcp-mss=yes`:  Adjust the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) to help avoid packet fragmentation.

*   **After**: The `hotspot-profile` is available.

**Step 5: Configure RADIUS Server**

*  **Goal:** Configure RADIUS server for user authentication.

* **Before:** No RADIUS server is configured.

* **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /radius print
    ```
* **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Radius`.

* **Expected Output:**  No RADIUS server configuration exists.

* **Action:** Configure RADIUS server settings.

*   **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /radius add address=192.168.88.10 secret=secret123 service=ppp timeout=20ms
     ```
    * `address=192.168.88.10`: RADIUS server IP Address. You need to change this to your RADIUS Server address.
    * `secret=secret123`: Shared secret for RADIUS authentication.
    * `service=ppp`: Service for which this RADIUS config will be used
    * `timeout=20ms`: Timeout for RADIUS requests.

* **After:** RADIUS server information is set.

**Step 6:  Configure the PPP Secret for Local Testing (Optional)**

*  **Goal**: Configure a local PPP secret for initial testing, before using RADIUS.
*  **Before**: No local user for testing.
*  **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp secret print
    ```
* **Winbox GUI:** Go to `PPP` -> `Secrets`.
* **Expected Output:** No secrets configured.
* **Action:** Add a new user for testing.
*  **CLI Configuration:**
  ```mikrotik
  /ppp secret add name=testuser password=password123 service=ppp profile=hotspot-profile
  ```
   * `name=testuser`: The username for local test
   * `password=password123`: The password for local test
   * `service=ppp`: Service for which this secret will be used.
   * `profile=hotspot-profile`: The PPP profile to use for this user.
*  **After**: `testuser` secret configured.

**Step 7: Enable PPP Authentication Using RADIUS**

*   **Goal**: Enable RADIUS authentication for PPP and set the local profile.
*   **Before**: PPP is not configured to use RADIUS.

*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp aaa print
    ```

*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `PPP` -> `AAA`.

*   **Expected Output**: No configuration for use RADIUS server with ppp.

*   **Action:** Set PPP to use RADIUS for authentication.

*   **CLI Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp aaa set use-radius=yes accounting=yes interim-update=30s
    ```
    *   `use-radius=yes`: Enable RADIUS authentication.
    *   `accounting=yes`: Enable accounting for RADIUS.
    * `interim-update=30s`: How frequently the device will send accounting updates to RADIUS.

*  **After**: PPP AAA is configured to use RADIUS.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface ethernet enable ether-7
/ip address remove [find interface=ether-7]
/interface bridge add name=bridge-hotspot
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-hotspot interface=ether-7
/ip pool add name=hotspot-pool ranges=233.99.5.2-233.99.5.254
/ppp profile add name=hotspot-profile local-address=233.99.5.1 remote-address=hotspot-pool use-encryption=yes only-one=yes change-tcp-mss=yes
/radius add address=192.168.88.10 secret=secret123 service=ppp timeout=20ms
/ppp secret add name=testuser password=password123 service=ppp profile=hotspot-profile
/ppp aaa set use-radius=yes accounting=yes interim-update=30s
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** RADIUS authentication fails.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Verify that the RADIUS server IP address, shared secret, and service are correct on the MikroTik.
        *   Check logs on both the MikroTik (`/log print`) and the RADIUS server for errors.
        *   Use MikroTik's `/tool sniffer` to capture traffic between the router and RADIUS server for troubleshooting.
*   **Problem:** Clients cannot get IP addresses.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure that the IP pool is correctly configured and has enough IP addresses.
        *   Verify that the PPP profile is using the correct IP pool.
        *   Check if the client is actually sending the PPP authentication request.
*   **Problem:** High CPU usage.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Check the number of active users. If there are too many connections the MikroTik might be overloaded.
        *   Upgrade the device if needed.
        *   Review the router configuration. Check for firewall rules that could cause high CPU usage.
*   **Problem:** Firewall blocking traffic.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure that no firewall rules are blocking traffic between the PPP clients and the rest of the network.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Connect a test client to ether-7**: Ensure your client is configured to connect to the hotspot via PPPoE.
2.  **Authenticate with RADIUS or Local User**: After a successful authentication, your client should have a IP address in the range of 233.99.5.0/24.
3.  **Check the `/ppp active print` output**: Verify the client has an active PPP connection on the MikroTik.
4.  **Use `ping` to test connectivity**: Ping the gateway (233.99.5.1) and a destination on the internet to confirm the client is fully operational.
5.  **Check logs**: Review the logs for successful authentication and any errors on the MikroTik (`/log print`) and on the RADIUS server logs if applicable.
6.  **Monitor the `/system resource monitor`**: Ensure that the CPU is not overloading.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Hotspot Feature:** You can use the Hotspot feature in RouterOS to create a login page with user authentication. This feature can be used in addition to or instead of PPP.
*   **Traffic Shaping:** You can use MikroTik's Queue Tree system to control bandwidth usage on a per-user basis.
*   **Firewall Rules:** You can apply firewall rules to limit access to specific resources or ports.
*   **User Manager Package:** The user-manager package allows for more advanced user management.
*   **VPN:** Consider using VPN (PPTP, L2TP, or WireGuard) for more secure user connections.
*   **Advanced RADIUS:** Use RADIUS attributes to control authorization, such as time limitations, or bandwidth limits.
*   **DHCP:**  You can also use DHCP, assigning ip addresses to client directly on the bridge instead of using PPP.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While specific PPP session management is not directly available through the REST API, common parameters such as PPP profiles, RADIUS settings can be configured and managed with API calls.

Here is an example of how to add a new PPP profile via the API:

```bash
curl -k -u admin:your_admin_password -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST "https://your_mikrotik_ip/rest/ppp/profiles" \
-d '{
  "name": "new-hotspot-profile",
  "localAddress": "233.99.5.1",
  "remoteAddress": "hotspot-pool",
  "useEncryption": true,
    "onlyOne": true,
    "changeTcpMss": true
}'
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`-k`:** Allow insecure connections (not recommended for production).
*   **`-u admin:your_admin_password`:** Credentials to authenticate the API call. Change these to your username and password.
*   **`-H "Content-Type: application/json"`:** Set the content type.
*   **`-X POST`:** The method of this API call
*   **`https://your_mikrotik_ip/rest/ppp/profiles`:** API endpoint for creating PPP profiles.
*   **`-d '{...}'`:**  JSON payload containing the parameters.

**Expected Response:**
A successful response will have an HTTP status code 200 or 201, and return a JSON object with the information of the new object.
```json
{
  ".id": "*12",
  "name": "new-hotspot-profile",
  "localAddress": "233.99.5.1",
  "remoteAddress": "hotspot-pool",
  "useEncryption": true,
    "onlyOne": true,
    "changeTcpMss": true
}
```

If an error occurs the JSON response will contain the error description.
```json
{
  "message":"invalid value for argument 'address'"
}
```

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Strong RADIUS Secret:** Use a complex and lengthy shared secret for RADIUS.
*   **Encryption:** Always enable encryption in the PPP profile (MPPE or similar).
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement a strict firewall policy to protect the router.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS software updated to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Limit Access:** Restrict access to the router’s management interface.
*  **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS when accessing the RouterOS API.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

This configuration provides a functional, basic setup for a PPP-based hotspot. However, there are several areas for improvement:

*   **RADIUS Attributes:** The current setup only uses basic authentication; adding advanced RADIUS attributes for authorization and accounting would be beneficial. This allows more granular control.
*   **Hotspot Login Page:** Implement a customizable login page for a better user experience.
*   **Traffic Shaping:** Implement bandwidth limitations for each user, which is important for fair usage.
*   **Logging:** Implement better logging and monitoring to easily diagnose issues.
*  **More Secure Authentication:** Implement EAP-TLS to have a more secure authentication mechanism.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

* **PPP vs DHCP:** PPP (with PPPoE) offers per-user accounting and better control but adds overhead. DHCP is simpler to set up but doesn't offer the same per-user control.
* **RADIUS vs Local Secrets:** RADIUS allows centralized user management and more advanced control and logging, while local secrets are easier to set up for small deployments, but do not scale.
*   **Encryption:** Using encryption (like MPPE) will add processing load to the router but will offer better security.
* **IP Pool Size**: A larger IP pool can support more connections, but may cause more broadcast traffic, especially on bridged environments.
* **Interim Updates:** Frequent interim accounting updates can cause more traffic with RADIUS, and add load to the router.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:
This configuration targets RouterOS 7.11 and should be compatible with other 7.x versions and 6.48. However, be aware that some specific features may differ slightly between versions. For older RouterOS versions, you might find differences in the `/interface bridge` command, or PPP options. Always test in a lab environment before deploying to production. If you are using a version older than 6.48, some options might be unavailable, specially related to API calls, which were greatly improved after this version.
