Hi all,I'm trying to mount a usbstick using NFS from rose to a linux client (ubuntu 24.04):on routeros:- formated usb1 using ext4Code:Select all/disk/setusb1 nfs-sharing=yes[andreas@router-ddhome1]/disk>/disk/printFlags:B-BLOCK-DEVICE;M-MOUNTED;n-NFS-SHARINGColumns:SLOT,MODEL,SERIAL,INTERFACE,SIZE,FREE,FS,RAID-MASTER#     SLOT  MODEL                    SERIAL            INTERFACE                  SIZE           FREE  FS    RAID-MASTER0BMnusb1SanDiskU3CruzerMicro432433165750B307USB2.00480Mbps39139404803769630720ext4  none- mounting to linux client kind of works..Code:Select allroot@testbox2:~#mount-t nfs4192.168.105.1:/ /mnt/root@testbox2:~#ls-l/mnt/total4drwxrwxrwx3root root4096Dec621:53usb1

Anything in dmesg?If you create a file from the second ros and look at the uid of the file, does it show as 0?

Byexample from doc:nfs root directory should be content ofusb1, not root withusb1dir inside.mkdir /mnt/usb1mount -t nfs4 192.168.105.1:/ /mnt/usb1ls -l /mnt/usb1Edit: or not... (then it should not be possible to have multiple disks mounted over nfs)Did you try withCode:Select allmount-t nfs4192.168.105.1:/usb1 /mnt/usb1?Also check if files on disk are accessible in ROS and if TCP port 2049 is accessible from IP of device where mount is performed, from docs:NFS uses port TCP/2049. If the port is not available in disk print detail you will see the state stuck at  nfs-state="mounting"

Also check if files on disk are accessible in ROS and if TCP port 2049 is accessible from IP of device where mount is performed, from docs:NFS uses port TCP/2049. If the port is not available in disk print detail you will see the state stuck at  nfs-state="mounting"Seems you nailed it - I got to the manpage forexportsand it states that the default is to not allow mounting a device within an exported path.Code:Select allcrossmntThisoptionissimilar to nohide but it makes it possibleforclients to access all filesystems mounted on a filesystem markedwithcrossmnt.Thuswhena child filesystem"B"ismounted on a parent"A",setting crossmnt on"A"has a similar effect to setting"nohide"on B.Withnohide the child filesystem needs to be explicitly exported.Withcrossmnt it neednot.Ifa childofa crossmnt fileisnotexplicitly
          exported,thenit will be implicitly exportedwiththe sameexportoptionsasthe parent,exceptforfsid=.Thismakes it impossible  tonotexporta  childofa crossmnt filesystem.Ifsome butnotall subordinate filesystemsofa parent are to be exported,thenthey must be ex‐plicitly exportedandthe parent shouldnothave crossmntset.Thenocrossmnt option can explictly disable crossmntifit was previouslyset.Thisisrarely useful.

Try adding--verboseparam onmountcommand to see if any message appears that can be helpful for troubleshooting. Also try with adding-o sys=secparam tomountif error is related to security permissions, on most distributions this is default option.

If i used a just routed client everything works fine.Code:Select allroot@debian:/home/user# mount -t nfs4 192.168.105.1:/usb1 /mnt/root@debian:/home/user# ls -l /mnt/total404-rw-r--r--1root root393183Dec623:49cert-manager.yaml.16-rw-r--r--1root root3445Dec623:53default.yml
drwx------2root root16384Dec623:39lost+foundThis is fine for me. Thanks for your help!Andreas
