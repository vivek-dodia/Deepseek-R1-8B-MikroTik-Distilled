Okay, let's craft a detailed and practical guide to MikroTik user and user group management within the context you've provided. This will be geared towards a point-to-point link using RouterOS 7.12, focusing on advanced configurations.

## Scenario Description:

We will implement user management on a MikroTik router acting as an endpoint for a point-to-point link. Specifically, we will:

1.  Create user groups with defined permissions.
2.  Create users and assign them to specific groups, limiting their access and what they can do on the router.
3.  Apply these groups to management interfaces to restrict access to the router's configuration and ensure no unauthorized administration of the router.
4.  Verify the functionality using various MikroTik tools.
5. Provide API example calls for the setup.

The goal is to demonstrate the use of user management on the router connected via the `bridge-8` interface, which has been assigned the subnet of `229.239.148.0/24`. While the specific IP range is not directly related to the user management topic, it is the context we will be applying the user group restrictions to.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up users and user groups, providing examples of CLI commands and Winbox GUI interactions.

### Step 1: Create User Groups

*   **Description**:  We'll begin by defining two user groups: `readonly-group` and `admin-group`. The `readonly-group` will have limited access, while the `admin-group` will have full administrative privileges.
*   **CLI Before Configuration**:

    ```
    /user group print
    ```
    This command, executed before the creation of groups, will show an empty list or the default groups.

*   **CLI Configuration**:

    ```
    /user group add name=readonly-group policy=read
    /user group add name=admin-group policy=write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox
    ```

    *   `name`: Specifies the name of the user group.
    *   `policy`: Defines the access rights for the group. `read` allows read-only access, while a combination of `write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox` allows full administrative control, including the ability to modify and reset the router, change passwords and access the various router interfaces.

*   **Winbox GUI**:
    *   Navigate to `/Users/Groups`
    *   Click the `+` button, enter `readonly-group` as name and select `read` in `Policies` section.
    *   Click the `+` button, enter `admin-group` as name and enable all policies.

*   **CLI After Configuration**:

    ```
    /user group print
    ```

    The output should now show the two newly created groups:
    ```
    #   NAME         POLICY
    0   readonly-group read
    1   admin-group    write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox
    ```
*   **Effect**: This step creates the necessary groups for assigning permissions to users.

### Step 2: Create Users and Assign Them to Groups

*   **Description**: Now, we'll create two users: `readonly-user` and `admin-user`, and assign them to their respective groups.
*   **CLI Before Configuration**:
   ```
   /user print
   ```
    This command, executed before the creation of users, will show an empty list or the default users.
*  **CLI Configuration**:

    ```
    /user add name=readonly-user password=readonly-password group=readonly-group
    /user add name=admin-user password=admin-password group=admin-group
    ```
    *   `name`: Specifies the username.
    *   `password`: Sets the user's password.
    *   `group`: Assigns the user to a specific group.

    **Important Security Note:** Do not use weak passwords. Replace `readonly-password` and `admin-password` with strong, unique passwords in a real production environment.

*   **Winbox GUI**:
    *   Navigate to `/Users`.
    *   Click the `+` button, enter `readonly-user` as name, `readonly-password` as password, and select `readonly-group` in `Group` section.
    *   Click the `+` button, enter `admin-user` as name, `admin-password` as password, and select `admin-group` in `Group` section.
*   **CLI After Configuration**:

    ```
    /user print
    ```
    The output should now show the two new users:
    ```
    #   NAME         GROUP          DISABLED
    0   readonly-user readonly-group  no
    1   admin-user   admin-group  no
    ```
*   **Effect**: This step creates users with distinct access levels, ready to be used for logging into the router.

### Step 3: Apply User Groups to Management Interfaces

*   **Description**: We will now configure the `/ip service` entries to use the newly created user groups.

* **CLI Before Configuration**
    ```
    /ip service print
    ```
   This command will display the active services, with their current configurations, which probably will not be set up to use groups.
*   **CLI Configuration**:
    ```
    /ip service set telnet user-group=readonly-group
    /ip service set ssh user-group=admin-group
    /ip service set winbox user-group=admin-group
    ```
    *   These commands set the `user-group` parameter for the Telnet, SSH and Winbox services, which are the most common management interfaces.

*   **Winbox GUI**:
    *   Navigate to `/IP/Services`
    *   For the `telnet` service, select `readonly-group` as the value for `User Group`.
    *   For the `ssh` service, select `admin-group` as the value for `User Group`.
    *   For the `winbox` service, select `admin-group` as the value for `User Group`.

*   **CLI After Configuration**:

    ```
    /ip service print
    ```
    The output should display that the `user-group` parameters are updated for the `telnet`, `ssh` and `winbox` services. For example:
    ```
    #   NAME       PORT  ADDRESS        CERTIFICATE  USER GROUP
    0   telnet      23                none        readonly-group
    1   ftp         21                none
    2   www         80                none
    3   ssh         22                none        admin-group
    4   www-ssl    443                none
    5   winbox     8291                none        admin-group
    ```
*  **Effect**: This limits access to each interface, meaning that logging in to Telnet with `admin-user` will not work, but logging in to SSH or Winbox using that user will work, and vice-versa.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```
/user group
add name=readonly-group policy=read
add name=admin-group policy=write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox
/user
add name=readonly-user password=readonly-password group=readonly-group
add name=admin-user password=admin-password group=admin-group
/ip service
set telnet user-group=readonly-group
set ssh user-group=admin-group
set winbox user-group=admin-group
```

| `/ip service set` | `name`     | The name of the service that will be configured.                                                                     | `telnet`, `ssh`, `winbox`         |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** Forgetting user's password, or creating a weak password.
    *   **Solution:** Reset password via `/user set <username> password=<new-password>`. It's recommended to implement a good password policy for your network.
*   **Problem:** Assigning incorrect policies to the user group (e.g., read-only users needing write access).
    *   **Solution:**  Adjust group policy using `/user group set <groupname> policy=<new-policy>`.
*   **Problem:** Locking yourself out of the router.
    *   **Solution:** If you make changes to SSH/Winbox access that prevents you from accessing the router, you can attempt to use the web console interface (if enabled) or use the serial console. Another way could be to use the Netinstall tool to re-install the router and start from scratch, ensuring all your scripts are correct.
*  **Problem:** High CPU or memory usage due to excessive logging of user access.
    *   **Solution:** Review log settings in `/system logging` and adjust the log levels. Ensure you only log the required data to prevent overlogging and high resource usage.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Telnet Test**: Try logging in to the router using `telnet <router-ip>`. Attempt with `readonly-user` and `admin-user`.  `readonly-user` should login, and `admin-user` should not be able to log in.

    ```
    telnet 229.239.148.x
    login: readonly-user
    password: readonly-password
    ```
2.  **SSH Test**: Attempt to connect via SSH using both users.
    ```
    ssh readonly-user@229.239.148.x
    ssh admin-user@229.239.148.x
    ```
    `readonly-user` should not be able to login, but `admin-user` should.
3.  **Winbox Test**: Try logging in to Winbox with both user names. `readonly-user` should not be able to log in, and `admin-user` should log in.
4.  **`system user print` Test**: Log in with either user and run `system user print` and verify if the user can view the other users. `readonly-user` will not be able to see other users, but `admin-user` will.
5.  **Policy Test**: Log in as `readonly-user` using Telnet, and try to change the IP address using the command `/ip address add address=10.0.0.1/24 interface=ether1`. The router will return an `access denied` error.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Radius Server**: For larger environments, consider using a RADIUS server for centralized user authentication.
*   **User Profiles**: You can assign profiles to users for finer-grained control of access to specific features (beyond just read/write).
*   **API Access**: Control access to the RouterOS API by using the user groups as well.
*   **Resource limits**: If users are created that are running scripts, limit their resource limits using the `/user resource` section of the configuration.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

**Note:** Before running this commands, enable the API service in `/ip service` and enable user access by configuring the API user.

### Create User Group

*   **API Endpoint**: `/user/group`
*   **Request Method**: POST
*   **Example JSON Payload**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "readonly-group",
      "policy": "read"
    }
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "name": "admin-group",
      "policy": "write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
     {
         ".id": "*1",
         "name": "readonly-group",
         "policy": "read"
      }
    ```
   ```json
    {
       ".id": "*2",
        "name": "admin-group",
        "policy": "write,test,password,reboot,policy,ftp,web,local,winbox"
    }
    ```

### Create User

       "address": "",
       "certificate": "none",
        "user-group": "admin-group"
     }
    ```
**Error Handling**: Check the HTTP status code and the body of the response. A `400 Bad Request` usually means the request is malformed. A `403 Forbidden` means your API user does not have the permissions to execute the request.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Limit Access:** Only grant necessary permissions to users. Avoid giving full access unless absolutely required.
*   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review user permissions and remove accounts that are no longer needed.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** If you are not using the services, disable them in `/ip service`.
*   **Secure API Access**: Always protect the MikroTik API by using a secure user with very limited privileges and always use a https connection.
*   **Regular RouterOS Updates**: Update RouterOS to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall**: Ensure you have a basic firewall in place that protects the router.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Dynamic Groups:** For larger setups, using a RADIUS server would allow dynamic assignment of user groups, instead of static assignments.
*  **Automation:** This can be improved by using a scripting language to automate the user creation process or API calls.
*  **More granular permissions**: The setup can be improved by using user profiles, allowing more granular access control over various resources.
* **Logging**: Implement proper logging of user access, and ensure these logs are sent to an external server for future auditing.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic

In MikroTik RouterOS, user management is crucial for securing your router. You can create users with different access levels and assign them to specific user groups, limiting their permissions and access to various resources and services on the device. This concept is vital in environments with multiple administrators or when giving limited access to outside personnel. The granularity of the access is also important when you need to keep certain users from modifying configurations that could harm the network or disrupt the service provided by the router. User management ensures that only authorized personnel can interact with critical functions of the device.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Simple User Management vs. Radius:** Using local user accounts is easy to set up and good for small networks. However, for large setups, using Radius allows centralized user management, better scalability, and dynamic policy assignment. Radius also allows the usage of Multi-Factor Authentication.
*   **Read-Only vs. Full Access:** Read-only users can monitor the router without the risk of accidental misconfigurations. While this enhances security, it can be a problem when an administrator requires access to change or modify the configurations of the router. You should always give the least access required.
*   **Winbox Access**: Providing Winbox access allows a graphical interface that is easier for most people to use. However, it may be a security risk when the connection is not secure. If the Winbox port is open, you should ensure you are only allowing connections from trusted networks.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions

The commands and parameters used are valid for RouterOS 7.12, as well as other 7.x versions, and also for legacy versions of RouterOS 6.48.

This comprehensive documentation should enable you to effectively manage users and user groups on your MikroTik Router, enhancing both the security and manageability of your network. Let me know if you have more questions.
