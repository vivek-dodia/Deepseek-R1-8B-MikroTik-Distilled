Hello,I already have a wireless network with a Capsman system and 56 Cap AC access points. They work well, but I bought 15 more cAP AX access points this year and they're not joining the Capsman.Can anyone help me with connecting the new ones while keeping the old ones connected?My switch router model is: CCR1036-8G-2S+Thanks in advance.

Your cap AC are most likely using "old" capsman.You need to use wave2 capsman for AX devices, completely separate menu structure.Good thing: you can have both capsman environments on the same controller but you need to be running at least ROS 7.13.See here for more info:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/WirelessHint: those cAP ACs can theoretically be upgraded to use wave2 drivers as well but beware before you begin.There are quite some important caveats if you rely on VLANs being assigned to various wifi SSIDs (which is mostly manual work for now, if you go down that road).

On theWiFitab, on theradiostab, or somewhere else?I reinstalled ROS to version 7.15.3, which removed all my setups. I set it up again, but now it doesn't show the 2.4G Wi-Fi with the AX cAP's. Previously, I set up a total of 4 Wi-Fi networks - with the old capsman, I set up 2.4 and 5G, and with AX cAP's (wi-fi interface), I also set up 2.4 and 5G. But now, it's not showing my 2.4 channels with the AX cAPs.Screenshot 2024-08-03 164232.png

You have again posted just the screenshot, without the output of the/interface/wifi/exportcommand, although the wifi-related configuration is different from the one you have posted before (at least because 7.16 has a different set of parameters than 7.15.3).

On theWiFitab, on theradiostab, or somewhere else?Most likely DFS frequency gets selected (AX devices seem to favor those ranges).Again a reason why I NEVER set frequency selection to auto.I always choose which frequency to use so I know what it should be.

What is the correct decision: to use AC and AX caps in the Wi-Fi section? Or AC caps with the old CAPsMAN and AX CAPs with the Wi-Fi option?It depends on your preferences. If dynamic assignment of SSIDs and users into VLANs is a must, you have to use thewirelesspackage on the ac devices (and control them using the corresponding CAPsMAN). If you don't, you can use thewifi-qcom-acpackage on the ac devices, somewhat improving coverage and benefiting from the assisted roaming functionalities.

In some environments the WiFi users use individual credentials (it is called WPAx-enterprise authentication), so the RADIUS server can inform the wireless network not only about success or failure of the authentication but also to which VLAN to connect the user. So instead of having a dedicated SSID for each category of users, you can use a single one and use the individual credentials to control their connection.On a lower level, the WiFi CAPsMAN can specify a VLAN ID as a datapath parameter; this also only works with the ax devices whereas for the ac devices running wifi-qcom-ac, you have to set the VLAN tag for a wifi interface manually, by means of bridge port configuration.
