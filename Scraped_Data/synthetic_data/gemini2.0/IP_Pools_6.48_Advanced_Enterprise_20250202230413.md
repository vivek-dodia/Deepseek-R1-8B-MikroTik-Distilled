1. **Configuration scenario and requirements**

   - Configure an IP pool with a range of IPv4 addresses to be assigned to clients via DHCP.
   - Ensure that the pool is created on the correct interface and subnet.
   - Verify that the DHCP server is running and configured to use the IP pool.

2. **Step-by-step implementation**

   1. Connect to the RouterOS device using WinBox or the command line.
   2. Navigate to **IP > Pools** in the WinBox GUI or type the following command in the CLI:

      ```
      /ip pool
      ```

   3. Click on the **+** button to create a new pool.
   4. Enter the following parameters in the "IP Pool" window:

      - **Name:** A descriptive name for the pool.
      - **Ranges:** The range of IP addresses that will be assigned from the pool.
      - **Next Pool:** The next pool to use if this pool is exhausted.
      - **Comment:** An optional comment to describe the pool's purpose.

   5. Click on the **OK** button to create the pool.
   6. Navigate to **IP > DHCP Server** in the WinBox GUI or type the following command in the CLI:

      ```
      /ip dhcp-server
      ```

   7. Click on the **Leases** tab in the "DHCP Server" window.
   8. Click on the **+** button to create a new lease.
   9. Enter the following parameters in the "DHCP Lease" window:

      - **Interface:** The interface on which the lease will be assigned.
      - **Address Pool:** The IP pool from which the address will be assigned.
      - **MAC Address:** The MAC address of the client that will be assigned the address (optional).
      - **Comment:** An optional comment to describe the lease.

   10. Click on the **OK** button to create the lease.

3. **Complete configuration commands**

   The following commands can be used to create an IP pool and assign it to a DHCP server lease:

   ```
   /ip pool
   add name=pool1 ranges=192.168.1.10-192.168.1.20 comment="DHCP pool for LAN"
   
   /ip dhcp-server
   add interface=ether1 address-pool=pool1 lease-time=86400 comment="DHCP server for LAN"
   ```

4. **Common pitfalls and solutions**

   - **Incorrect IP pool range:** Ensure that the IP pool range does not overlap with any other IP pools or subnets on the network.
   - **DHCP server not running:** Verify that the DHCP server is running and listening on the correct interface.
   - **Client not receiving IP address:** Check that the client's network settings are configured to obtain an IP address via DHCP.

5. **Verification and testing steps**

   - Use the following command to verify that the IP pool has been created:

      ```
      /ip pool
      print
      ```

   - Use the following command to verify that the DHCP lease has been created:

      ```
      /ip dhcp-server lease
      print
      ```

   - Connect a client to the network and verify that it receives an IP address from the DHCP pool.

6. **Related features and considerations**

   - **IP Address Management:** IP pools are an essential component of IP address management in RouterOS. They allow you to centrally manage and assign IP addresses to clients on your network.
   - **DHCP Server:** DHCP servers rely on IP pools to assign IP addresses to clients. Configuring an IP pool is a prerequisite for setting up a DHCP server.
   - **Network Security:** IP pools can be used to implement network security measures, such as restricting access to certain IP addresses or subnets.

7. **MikroTik REST API examples**

   **Endpoint:** `/api/ip/pool`

   **Request method:** GET

   **Example JSON payload:**

   ```
   {
      "interface": "ether1",
      "address-pool": "pool1",
      "lease-time": 3600
   }
   ```

   **Expected response:**

   ```
   [
      {
         "interface": "ether1",
         "address-pool": "pool1",
         "lease-time": 3600,
         "created": "2023-03-08T15:34:17Z"
      }
   ]
