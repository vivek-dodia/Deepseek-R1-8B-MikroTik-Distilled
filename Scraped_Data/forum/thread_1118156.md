Hi,what does this checkbox?Screenshot 2024-09-28 223330.jpgIf on or not, the Interface shows up with the comment "added by vlan on bridge":Screenshot 2024-09-28 223459.jpgThe documentation reads:mvrp (yes | no; Default: no)Specifies whether this VLAN should declare its attributes through Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) as an applicant. It can be used to register the VLAN with connected bridges that support MVRP.  This property only has an effect when use-service-tag is disabled.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/VLANhttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... ching-MVRPBut is this not obsolete with the dynamic addition from v7.16 on:*) bridge - added dynamic tagged entry when VLAN interface is created on vlan-filtering bridge;If checkbox is off, VLAN99 in this case, shows up dynamically on other bridges (with MVRP comment):Screenshot 2024-09-28 224707.jpgIf the VLAN99-interface is not bound to the bridge, is shows never up - regardless of the state of the checkbox... If I understand MVRP correctly, the VLAN interface should be added dynamically but the MVRP propagation should only happen when checkbox is on?!

Mikrotik seems to have improved the description of the tag, even if just a little bit. It currently reads:Specifies whether this VLAN should declare its attributes through Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) as an applicant. Its main use case is for VLANs that is created on Ethernet interface (such as a "router on a stick" setup) that is connected to a bridge supporting MVRP. Enabling this option on a VLAN interface that is already part of an MVRP-enabled bridge has no effect, as the bridge manages MVRP in that case. This property only has an effect when use-service-tag is disabled.What I personally found a bit confusing at first is the expression "connected to a bridge". In context, however, it becomes clear that this bridge is part of another device, not of the same device.So, in your router, you have to create the vlan interfaces on top of a single, separate ethernet interface which is physically connected to another switch. In other words, we're talking about the trunk port. If you turn on MVRP on these VLAN interfaces, andalsoturn on MVRP on the bridge of the connected switch, the respective VLANs should show up in the VLAN table as tagged.

Well the text is confusing.  But so is the RouterOS bridge interface... see @sindy's "RouerOS bridging mysteries explained", which pre-dates MVRP and dynamic /interface/bridge/vlan assignments:viewtopic.php?t=173692In 7.16 and above, /interface/vlan (i.e. dynamic config added automatically by RouterOS) has some helpers to set tagged=bridge for the VLAN in /interface/bridge/vlans, IF /interface/vlan's interface= is set to a bridge interface (and it was not already manually configured).  But this logic is independent of MVRP checkbox on the /interface/vlan - although BOTH dynamic tagged=bridge for each /interface/vlan & MVRP came in 7.16 so this appear more related than the are.  But agree the MVRP text is better but still confusing since its lot words to say LOCAL bridge interface's MVRP setting that "win" & MVRP checkbox apply to cases where interface=<ethernet port>.

In 7.16 and above, /interface/vlan (i.e. dynamic config added automatically by RouterOS) has some helpers to set tagged=bridge for the VLAN in /interface/bridge/vlans, IF /interface/vlan's interface= is set to a bridge interfaceI made my first experiments with VLAN on Mikrotik this week and I found it very helpful, intuitive even that the bridge interface is automatically marked as tagged for VLAN interfaces based on the bridge interface. Good to know that this is a new feature and wasn't present before 7.16.
