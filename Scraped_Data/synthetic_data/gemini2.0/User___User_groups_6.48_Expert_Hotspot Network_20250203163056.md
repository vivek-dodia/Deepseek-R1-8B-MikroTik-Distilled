Okay, let's craft some comprehensive documentation for managing users and user groups in a MikroTik Hotspot network, specifically using RouterOS 6.48 and targeting an expert configuration level.

## Scenario Description:

We are configuring a MikroTik router for a hotspot network within a small business environment. The network is using the 220.159.183.0/24 subnet, and the primary network interface is connected to a bridge named "bridge-92". We aim to implement user authentication and authorization using user groups, allowing for different access levels and potential rate limiting for users.

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. Step 1: Initial Interface and Addressing Setup

*   **Description:**  Before setting up users and user groups, itâ€™s vital to have the basic network configuration in place. This includes defining the interface, the IP address on the interface, and basic network connectivity.

*   **Before Configuration:** Assume bridge-92 exists and may or may not have an IP address.
    *   In Winbox: Interfaces listed, but without address.
    *   In CLI: Basic interface configurations may be present, but without an address.

*   **Configuration:** Add an IP address to interface `bridge-92`.

    *   **CLI:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address add address=220.159.183.1/24 interface=bridge-92
        ```
        *   `address=220.159.183.1/24`: Specifies the IPv4 address and subnet mask to be assigned.
        *   `interface=bridge-92`: The interface this address is assigned to.
    *   **Winbox:**
        *   Go to `IP` -> `Addresses` -> `+`
        *   Address: `220.159.183.1/24`
        *   Interface: `bridge-92`
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`

*   **After Configuration:** `bridge-92` has a valid IP Address.
    *   In Winbox: Interface `bridge-92` shows the assigned address.
    *   In CLI: `/ip address print` shows an entry with our address.

*   **Effect:** The router's interface `bridge-92` now has an IP address within the defined subnet, allowing communication on that network.

### 2. Step 2: Create User Groups

*   **Description:**  Define user groups to enable differentiated access control.

*   **Before Configuration:** No user groups are defined.
    * In Winbox: No user groups listed.
    * In CLI: `/user group print` shows default groups only

*   **Configuration:** We'll create two groups: "standard" and "premium".
    *   **CLI:**
        ```mikrotik
        /user group add name=standard
        /user group add name=premium
        ```
        *   `name=standard`: Creates the group named "standard".
        *   `name=premium`: Creates the group named "premium".
    *   **Winbox:**
        *   Go to `System` -> `Users` -> `User Groups` -> `+`
        *   Name: `standard`
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`
        *   Repeat for `premium`

*   **After Configuration:** The user groups "standard" and "premium" are created.
     * In Winbox: "standard" and "premium" groups are listed.
     * In CLI: `/user group print` shows the new groups.

*   **Effect:** Two user groups are available for assigning users.

### 3. Step 3: Create Users and Assign them to User Groups

*   **Description:**  Create user accounts and assign them to the appropriate user groups.

*   **Before Configuration:**  No user accounts exist (beyond admin).
    *   In Winbox: Only default user(s) are listed.
    *   In CLI: `/user print` shows default users only.

*   **Configuration:** Create two new users: "user1" (standard) and "user2" (premium).
    *   **CLI:**
        ```mikrotik
        /user add name=user1 password=password1 group=standard
        /user add name=user2 password=password2 group=premium
        ```
        *   `name=user1`: Username is "user1".
        *   `password=password1`: Password for "user1". **Note: Use strong passwords in production.**
        *   `group=standard`: Assign user to the "standard" group.
         * `name=user2`: Username is "user2".
        *   `password=password2`: Password for "user2". **Note: Use strong passwords in production.**
        *   `group=premium`: Assign user to the "premium" group.
    *   **Winbox:**
         *  Go to `System` -> `Users` -> `+`
         *  Name: `user1`
         *  Group: `standard`
         *  Password: `password1`
         *  Click `Apply` then `OK`
         *  Repeat for `user2` with group `premium` and `password2`

*   **After Configuration:** Two new user accounts exist and assigned to groups.
    * In Winbox: New user accounts are listed, showing the group.
    * In CLI: `/user print` shows the new users and their groups.

*   **Effect:** Users are created and assigned to appropriate groups for access control.

### 4. Step 4: Implement basic Hotspot Configuration

*   **Description:** Set up a simple hotspot server on bridge-92.

*   **Before Configuration:** No Hotspot server configured on bridge-92.
    * In Winbox: No Hotspot servers listed.
    * In CLI: `/ip hotspot print` shows nothing configured yet

*   **Configuration:**
    * **CLI:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip hotspot add name=hotspot-bridge-92 interface=bridge-92 address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92 profile=default
        /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92 interface=bridge-92 disabled=no
        /ip hotspot profile set default use-radius=no
        ```
        *   `/ip hotspot add`: Enables a hotspot server.
            *   `name=hotspot-bridge-92`: The name of this hotspot server
            *   `interface=bridge-92`: The interface for the hotspot.
            *   `address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92` : Uses the dhcp address pool
             *  `profile=default`: The profile to use
        *   `/ip dhcp-server add` : Adds a dhcp server
             *   `address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92`: Assigns the address pool
             *  `interface=bridge-92`: The interface for dhcp.
             * `disabled=no` : Enables the DHCP server
         *   `/ip hotspot profile set default use-radius=no`: Disables RADIUS server for hotspot testing.
    *   **Winbox:**
        *   Go to `IP` -> `Hotspot` -> `Servers` -> `+`
        *   Name: `hotspot-bridge-92`
        *   Interface: `bridge-92`
        *   Address Pool: create new pool and add appropriate range for this subnet
        *   Profile: `default`
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`
        *   Go to `IP` -> `DHCP Server` -> `DHCP` -> `+`
        *   Name: `dhcp-bridge-92`
        *   Interface: `bridge-92`
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`

*   **After Configuration:** A basic hotspot is up and running.
    * In Winbox: A hotspot server for `bridge-92` is listed.
    * In CLI: `/ip hotspot print` shows the hotspot server configuration.

*   **Effect:** Users can now connect to the hotspot but are not yet limited or authenticated based on group.

### 5. Step 5: User Group based limitations (Example - simple rate limiting)

*   **Description:**  Add rate limiting based on the user groups to differentiate the bandwidth available for "standard" and "premium" users.

*   **Before Configuration:**  No user group based limitations are in effect
    * In Winbox: No rate limits by groups configured.
    * In CLI: No rate limiting in place.

*   **Configuration:** Apply a simple rate limit (1Mbps download/upload for `standard`, 5Mbps for `premium` users). This will be applied through the hotspot profile.
    *   **CLI:**
        ```mikrotik
       /ip hotspot profile set default rate-limit=1M/1M
       /ip hotspot user group add name=standard shared-users=1 rate-limit=1M/1M
       /ip hotspot user group add name=premium shared-users=1 rate-limit=5M/5M
        ```
      *   `rate-limit=1M/1M`: Set the default rate for users to 1Mbps download/upload for the default hotspot profile.
      *   `/ip hotspot user group add name=standard shared-users=1 rate-limit=1M/1M` : Adds the standard group with rate limits for hotspot users.
      *   `/ip hotspot user group add name=premium shared-users=1 rate-limit=5M/5M`: Adds the premium group with rate limits for hotspot users.
    *   **Winbox:**
        * Go to `IP` -> `Hotspot` -> `User Groups` -> `+`
        *   Name: `standard`
        *   Shared Users: `1`
        *   Rate Limit: `1M/1M`
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`
        *  Repeat the same steps with `premium` group, `shared-users` set to 1 and `Rate Limit` set to `5M/5M`

*   **After Configuration:** User groups are configured with specific rate limits
    * In Winbox: User groups are listed in hotspot settings.
    * In CLI: `/ip hotspot user group print` shows the configuration.

*   **Effect:**  Users in the "standard" group will be limited to 1Mbps up/down, while "premium" users will have a limit of 5Mbps up/down.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/ip address add address=220.159.183.1/24 interface=bridge-92
/user group add name=standard
/user group add name=premium
/user add name=user1 password=password1 group=standard
/user add name=user2 password=password2 group=premium
/ip hotspot add name=hotspot-bridge-92 interface=bridge-92 address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92 profile=default
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool_bridge_92 interface=bridge-92 disabled=no
/ip hotspot profile set default use-radius=no
/ip hotspot profile set default rate-limit=1M/1M
/ip hotspot user group add name=standard shared-users=1 rate-limit=1M/1M
/ip hotspot user group add name=premium shared-users=1 rate-limit=5M/5M
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Incorrect Interface:** Assigning the hotspot to the wrong interface will prevent users from connecting.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the `interface` parameter in the `/ip hotspot add` command. Use `/interface print` to ensure you are using the correct name.
*   **Incorrect Subnet:** Assigning IP addresses outside the correct network may cause connection issues.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the subnet mask in `/ip address add` and ensure the DHCP server provides addresses in the same range. Use `/ip address print` to see current configurations.
*   **Weak Passwords:** Using simple passwords makes accounts vulnerable.
    *   **Solution:** Enforce strong password policies and educate users on best practices. Implement RADIUS authentication where possible.
*   **Missing DHCP Configuration:** If the DHCP server isn't configured, connected clients won't receive IP addresses.
    *   **Solution:**  Make sure `/ip dhcp-server add` command is correctly set. Also, ensure the interface is active with no issues. Use the command `/ip dhcp-server print` to see the dhcp settings.
*   **Incorrect User Group Assignment:** Not assigning users to the correct groups will result in unintended access or limits.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the `group` parameter in the `/user add` command and ensure they are in the correct `hotspot user group`. Use `/user print` to check current settings.
*   **High CPU usage:** If you are using hotspot features, you may see high CPU usage, especially if you do not have a strong CPU in your router.
    *  **Solution:** Consider using hardware offloading if possible. Review other rules that may be adding load to the CPU (NAT rules, queue rules). Consider implementing less CPU intensive functions, such as using a radius server.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Connect a Client:** Connect a device to the `bridge-92` network (Wi-Fi or wired) and observe that it receives an IP address.
2.  **Hotspot Login:** Open a web browser on the client, you should be redirected to the hotspot login page. Log in with "user1" and password "password1".
3.  **Test Rate Limits (user1):** Perform a speed test and verify a maximum speed around 1Mbps.
4.  **Login with another user (user2):**  Logout and login as user2 with the password password2.
5.  **Test Rate Limits (user2):**  Repeat a speed test. Ensure user2 has an approximate limit of 5Mbps.
6.  **User List:** In Winbox, go to `IP` -> `Hotspot` -> `Active` to see who is logged on. In the CLI, use `/ip hotspot active print`. This list will show logged on users and their IP addresses.
7. **Ping:** Ping the router address from an attached client to test connectivity. From the client open the CLI (Windows: cmd, Linux/Mac: terminal) and type `ping 220.159.183.1`.
8. **Torch:** Use torch to verify the rate limits. From the router console use `/tool torch interface=bridge-92`.  You can see the data rate when a client is downloading, it will match your rate limits (or less if the bandwidth to your uplink is limited)

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **RADIUS Authentication:** Using a RADIUS server for authentication provides a more robust solution for managing user accounts.
*   **User Profiles:** Instead of rate limits in groups, create user profiles for more complex rate limiting policies or other settings.
*   **Hotspot Usage Quota:** Limit the bandwidth consumption or time spent online.
*   **Hotspot Advertisements and walled garden**: Consider enabling advertisements on your hotspot.
*   **Address Lists and Firewall:** Use address lists to manage firewall rules based on user groups or access policies.
*   **Layer 7 protocols**: You can use Layer 7 protocol matching to perform more intelligent bandwidth management.
*   **Webproxy**: You can use the web proxy for caching.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While many MikroTik configurations are done via CLI or Winbox, here's how you might interact with user and group settings via the API (Note: API is available on RouterOS 6.43 and up):

*  **Ensure that API access is turned on:** In Winbox, go to `IP` -> `Services` and verify that the `api` and `api-ssl` ports are enabled, by default they are disabled. In the CLI, use `/ip service print`
*   **Note:** The examples below use the `curl` command.  Be sure to use proper API user credentials that have the required permissions on your router.

### Example 1: Create a User Group:
*   **Endpoint:** `/user/group`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "guest"
    }
    ```
    *  `name`: The name for the new group.

*   **Curl Command:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u <username>:<password> -d '{"name":"guest"}'  https://<router_ip>/rest/user/group
    ```
   *   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<router_ip>` with the correct values. `-k` disables SSL verification, you may omit `-k` if your router is properly setup with a certificate.
*   **Expected Response (Success):**
    ```json
    {"id":"*1"}
    ```
    *  The returned `id` can be used to modify or delete the group.

* **Expected Response (Error):**
    ```json
    {"message": "already have such item", "error": true}
    ```
    *  This means that the group already exists, or there was an issue.

### Example 2: Get a List of User Groups:
*   **Endpoint:** `/user/group`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Payload:** None
*   **Curl Command:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u <username>:<password> https://<router_ip>/rest/user/group
    ```
*   **Expected Response:**
    ```json
    [
        {
            "name":"read",
            "policy":"read",
            "id":"*1"
        },
        {
            "name":"full",
            "policy":"*",
            "id":"*2"
        },
        {
          "name":"guest",
           "policy":"read",
           "id":"*3"
        }
    ]
    ```
   * This returns an array of objects. Each object represents a user group, showing its `name` , `policy` and `id`.
   *  `policy`:  Indicates the access policy (read, write, full, custom).

### Example 3: Create a User:
*   **Endpoint:** `/user`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "testuser",
        "password": "testpassword",
        "group": "guest"
    }
    ```
    * `name`: The username.
    * `password`: The password for this user.
    * `group`:  The name of the group the user is assigned to.

*   **Curl Command:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -u <username>:<password> -d '{"name":"testuser", "password":"testpassword", "group":"guest"}' https://<router_ip>/rest/user
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success):**
    ```json
    {"id":"*4"}
    ```
    *  The returned `id` can be used to modify or delete the group.

* **Expected Response (Error):**
    ```json
    {"message": "already have such item", "error": true}
    ```
     * This means that the user already exists, or there was an issue.

### Example 4: Get a list of users:
*   **Endpoint:** `/user`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Payload:** None
*   **Curl Command:**
    ```bash
     curl -k -u <username>:<password> https://<router_ip>/rest/user
     ```
*  **Expected Response:**
     ```json
       [
          {
            "name":"admin",
             "group":"full",
             "id":"*0"
          },
          {
             "name":"testuser",
             "group":"guest",
             "id":"*1"
           }
       ]
     ```
   * This returns an array of objects. Each object represents a user, showing its `name`, `group` and `id`.

**Error Handling:** The API will return a JSON error response with a "message" key and `error: true` if something fails. Always check for these errors when working with the API.

**Security Notes:** API access should be carefully controlled, using strong passwords and only enabling it on secure networks.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all users and the admin account. Use a password generator for stronger passwords.
*   **API Security:** If using the API, use HTTPS/SSL, enforce strong credentials and restrict access. Only allow API access from trusted networks. Do not allow API access from untrusted networks, such as the internet.
*   **Regular Software Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest version to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall:** Implement proper firewall rules to restrict access to the router and the network.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable any services that are not needed to reduce the attack surface. (such as the default winbox port, by changing the port).
*   **User Rights and Policies:** Limit user permissions and access to only what is necessary.
*   **Regular Review:** Check the configurations periodically to ensure they meet your current security needs.
*   **Guest network:** Always isolate a guest network from your internal trusted network using a dedicated interface/VLAN and firewall rules.
*   **Use RADIUS Authentication**: Consider using a radius server, instead of using local usernames, as it is more secure, easier to administer, and scalable.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides a basic setup for user groups and rate limiting. Here's what could be improved:

*   **More Sophisticated Rate Limiting:** Use PCQ queues for better rate limiting and fair usage.
*   **Advanced Hotspot Features:** Configure walled gardens, usage quotas, and advertisements on your hotspot.
*   **Real-world Security:** Use RADIUS server for user authentication and implement more strict firewall rules.
*   **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to track performance and user activity.
*   **More Comprehensive API:** Add examples of other API calls, especially for more advanced hotspot settings.
*   **Better error handling for API:** Add example error checking and how to fix the error using the API.
*   **Automation:** Create scripts to automatically handle user creation, group assignment and settings.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

**User Management:** MikroTikâ€™s User management system allows for creating users and assigning them to groups. Users can be used for Hotspot authentication, VPN access, and other services.

**User Groups:** User groups allow you to apply policies and settings (like rate limits, firewall rules) to multiple users with a single configuration. Groups are essential for creating flexible access control for the network.

**Hotspot:** The Hotspot feature enables a secure, controlled access network. Users are prompted to log in before gaining access to the internet or other network resources.

**Rate Limiting:** Controlling bandwidth per user or group is crucial to provide a fair experience. MikroTikâ€™s rate limiting system includes simple rate limits and advanced queues.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Local Users vs. RADIUS:** Local users are simpler to set up but harder to manage in large deployments, while RADIUS offers centralized user management.
*   **Simple Rate Limits vs. PCQ:** Simple rate limits are easy to implement, but PCQ queues offer more fair and advanced rate limiting.
*   **Hotspot vs. Regular Network:** Hotspots offer secure user authentication, while regular networks are easier for trusted devices.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This document specifically targets RouterOS 6.48 and later. Some commands or features (e.g., the REST API) might behave differently or be unavailable on older versions. If your device is running a different RouterOS version, be sure to check the documentation for that specific version. Also, note that API access has changed over different RouterOS versions.
