## Initial Question
Hi, first posting here. Been using my Mikrotik router since 2017 with NO issues at all. Love it!Router: Mikrotik RB951G-2HND 5-Port Gigabit Wireless AP 1000mW; MikroTik RouterOS 6.49.6My home has a reliable 100 Mbps+ internet connection. I've confirmed that this full b/w is delivered to my PC (thru my direct-wired Mikrotik connection).The issue: I am setting up Thunderbird as a front end for my Gmail account. There is about 150 GB+ of emails to synchronize. According to Windows (11) Task Manager, T-bird is only using about 0.1 Mbps.My question: The bandwidth appears to be capped by something or other. Could some setting in my Mikrotik router be the issue?Any suggestions or courses of action are greatly appreciated!My background is tech savvy but not an expert in networking or routers. So please keep that in mind with your answers or suggestions. Thanks in Advance! ---

Sure it's not Gmail capping that connection ?150Gb is HUUUUGE !https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en ---

Thanks for your reply. I was incorrect about the amount of data. It's not 150GB, it is 27GB.I know about the daily data cap. What I'm asking about is the speed of the connection. I know I will max out the allowable data cap but I want to do it quickly, not have it take all day!Thanks again. ---

IMAP or POP? For IMAP there are sync settings. Usually you just need to sync message headers and not the whole message/attachments. ---

My experience with Gmail and IMAP is that when there are many messages in inbox (several thousand which in my case translates into a couple of gigabytes of space consumed), then sync rate plummets. IMO nothing to do with router. ---
