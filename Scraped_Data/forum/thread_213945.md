Assumption: When running Bridge VLAN setups, the bridge must be a tagged port on the VLAN for Layer 3 services to function through the network.Assumption is false; make all bridge VLAN untagged. Make exceptions with:Code:Select allThank you, but I'm not quite following your suggestion. Are you suggesting to add the bridge as an untagged port for each VLAN entry in the table? Currently bridge is tagged for each VLAN:Code:Select all
