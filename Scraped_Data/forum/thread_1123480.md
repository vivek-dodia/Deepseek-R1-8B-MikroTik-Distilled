Is it possible to create a bit-by-bit image of a Mikrotik device and mount it on another OS, like Linux?I need to perform a forensic analysis on a Mikrotik device, but I was unable to extract the filesystem from the flash storage.Any technical articles por general guides on what to do/learn will be helpful. Thanks.

I hope it isn't possible... I know some thieves across the street who try to do just that!

Aside from updating, what can be done to prevent someone from making such forensic bit-by-bit images and make sure there is plenty of variance?

Generally by restricting physical access to device, using cabinets with locks, security guards on premises...

Aside from updating, what can be done to prevent someone from making such forensic bit-by-bit images and make sure there is plenty of variance?You can update as much as you want, if the hypothetical hacker interested in the secrets you store on your router has physical access to the device for enough time, It Is game over, physical extraction from a memory chip Is and will always be possible,  as It uses exactly the same mechanisms that allow you to store and retrieve data on/from It.Then, extracting from these data meaningful info may be easier or more difficult, but in theory It Is always possible.

I was able to dump the MTD devices contents, by PXE booting the device using a OpenWRT firmware using this guide:https://openwrt.org/toh/mikrotik/common. After running binwalk on each dump file, a SquashFS filesystem was found:Code:Select allroot@debian:/home/kauedg/Downloads/mtd# binwalk OpenWrt.mtd5.binDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------208000x5140Squashfsfilesystem,little endian,version4.0,compression:xz,size:5570552bytes,587inodes,blocksize:262144bytes,created:2025-01-1609:19:3556061400x558AFCxz compressed data56680860x567CF6xz compressed data56701600x568510xz compressed data56724580x568E0Axz compressed data56732640x569130xz compressed data56770420x569FF2xz compressed data56793040x56A8C8xz compressed data56797180x56AA66xz compressed data57725390x5814FBxz compressed data57726430x581563xz compressed data71875940x6DAC8Axz compressed data73810670x70A04BNeighborlytext,"neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=LAN /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=LAN"73825740x70A62ENeighborlytext,"neighbor discovery-settings set discover-interface-list=!dynamicc"Then I tried unsquashing the filesystem but got stuck at these errors:Code:Select allroot@debian:/home/kauedg/Downloads/mtd# unsquashfs _OpenWrt.mtd5.bin.extracted/5140.squashfsLseekfailed becauseInvalidargument

Try with extractbinwalkcommand line option:Code:Select allbinwalk--run-as=root-eOpenWrt.mtd5.binThis should extract any supported extractable data found in image includingSquashfs.

I think unsquash Is very "strict" and expects a "sound" filesystem and throws a fit even if minor issues are found.I cannot remember if a tool for recovery/fix exists, something *like* dmde which Is excellent for other filesystems.7-zip should be capable of reading a squashfs and in some cases It may be more tolerant.There may be ways to decompress the single zlib blocks and then reassemble the stuff, but provided that It works, It can usually work for text contents and similar - given the nature of squashfs - fragmentation should not be and issue, but beginning and end of files, even using trid or file to detect signatures will required a lot of manuale work with a hex viewer/editor.

It creates a file named [XXXX].squashfs and tries to unsquash it automatically but it only gives an empty directory. When I try unsquashing it manually, I get the "Lseek failed because Invalid argument" error stated above.

Could be that MT uses non-standard Squashfs for devices or it was not correctly dumped or fs is corrupted on flash. I know for sure that from CHR image Squashfs can be extracted withbinwalk, done it many times.

Could be that MT uses non-standard Squashfs for devices or it was not correctly dumped or fs is corrupted on flash. I know for sure that from CHR image Squashfs can be extracted withbinwalk, done it many times.I dumped using both OpenWRT's MTD backup function and dd tool. Also dumped with dd the /etc/mtdXro and /etc/mtdblockX devices. All files with same sequential number are the same, so unless there's some gotcha on the acquisition itself, I believe their integrity is ok. Filesystem can't be corrupt on flash because I've freshly reflashed the device with Mikrotik's released RouterOS for the device, and, as I stated before, I dumped the filesystem from the npk file succesfully.I'm following thishttps://fastcall.medium.com/dumping-fir ... 7e819199fdarticle regarding OOB, because I think it's causing the errors.

Nice find.The related blog post:https://www.j-michel.org/blog/2014/05/2 ... p-to-filesexplains in detail how the oob/spare data works, and on the main page:https://github.com/Hitsxx/NandTool/tree/masterit is clear that you can use oob and page size instead of chip ID (as it seems that there is no Winbond entry in the small program database of chips).The "normal" mtd should have a way to show (detected/guessed) sizes.The flash should be however a Winbond W25Q128JVSM, though finding the right values in the datasheet;https://www.winbond.com/hq/product/code ... =W25Q128JVseems not easy/immediate.But with a hex viewer it should be identifiable.

I got to the same datasheet as you did, but I'm inexperienced with flash chips. Could you help me identify the page and OOB size for this one?I found this in the datasheet:The W25Q128JV array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256-bytes eachBut I can't find a reference to OOB anywhere in it.

Neither can I, but again, with a hex viewer and a little patience it should be easy to identify the oob, see here another example:https://redballoonsecurity.com/flash-dump/

Some older topichttps://forum.archive.openwrt.org/viewt ... p?id=70636, but here is stated 16-byte OOB but for different MTD model of same brand with same size.Also as I see herehttps://openwrt.org/docs/techref/flashOpenWrt hasnanddumpwhich printsmtdinfo, like "Block size 131072, page size 2048, OOB size 64", alsoNand-dump-tool.pyshould print OOB size according to thislinefrom source code.If you missed it from dump tool, try to dump again and see.

Re-thinking about it, I believe you can also attempt "brute-forcing" the values.It is not like there are tens or hundreds of possibilities, the single oob record cannot logically be smaller than 8 bytes, and more likely is either 16 or 32 bytes (i don't think that odd values or non multiples of 8 or 16 are used), grouped maybe in sets of 4 or 8.The size of your dump in bytes, minus 65536*256= 16,777,216 is the total of oob space.Let's say that your dump is 17,301,504.The difference is 524,288.That can be:65,536x8 -> page size 25632,768x16-> page size 51216,384x32-> page size 10248,192x64-> page size 20484,096x128-> page size 40962,048x256-> page size 8192 <- improbableRunning that python script five or six times with these values (and with the parameter "guess" or double the times, once with "adjacent" and once with "separate") shouldn't take much time.

I was writing a long write-up on how I was troubleshooting the issue on the OOB but I found out something else was the problem. I downloaded the newest version available for squashfs-tools (https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-tools), compiled it with the tracing function enabled and fiddled around with the two squashfs files I dumped: the one from the RouterOS firmware npk file and the one I extracted from the device using nanddump, after flashing it.I checked if the information about the files could be readCode:Select all# ./unsquashfs -s ../../_routeros-7.17.1-smips.npk.extracted/1000.squashfssquashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x0,bytes96Founda valid SQUASHFS4:0superblock on../../_routeros-7.17.1-smips.npk.extracted/1000.squashfs.Creationorlastappend timeThuJan3008:26:562025Filesystemsize5743084bytes(5608.48Kbytes/5.48Mbytes)CompressionxzBlocksize262144Filesystemisexportable via NFSInodesare compressedDataiscompressedUids/Gids(Idtable)are compressedFragmentsare compressedTailendsarenotpackedintofragmentsXattrsarenotstoredDuplicatesare removedNumberoffragments51Numberofinodes593Numberofids1squashfs:sBlk.s.inode_table_start0x57706csquashfs:sBlk.s.directory_table_start0x57848esquashfs:sBlk.s.fragment_table_start0x579dacsquashfs:sBlk.s.lookup_table_start0x57a1d6squashfs:sBlk.s.id_table_start0x57a1e4squashfs:sBlk.s.xattr_id_table_start0xffffffffffffffff# ./unsquashfs -s ../../_mtd5.nanddump.bin.extracted/7534D0.squashfssquashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x0,bytes96Founda valid SQUASHFS4:0superblock on../../_mtd5.nanddump.bin.extracted/7534D0.squashfs.Creationorlastappend timeThuJan3008:26:562025Filesystemsize5743084bytes(5608.48Kbytes/5.48Mbytes)CompressionxzBlocksize262144Filesystemisexportable via NFSInodesare compressedDataiscompressedUids/Gids(Idtable)are compressedFragmentsare compressedTailendsarenotpackedintofragmentsXattrsarenotstoredDuplicatesare removedNumberoffragments51Numberofinodes593Numberofids1squashfs:sBlk.s.inode_table_start0x57706csquashfs:sBlk.s.directory_table_start0x57848esquashfs:sBlk.s.fragment_table_start0x579dacsquashfs:sBlk.s.lookup_table_start0x57a1d6squashfs:sBlk.s.id_table_start0x57a1e4squashfs:sBlk.s.xattr_id_table_start0xffffffffffffffffThe only difference was the filenameCode:Select all# diff <(./unsquashfs -s ../../_mtd5.nanddump.bin.extracted/7534D0.squashfs) <(./unsquashfs -s ../../_routeros-7.17.1-smips.npk.extracted/1000.squashfs)2c2<Founda valid SQUASHFS4:0superblock on../../_mtd5.nanddump.bin.extracted/7534D0.squashfs.--->Founda valid SQUASHFS4:0superblock on../../_routeros-7.17.1-smips.npk.extracted/1000.squashfs.This is the initial output from the npk file listing:Code:Select all# ./unsquashfs -l ../../_routeros-7.17.1-smips.npk.extracted/1000.squashfs | headsquashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x0,bytes96squashfs:read_id_table:no_ids1squashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x57a1e4,bytes8squashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x57a1de,bytes2squashfs:read_block:block@0x57a1de,4uncompressed bytes

No idea, but from what you posted it seems that in one case, just after reading at 0x57a1e4:squashfs: read_bytes: reading from position 0x57a1e4, bytes 8it "skips" to :squashfs: read_bytes: reading from position 0xffffffffffffffff, bytes 2so the issue is probably in the 8 bytes @0x57a1e4.

@kauedg Just by having same superbock in both images it doesn't mean that other data in image isn't corrupt.By log it is corrupted inode table.Analisis by trace log and source:8 bytes for inode table positions are read and stored inid_index_tablefrom position 0x57a1e4, call stack:https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... hfs.c#L659https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... h-4.c#L509Code:Select all...squashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0x57a1e4,bytes8And it fails when reading table bytes by iterating positions, log call stack:https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... h-4.c#L530https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... hfs.c#L761https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... hfs.c#L665https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... hfs.c#L659https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... hfs.c#L699https://github.com/plougher/squashfs-to ... h-4.c#L527Code:Select allsquashfs:read_bytes:readingfromposition0xffffffffffffffff,bytes2Lseekfailed becauseInvalidargument
read_block:failed to read block@0xffffffffffffffffread_id_table:failed to read id table block...By this,id_index_tableis corrupt, since logged position is @0xffffffffffffffff (max unsigned long long) which is result of invalid value for its data type and such position in file is invalid (Lseek failed...). So as @jaclaz mentioned at 0x57a1e4 position 8 bytes are corrupt, where inode table positions are stored.Did you strip correctly OOB data from image? Squashfs superblock is located in first 96 bytes and OOB data will not corrupt it if MTD page size is larger, which is.

I'll also try reproducing it on another dump file I have here.Any help will be appreciated on extracting the /nova/lib/console/1073741824.mem file.

So, there are two "layers".1024+16=104063*1040=6552065520+16=65536Interesting.It would make sense to have these extra 16 bytes at the end of a group of "sectors" to "get even" to a multiple of 1024,  64*1024=65536.

I got another dump done with dd which doesn't have this. The steps above are only good for the dump I tried first, unfortunately. Now I'm trying to figure out where all the offsets come from, without knowing the value an address should have beforehand.

I don't know, but the math sounds similar to the way some of the enterprise SSD's or HD's drives are made (many of these are formatted with 520 or 528 bytes instead of the usual 512).The actual "cell" (or sector group) size on the device should be anyway 4096 bytes or a multiple, and these drives can usually (with some spells and magic commands) be converted back to 512 bytes/sector, so some form of "slack" must exist, either 8 bytes every 32768 or 16 bytes every 65536. I believe.
