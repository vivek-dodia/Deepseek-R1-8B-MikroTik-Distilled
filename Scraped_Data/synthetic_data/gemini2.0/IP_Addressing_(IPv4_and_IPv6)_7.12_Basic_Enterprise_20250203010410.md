Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive deep dive of MikroTik RouterOS, focusing on your specified parameters and expanding on the requested topics.  This is a significant undertaking, so I'll break it down into manageable sections.

**Assumptions:**

*   You have a MikroTik device running RouterOS v7.12 (or a compatible version).
*   You have basic networking knowledge (e.g., IP addressing, subnets).
*   You have access to the device via Winbox or SSH.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:** We are configuring a MikroTik router in an enterprise environment. We want to assign a static IPv4 address to the wireless interface `wlan-16`, which operates on the subnet `190.191.17.0/24`. We will also set up basic DHCP, DNS, and firewall configurations. We will enable and explore RoMON, Winbox, and certificates, further diving into several of the other requested topics.

**MikroTik Specific Requirements:**

*   Assign a static IPv4 address to `wlan-16`.
*   Configure a DHCP server for the same subnet.
*   Set up a basic firewall for security.
*   Enable and configure secure access.
*   Explore relevant features such as IP pools, routing, RoMON, Certificates, etc.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

We will use both CLI and Winbox to demonstrate these steps.

**Step 1: Assign Static IPv4 Address**

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=190.191.17.1/24 interface=wlan-16
    ```

    *   `add`:  Creates a new address configuration.
    *   `address=190.191.17.1/24`:  The IPv4 address and subnet mask in CIDR notation. We choose `.1` for the router's interface.
    *   `interface=wlan-16`:  The specific wireless interface we are targeting.
*   **Winbox:**
    1.  Go to `IP` > `Addresses`.
    2.  Click the "+" button.
    3.  Set the `Address` to `190.191.17.1/24`.
    4.  Set the `Interface` to `wlan-16`.
    5.  Click `Apply` then `OK`.

**Step 2: Configure DHCP Server**

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool ranges=190.191.17.10-190.191.17.254
    /ip dhcp-server
    add name=dhcp1 interface=wlan-16 address-pool=dhcp_pool lease-time=1d
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=190.191.17.0/24 gateway=190.191.17.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```

    *   `/ip pool add`: Creates an IP pool named `dhcp_pool` with IP addresses ranging from `190.191.17.10` to `190.191.17.254`.
    *   `/ip dhcp-server add`: Creates a DHCP server named `dhcp1` bound to `wlan-16`, using the `dhcp_pool`, with a lease time of 1 day (`1d`).
    *   `/ip dhcp-server network add`: Specifies DHCP server network settings.
        *   `address`: The network address and subnet.
        *   `gateway`:  The gateway IP address (our router's IP on the wlan-16 interface).
        *   `dns-server`: Specifies the DNS servers (Google Public DNS here).
*   **Winbox:**
    1. Go to `IP` > `Pool` and click "+". Name it "dhcp_pool" and set the range as above. Apply/OK.
    2.  Go to `IP` > `DHCP Server`.
    3.  Click the "+" button to create a new server, name it "dhcp1", set the `Interface` to `wlan-16`, and the `Address Pool` to the `dhcp_pool` you created. Set a lease time. Apply/OK.
    4. Switch to `Networks` and click `+`.
    5. Set the `Address` to `190.191.17.0/24`, `Gateway` to `190.191.17.1`, and add DNS servers.

**Step 3: Basic Firewall Configuration**

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input action=accept in-interface=wlan-16 comment="Allow from local network"
    add chain=input action=drop connection-state=invalid comment="Drop Invalid Connections"
    add chain=input action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established and Related"
    add chain=input action=drop in-interface=all-ethernet comment="Drop all other Input (Default)"
    add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established and Related"
    add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid comment="Drop invalid connections"
    add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other Forward (Default)"
    /ip firewall nat
    add chain=srcnat out-interface=internet action=masquerade comment="Masquerade for Internet traffic"
    ```
    *  `/ip firewall filter add`: Adds firewall rules to different chains.
        *   `chain=input`:  Rules applied to traffic destined *to* the router.
        *   `chain=forward`: Rules applied to traffic being routed *through* the router.
        *   `action=accept`:  Allows the traffic.
        *   `action=drop`: Blocks the traffic.
        *   `connection-state=established,related`:  Allows traffic related to already-established connections, such as responses from servers.
        *   `connection-state=invalid`: Drops malformed or invalid connections.
        *   `in-interface=wlan-16`: Applies the rule only to traffic coming in on that interface.
        *   `in-interface=all-ethernet`: Drop all inbound from Ethernet (where 'internet' would be a common out-interface).
    *   `/ip firewall nat add`: Adds NAT rules.
        *   `chain=srcnat`: Source NAT chain.
        *   `out-interface=internet`: Interface the traffic goes out (you may need to change this, see notes below).
        *   `action=masquerade`:  Performs NAT, replacing the source IP with the router's IP.
*   **Winbox:**
    1. Go to `IP` > `Firewall`.
    2.  Add rules to the `Filter Rules` tab as above, paying special attention to chain, action, and interface properties.
    3.  Go to the `NAT` tab and add the masquerade rule.

**Step 4: RoMON**

*  **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
     /tool romon set enabled=yes
    ```
*  **Winbox:**
    1.  Go to `Tools` > `RoMON`
    2.  Check `Enabled`

   RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) allows management of other MikroTik devices without needing IP reachability between the managing device. This creates a virtual private out-of-band management plane. You will need to configure this on other devices and enable the same RoMON IDs for the devices to discover each other.

**Step 5: Winbox Secure Access**

*   **Winbox:**
    1.  Go to `IP` > `Services`.
    2.  Double click `www`, change the port to anything but `80` (e.g., `8080`) to avoid browser caching.
    3.  Disable `www`
    4.  Double click `winbox`.
    5.  If needed, limit to source addresses you expect to manage from, or use certificates.
   You can change the `winbox` service port as well. Winbox also has built in authentication features, including strong user authentication and permissions that can be configured via `System` > `Users`.
    Security note: Always disable HTTP access and use the `https` service instead of `www`. Change the default `winbox` port for extra security.  You can use certificates (see next step).

**Step 6: Certificates**

*   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
        /certificate
        add name=local-server common-name=your_router_name key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server
        sign local-server ca=no
    ```
    * `/certificate add`: Add a new certificate with the specified settings.
    *  `/certificate sign`: Sign the certificate, making it self-signed.
*   **Winbox:**
    1.  Go to `System` > `Certificates`.
    2.  Click "+". Add a local cert with the above values (common name being the IP or hostname of the device).
    3. Select `Sign` and set CA to `no`.
    4. Go back to IP>Services and enable https, making sure to select the local server certificate.
    Certificates can be used to securely encrypt Winbox traffic, among other things.  Using a self-signed certificate here can be okay for personal use, however, a certificate signed by a trusted CA is highly recommended.

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall:** Forgetting the masquerade rule, causing clients to have no internet access.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `ping` from a client device. If the ping fails to reach external IPs, check your NAT rules.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect firewall rules that block all traffic.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**  Use `torch` on your interfaces to see the traffic flow, verify `count` values on firewall rules.
*   **Pitfall:** Issues with DHCP server.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use the `/ip dhcp-server lease print` command to check if devices are getting IP addresses, check `lease-time`.
    * **Troubleshooting:**  Make sure the DHCP server is enabled and has a valid `address-pool` assigned to it.
*   **Error Scenario:**  If a rule is misconfigured such as `action=drop` on `in-interface=wlan-16`, no client will connect, use `count` values of the firewall to identify the rule.
*   **Diagnostics:**
    *   `ping <target IP>`: Test basic reachability.
    *   `traceroute <target IP>`:  Trace the path a packet takes.
    *   `/tool torch interface=wlan-16`: Monitor traffic on the interface in real time.
    *   `/log print`: View system logs for errors.
    *   `/interface print stats`: Display interface statistics and check for errors, retransmissions.
    * `ip dhcp-server lease print` and `ip dhcp-server print` to analyze DHCP issues.
    * `interface monitor-traffic <interface>` will show real-time traffic on any interface.
*   **Note:** MikroTik often uses a last-rule-matches method when configuring firewall chains, be mindful of rule order.
*  **Error Handling:** MikroTik error handling typically uses the `print` commands to output the cause. Log files are key to troubleshooting.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping:**
    *   From a client connected to `wlan-16`: `ping 190.191.17.1` (router's IP).
    *   From a client connected to `wlan-16`: `ping 8.8.8.8` (external).
*   **Web Access**
    *  Browse to the router's management page via https (or the new custom port).
*   **DHCP:** Check the client's IP address; it should be within the DHCP pool.
*   **Firewall:** Connect using SSH (or Winbox), then add a new firewall `drop` rule `input chain` to the `wlan-16` network and verify the connection drops.
*   **RoMON:** Use Winbox on a connected device to monitor and configure other devices using RoMON.
*   **Certificates:** Make sure your browser accepts the certificate or add the certificate to the client's trust store. Check your winbox connection status (padlock) to see the certificate is being used.
*   **Torch:** Use the `torch` tool to verify traffic flow on a given interface.

    *  Sets two routes for each VRF network.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

MikroTik's REST API is available using the `/rest` resource, which is a service that will need to be configured to handle authentication and permissions as per `IP` > `Services`. The following is an example of retrieving interface information and adding a route.

**Authentication:**
The MikroTik API uses session-based authentication. Log in using the `/login` endpoint and use the `session` key provided by this endpoint for other API requests.

1. **Login:**
   * **Endpoint:** `/rest/login`
   * **Method:** `POST`
   * **Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`
   * **Request Body (JSON):**
     ```json
     {
       "username": "your_api_username",
       "password": "your_api_password"
     }
     ```
   * **Successful Response (JSON):**
      ```json
     {
        "session": "your_session_key_here"
     }
     ```

   *  **Error Response:**
      ```json
      { "message": "invalid username or password" }
      ```

2. **Get Interface Details (using the session key):**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/rest/interface`
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Headers:**
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
        *   `Authorization: Bearer your_session_key_here`

    *   **Example Response (JSON):**
        ```json
        [
            {
                "name": "ether1",
                "type": "ether",
                "mtu": 1500,
                "l2mtu": 1598,
                "mac-address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
                 "disabled": false,
                 "running": true
            },
            {
               "name": "wlan1",
               "type": "wlan",
                "mtu": 1500,

                "disabled": false,
                "running": true
            }
        ]
        ```

3. **Add an IP Route (using the session key):**
   *  **Endpoint:** `/rest/ip/route`
   *   **Method:** `POST`
   *   **Headers:**
        *   `Content-Type: application/json`
       *   `Authorization: Bearer your_session_key_here`
   *   **Request Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
            "dst-address": "10.10.10.0/24",
            "gateway": "192.168.88.1"
         }
        ```
    *   **Successful Response (JSON):**
        ```json
        {"message": "add"}
        ```
    *  **Error Response:**
         ```json
        { "message": "some parameters are missing" }
        ```

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** Combines multiple interfaces into a single layer 2 segment, allowing devices on different interfaces to communicate as if they were connected to the same switch. MikroTik implements this using Bridge interfaces. The `bridge` resource in `/interface bridge` controls this functionality.
*   **Routing:**  The process of directing traffic between different networks using IP addresses. MikroTik uses routing tables and protocols (OSPF, BGP) to make routing decisions. Static routes can be created using the `/ip route` resource, and routing information is configured in the `/routing` resource.
*   **Firewall:** Protects the network from unauthorized access by inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic based on defined rules. MikroTik's firewall is configured through the `/ip firewall` resource, which has `filter` for layer-3 rules and `nat` for network address translation.
* **DHCP Server:** Provides clients on the network with dynamic IP addressing from a pre-configured address pool. The `/ip dhcp-server` is where the main server is configured, along with an associated address range defined in `/ip pool`. Network-specific options are configured with `/ip dhcp-server network`.
*   **MAC Addresses:**  Every interface has a unique address. Used for layer-2 communications.
* **VLANs:** Logically segregate a physical network. MikroTik implements these using VLAN interfaces associated with a specific interface. The `vlan-id` setting groups those interfaces into a specific VLAN.
*   **Connection Tracking:** MikroTik monitors TCP, UDP connections and associated states (established, new, related) allowing more specific and efficient firewall rules.
*   **NAT:** Allows clients with private IP addresses to communicate with the internet by re-writing the source IP to the external IP address.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Change Default Credentials:** The first thing to do is always change the default admin password for the device.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable unused services (e.g., `www`, `api`, `telnet`) to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Use HTTPS and Winbox Securely:** Always disable HTTP and restrict winbox access to known IPs, using certificates is also highly recommended.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Use long, random passwords for all users.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement a "deny by default" firewall approach. Allow only explicitly required traffic.
*   **Regular Software Updates:** Keep RouterOS up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Review logs regularly for suspicious activity.
*   **User Permissions:** Grant users only necessary privileges.
*   **Secure API Access:** Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for API access and restrict access via IP.
*   **Consider VPN:** Use IPsec, WireGuard, or OpenVPN for remote access instead of exposing the management interface directly.
*  **Use an ACL on management interfaces** to restrict access to specific IP addresses.
*  **Monitor SNMP** for any malicious activity.
*   **Keep RoMON Access Secure:** Do not leave RoMON open on untrusted networks.
*   **Enable logging** to a remote server (e.g syslog) for advanced log analysis.
*   **Use certificates** where you can, especially for encrypted remote connections.

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for MikroTik Topics**

(Due to the sheer volume of topics, I will provide a representative set of deeper dives here, focusing on practical and less common applications within the context of our initial scenario. The remainder of these could easily constitute a separate large document):

* **MAC Address Control (MAC Server)**
    * **Concept:** Use of MAC addresses to manage network access. Can be used for simple ACL lists and also in conjunction with RADIUS authentication
     *  **Configuration (CLI)**
        ```mikrotik
          /interface wireless access-list
           add mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 comment="Allowed Device 1"
            add mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 comment="Allowed Device 2"
         /interface wireless
          set wlan16 access-list=yes
        ```
        *  **Explanation**
            *  `/interface wireless access-list`: Creates a list of allowed MAC addresses.
            *  `/interface wireless set`: Sets an access list on a particular wireless interface.
    *   **Example:** Allow only a few devices to connect to the WiFi.
 *   **Quality of Service (QoS) using Queues**
    *   **Concept:** Prioritizing some traffic over others
    * **Configuration (CLI):**
        ```mikrotik
        /queue type add name="priority-queue" kind=pcq pcq-rate=100000 pcq-classifier=dst-address
       /queue simple
        add name="priority-queue-192" target=192.168.17.0/24 max-limit=1000000 queue=priority-queue
        add name="default-queue" target=all max-limit=500000 queue=default
         ```
        *   **Explanation:**
             * `/queue type`: creates a queue type using a per-connection queue to limit traffic for each unique destination address.
             *  `/queue simple`: Create two simple queues: One that utilizes the newly created priority type, and a second queue for all other traffic.
       *  **Example:** Prioritize traffic to certain IP addresses.
 *   **Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)**
       * **Concept:** MPLS allows for layer-2 encapsulation of layer-3 traffic, enabling advanced traffic routing in large networks. While it's an advanced topic, a basic example of label distribution is useful for context.
        * **Configuration (CLI):**
             ```mikrotik
                 /mpls ldp
                 set enabled=yes router-id=<router-id> interface=ether1
                 /mpls interface
                  add interface=ether1
                  ```
             *   **Explanation:**
                   *   `mpls ldp set`: Enables the LDP (Label Distribution Protocol) that will dynamically advertise labels between routers on the same MPLS network.
                   *  `mpls interface add`: Enables MPLS on a specific interface.
            *   **Example:** This will be part of a larger network setup, not an isolated config.
 *   **Routing Protocols (OSPF Example)**
      * **Concept:** Dynamic route distribution using OSPF
         * **Configuration (CLI):**
          ```mikrotik
           /routing ospf instance
           add name=ospf1 router-id=10.10.10.1
           /routing ospf area
             add instance=ospf1 name=backbone area-id=0.0.0.0
           /routing ospf interface
             add instance=ospf1 interface=wlan16 cost=100 area=backbone
           ```
         *   **Explanation**
             *   `/routing ospf instance`:  Create an OSPF instance.
             *   `/routing ospf area`:  Add a backbone area for this instance
              * `/routing ospf interface`:  Assign an interface to the area
         *   **Example:** Connect multiple devices using OSPF in a routed network.
 *   **Virtual Private Networks (WireGuard Example)**
    *   **Concept:** Securely connect two networks using an encrypted tunnel.
      * **Configuration (CLI):**

        ```mikrotik
        /interface wireguard
         add name=wg1 listen-port=13231 private-key="<private key>"
        /ip address
         add address=10.100.0.1/24 interface=wg1
        /interface wireguard peers
         add interface=wg1 public-key="<public key of peer>" allowed-address=10.100.0.2/32 endpoint=192.168.1.200:13231 persistent-keepalive=25
        ```
        * **Explanation**
           *   `/interface wireguard`: Adds a WireGuard interface, sets the port, and specifies the private key.
           *   `/ip address`: Adds an address for this interface.
           *    `/interface wireguard peers`: Sets up a peer configuration with public key, IP for this tunnel, and the peer's external address.

         * **Example:** Connect two MikroTik networks privately over the internet using WireGuard.
 *  **System Information & Utilities: Watchdog**
     * **Concept:** Automatically reboot device if there is a failure
     * **Configuration CLI**
         ```mikrotik
         /system watchdog set watchdog-timer=yes
         ```
        * **Explanation**
           *  `/system watchdog`: Sets the watchdog to enable the system reboot if unresponsive for a given period of time.
         * **Example:** Automatically restart device after a failure.

**Trade-offs and Considerations:**

*   **Bridging vs. Routing:** Bridging is simpler for local networks, but routing provides more segmentation and control, especially with VRFs.
*   **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:** Static routes are easier to configure for smaller networks, but dynamic routing (OSPF, BGP) offers better scalability and fault tolerance for larger networks.
*   **Simple vs. Advanced Queues:** Simple queues are easy to use for basic QoS, while advanced queues and PCQ are more suitable for complex traffic shaping.
*   **Self-Signed vs. CA Certificates:**  Self-signed certificates are easier to implement but can raise browser security warnings, CA-signed certificates are essential for trusted environments.
*  **Firewall complexity** Can impact performance, more rules means more processing.
