## Initial Question

Hello, Is it possible to run two versions of CAPsMAN on the same router (CCR2004)?My scenario:I have a CCR2004 currently running CAPsMAN Legacy managing 30 access points. I need to integrate new access points (C52iG-5HaxD2HaxD), which require the new version of CAPsMAN.Can I set up a new CAPsMAN instance for the newer version on the same router while keeping the existing CAPsMAN Legacy configuration active and running simultaneously?Best Regards, Carlos Eduardo Diasd ---

Yes you can.When using ROS version 7.13 or higher, load wireless package as well and you have both environments. ---
