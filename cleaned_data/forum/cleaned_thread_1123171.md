## Initial Question
Good afternoon colleagues!Please tell me how to use the blink command.Several times tried to use. then tried experimenting in the lab, got no results. There is a very modest description in the documentation.blink ([id, name])Blink Ethernet leds.When running the command both from winbox and via CLI I see no change in the blinking of the led. No matter on one device or the other. ---

## Response 1
^^ Wondering the same thing.Tried on CRS317 and CRS309, no blinking! ---

## Response 2
The blinking must be supported from ethernet chipset.For example, on my CRS112 work. ---
