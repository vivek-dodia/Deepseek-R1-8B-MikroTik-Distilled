Thanks @infabo.@yhfung, let's go step by step for both PPTP and L2TP. I will save the lecture regarding PPTP not being secure any more and get to the technical point.PPTP: the complete protocol consists of two parts, the session negotiation and authentication using TCP where the server listens at port 1723, and the actual transport of data which uses GRE. GRE has no notion of ports and therefore it can only traverse NAT under certain conditions, one of them being that the NAT device even bothers about GRE.To make things more complicated, somewhere at 6.4x times, Mikrotik has identified some security flaw with GRE and "fixed" it; a side effect of that "fix" is that now the connection tracking sets the connection-state attribute of incoming GRE packets as invalid, unless you enable the PPTP helper under /ip/firewall/service-port.So post the export of the configuration of the router you have set as a PPTP server so that we could check whether its own configuration is correct; even if it is, the clients may be able to connect from some remote networks and unable from others, because treatment of GRE in the NATing devices in those remote networks may differ.Regarding L2TP - both session negotiation and data transport uses UDP on port 1701, officially at both server side and client side, but most implementations tolerate any client-side port. However, due to the weakness of the encryption and authentication methods of L2TP (actually, PPP) itself, IPsec in transport mode is normally used to encapsulate and encrypt the L2TP connection, which means that all the routers between the client and the server can only see traffic on UDP port 500 and ESP traffic (if both the server and the client have a public address) or on UDP ports 500 and 4500 (if at least one of the two participants is behind NAT).To make things more complicated, the embedded Windows client doesn't like the server to run on a private address unless you change some settings in the Windows Registry, and the protocol is not designed to support connection of multiple clients of the same server from behind the same public address if both of them use the same port at their side, which is what Windows clients do. To overcome that, you have to set the server up in a complicated way (there is a trick for that in Linux but Mikrotik never implemented it), but I assume it is not the issue you are fighting with right now. So like in the PPTP case, post the export of the configuration to see the issues. Unlike in the PPTP case, IPsec can traverse any NAT, so if something does not work even if the server is set up properly, the reason is most likely to be some active filtering on the path between the server and the client. But as you could make it work with OpenWRT, it should not be the case.

Thanks @sindy's reply.Now my concentration is PPTP first in v7.x. If PPTP is complete, then we will proceed to L2TP in v7.x.In this afternoon, I installed a PPTP server in 2000 km away from my home. Please see as follows:/interface pptp-server server set enabled=yes/ppp secret add local-address=172.16.88.1 name=vpn password=vpn profile=default-encryption remote-address=172.16.88.5 service=pptp/ip firewall filteradd action=accept chain=input comment="PPTP China" dst-port=1723 \in-interface=ether1 protocol=tcpPlease note the firewall filter rule was located in the first line in the table. The remote router hAP ac^3, v7.16.2, public ip=1.1.1.1(for illustration), local ip=172.16.88.0/24. I used an Android tablet with pptp settings ip=1.1.1.1, user=vpn, password=vpn. The test result failed.MikroTik Engineers or others may provide answers to fix the problems.

I have three PPTP clients, namely Huawei pad, Honor phone and Windows 10. The tests were carried out using Huawei pad and got failure results. When I changed it to Honor phone and Windows 10, both tests were successful. I made another PPTP test using Huawei pad to my friend's DDWRT PPTP server with successful result.In the meantime, I have set up a PPTP server on one of my CHRs running 7.16.2 on a public address, and with a Windows 10 client just 500 km away behind a NAT the experience is same like yours, it just works. But before I configured the NAT at the client side properly, it didn't work, and both the client and the server were so stubbornly retrying that I find it hard to believe that the reason could be timing issues.You are right that it is the job of the Mikrotik developers to fix issues, but to make them even start thinking about it, you would have to provide them with a strong evidence (= pcap files from both ends ans supout.rif from the Tik), proving that each party receives everything the other party sends and nevertheless the connection does not establish. The DDWRT is most likely not on the same ISP like your Tik, so there is enough space for doubt. If you could provide the supout and pcaps both from a working Mikrotik running 6.49.13 and from a non-working Mikrotik running 7.16.2 on the same public address, it would be an unambiguous proof. But even if you manage to prove your point, I assume the priority will be very low as the security of PPTP is really far below today's requirements. So think of it, and if it is worth it and you can collect the evidence, file a support ticket onMikrotik ServiceDesk, providing all the evidence files as attachments to the ticket.The machine is Huawei pad. I have Wireshark but I do not how to capture the required data. When the PPTP client started the connection, there was no log displayed but it only showed the connection failed.Just let the Wireshark capture on the correct interface with a capture filterhost pptp.ser.ver.ip. But if you cannot run Wireshark directly on the Huawei pad, running a sniffer on the router through which the Huawei pad is connected to the internet should be sufficient - as you use Mikrotik for longer than me, I assume your shelves are full of retired boxes that are nevertheless sufficient as sniffing boxes for this kind of test.BTW, am I right to assume that all the three devices you used for the test were connected the same way, via the same local WiFi?I used WireGuard to one of my friend's router, then I switched to WinBox to hAP ac^3.You can either sniff directly into a file on the hAP ac3 or save the sniffer buffer into a file after finishing sniffing, and then you can download the file using Winbox.The next step is L2TP/IPsec.OK, let's try that one, same procedure - sniff on the hAP ac3 for ports UDP 500 and 4500 and see what that shows./tool sniffer quick protocol=udp port=500,4500- start like this and once you are sure which address is the one from behind which the client connects, add it to the filter conditions to eliminate the noise from the scanbots.And show me the result of/ip firewall filter print chain=inputonce you set the firewall up for L2TP/IPsec.

The L2TP/IPsec tests were also satisfied. I am sorry for not showing experimentation results. The I2TP/IPsec RouterOS scripts were showed in the first thread. Besides the the three machine passed the L2TP/IPsec tests, two additional machines iPhone and iPad passed it.I thank sindy for you kind kelp and your advice. I shall re-look again your reply and some how to think the questions. I wish have a very good and happy new year.
