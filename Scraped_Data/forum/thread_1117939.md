Can someone please take a look over these and see if they spot something wonky?I seem to be unable to connect to the RouterOS API from 10.0.105.0/24 network and I seem to be unable to get my IPv6 port-forward/NAT thing to work properly? It instead says it's filtered atm.This is what the a curl says to the Router's webui:Code:Select allConnectedto10.0.105.1(10.0.105.1)port4443*ALPN:curl offers h2,http/1.1*TLSv1.3(OUT),TLS handshake,Clienthello(1):*OpenSSLSSL_connect:SSL_ERROR_SYSCALLinconnection to10.0.105.1:4443*Closingconnection
curl:(35)OpenSSLSSL_connect:SSL_ERROR_SYSCALLinconnection to10.0.105.1:4443Here's the config:Code:Select all/ip firewall

IPv6:in filter/forward, there is no rule allowing dst-nated connections to get through before the final "drop whatever did not come in via LAN" one.IPv4:since you have disabled the "drop whatever did not come in via LAN" rule in filter/input rather than keeping it at the end of that chain and placing accept exceptions before it, the api-ssl service is now accessible to the worldtheaction=accept chain=input dst-port=4443 in-interface-list=VLANs log=yes protocol=tcp src-address=10.0.105.0/24rule does not override the restrictions in the/ip servicesection, as firewall comes first and the two parts of the configuration do not affect each other.set sshaddress=192.168.99.0/24,192.168.2.0/24port=10222set www-ssladdress=192.168.99.0/24,192.168.2.0/24certificate=webfig disabled=no port=4443 tls-version=only-1.2(and the rule itself is useless because whatever it does not accept is accepted by default)

Only do so in the firewall section and keep the drop whatever rule?

What would be the right way to ...Well...theright way...  I'm probably too old to issue statements this strong. WhatI personally preferis to drop everything (using the last rule in each filter chain) and only explicitly accept the necessary exceptions. Because if you do it that way, your legal users will tell you quickly that you forgot to permit something. With the other way round, i.e. when you accept everything by default and only explicitly drop some exceptions, your illegal users will never tell you that you forgot to forbid something.As for where to define permitted addresses of clients who are allowed to access the management services like ssh or www - the settings under/ip servicework at application level, so the TCP SYN makes it to the socket and if it came from an address that is not allowed, the application sends back a TCP RST, so port scanners do notice that something is listening there, and theoretically there may be some vulnerability in the TCP stack that allows some kind of a magic SYN packet do something nasty even before the list of allowed addresses is consulted. So this is one reason why I prefer to restrict access to router's own services using the firewall filter chain input; the other one is that I prefer to do the same kind of thing at the same place even if multiple possibilities exist, as doing so spares my future self some time.

Another thing I found is that if my Kubernetes nodes announce svc addresses (via BGP) and I can connect to them from an IoT network, it loses the connection?Example from Mosquitto:Code:Select all1736229933:Newclient connectedfrom10.0.50.121:49191asDVES_5DF70D(p2,c1,k30,u'tasmota').1736229933:ClientDVES_5DF70D closed its connection.From inside the tasmota plug's console:Code:Select all07:07:43.482MQT:Attemptingconnection...07:07:47.799MQT:Connectfailed to10.96.69.10:1883,rc-4.Retryin120secCurrent firewall for IPv4:Code:Select all/ip firewall address-listaddaddress=10.0.0.0/24list=backdoor-addr-v4addaddress=172.17.50.0/24list=backdoor-addr-v4addaddress=10.0.1.0/24list=backdoor-addr-v4addaddress=172.17.51.0/24list=backdoor-addr-v4addaddress=<snip>.sn.mynetname.net list=WANs/ip firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept established,related,untracked"connection-state=established,related,untrackedaddaction=drop chain=input comment="defconf: drop invalid"connection-state=invalidaddaction=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept ICMP"protocol=icmpaddaction=accept chain=input comment="defconf: accept to local loopback (for CAPsMAN)"dst-address=127.0.0.1addaction=accept chain=input dst-address-list=WANsdst-port=51821protocol=udpaddaction=drop chain=input comment="defconf: drop all not coming from LAN"in-interface-list=!LANaddaction=drop chain=input disabled=yes dst-port=8291in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcpaddaction=drop chain=input comment="Drop port 53 access from WAN"disabled=yes dst-port=53in-interface-list=WAN protocol=tcpaddaction=drop chain=input comment="Block NTP from WAN"disabled=yes dst-port=123in-interface-list=WAN protocol=udpaddaction=accept chain=input dst-port=4443in-interface-list=VLANslog=yes protocol=tcp src-address=10.0.105.0/24addaction=accept chain=input dst-port=161protocol=udp src-address=192.168.99.0/24addaction=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept in ipsec policy"ipsec-policy=in,ipsecaddaction=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept out ipsec policy"ipsec-policy=out,ipsecaddaction=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment="defconf: fasttrack"connection-state=established,related hw-offload=yesaddaction=accept chain=forward comment="defconf: accept established,related, untracked"connection-state=established,related,untrackedaddaction=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop invalid"connection-state=invalidaddaction=drop chain=forward comment="defconf: drop all from WAN not DSTNATed"connection-nat-state=!dstnat connection-state=newin-interface-list=WAN/ip firewall mangleaddaction=mark-connection chain=prerouting comment="Mark connections for hairpin NAT"disabled=yes dst-address-list=WANsnew-connection-mark="Hairpin NAT"passthrough=yes src-address-list=LANs
