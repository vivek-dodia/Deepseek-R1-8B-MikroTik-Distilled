```
/queue type
add cake-diffserv=diffserv4 cake-flowmode=dual-srchost cake-nat=yes kind=cake name=cake-WAN-tx
add cake-diffserv=besteffort cake-flowmode=dual-dsthost cake-nat=yes kind=cake name=cake-WAN-rx
/queue simple
add comment="RX= Target Upload TX = Target Download" max-limit=950M/95M name=cake-WAN queue=cake-WAN-rx/cake-WAN-tx target=bridge1_WAN
```

I found the same: rx/tx values in simple queue are swapped compared to what one would expect: RX is target interface upload and TX is target interface downloadThe configuration below works well on 1000/100 cable connections with users complaining about downloads or uploads of many and/or large files interferes with parallel Teams/Zooms etc. calls.The rx besteffort queue to limit the ingress WAN traffic shortly before the ISP traffic shaper kicks in. This has shown to have less impact on latency.Th tx diffserv4 queue does a good job in prioritizing outgoing Teams/Zoom traffic if the uplink is fully loaded. At least the complaints have stopped.Code:Select all
