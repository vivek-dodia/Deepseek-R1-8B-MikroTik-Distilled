I'm having a little issue trying to get the CRS326 to work like the Dell Switch. The managed Dell switch has a couple vlans on it but only one is being used from the main router RB1100AHx4 (vlan100) using 10.107.100.x addresses. I can't seem to get the CRS326 to grab an IP from the main router, the CRS326 bridge is set to grab an ip from the dhcp client that the bridge is on. I'm not sure if I need to make the CRS326 a static IP instead and then make the necessary ports for vlan100.The Dell Switch managed ports goes as follows in main network closet:Ports are on vlan100port 1(Dell vlan1 trunked) goes to port 2 on Mikrotik RB1100AHx4(vlan100-ip addresses 10.107.100.x)port 4 (Dell) goes to another switch (MT crs326 bridged) in another room from there is a cable run across a parking lot connected by a couple MT GEPR to a Netgear passthru switch that feeds 2 ports on stacked Dell fiber switch OOBalso have 2 ports that feed a OOB on a stacked Dell Fiber switch in our main network closet.This replacement of the Dell with a CRS326 feeds also 4 cluster hosted servers. I would like it if the new MT switch can easily work but its not going so easily.

You are making it hard for us as well...Can you please provide the config of the CRS326?Code:Select all/exportfile=anynameyoulikeRemove serial and any other private info and post the result between code tags by using the </> button.Next, please describe all ports of the Dell switch (tagged/untagged/bonded/etc).

First of all why the heck are you paying for and using managed switches if you just have one vlan, aka one flat network.Big waste of money and time configuring................... and even have a second CRS326...............In any case not interested in supporting such a whacko concept, but will provide a hypothetical.Base VLAN or Trusted VLAN  will be vlan11  192.168.11.11/24  coming from RB1100VLA100 will be the HOUSE VLAN and vlan200 will be guest vlan( no idea what cable to OOB  means, so ports not included in example )Best reference:viewtopic.php?t=143620Best vid:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLtGQAQ8iS0&t=77s/interface bridgeadd name=bridge vlan-filtering=no  {change toYESas last step in config}interface ethernetset [ find default-name=ether20 ] name=OffBridge20/interface vlanadd interface=bridge name=vlan11 vlan-id=11  comment="base or trusted subnet from RB1100"/interface listadd name=TRUSTED/interface list membersadd interface=vlan11  list=TRUSTEDadd interface=OffBridge23 list=TRUSTED/ip hotspot profileset [ find default=yes ] html-directory=hotspot/portset 0 name=serial0/interface bridge portadd bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged interface=ether1 comment="trunk from RB1100"add bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged interface=ether2 comment="trunk to second CRS326"add bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admin-only-priority-and-untagged interface=ether10 pvid=100add bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admin-only-priority-and-untagged interface=ether11 pvid=100add bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admin-only-priority-and-untagged interface=ether12 pvid=200add bridge=bridge ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admin-only-priority-and-untagged interface=ether13 pvid=200/ip neighbor discovery-settingsset discover-interface-list=TRUSTED/interface bridge vlanadd bridge=bridge tagged=bridge,ether1,ether2  vlan-ids=11add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2   untagged=ether10,ether11 vlan-ids=100add bridge=bridge tagged=ether1,ether2   untagged=ether12,ether13 vlan-ids=200/ip dhcp-client/ip addressadd address=192.168.11.11 interface=vlan11 network=192.168.11.0  comment="CRS326 address on base vlan"add address=192.168.20.1/30 interface=OffBridge20  network=192.168.20.0/ip dnsset server=192.168.11.1/ip routeadd  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.11.1/ip ne/system identityset name=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/system noteset show-at-login=no/system routerboard settingsset boot-os=router-os enter-setup-on=delete-key/system ntp clientset enabled=yes mode=manycast/system ntp client serversadd address=192.168.11.1/tool mac-serverset allowed-interface-list=none/tool mac-server mac-winboxset allowed-interface-list=TRUSTEDFirst thing, enter config, remove ether20 from bridge, give ether20 a new name and IP address and add to LAN interface list and later to TRUSTED interface list during adjustments.Simply plug laptop into ether20 with IPV4 settings 192.168.20.2  and you can safely configure from there.........Basically all three vlans are created on the RB1100 and flow into CRS326 on a trunk port and all three flow out the trunk port to the next switch presuming both v100 and v200 are required.........Regardless vlan11 is required as all smart devices aka next 326 will get its IP address on vlan11 subnet etc..........

Guess I should have rephrased it from Managed-to-Managed inhouse. We manage all the Dell Switches and Mikrotiks.The OOB means Out-of-Band. Our out of band network is the Vlan 100 from the main router, So this CRS switch will be strictly using the 10.107.100 network on all ports. Sorry if I confused you.The Dell Switch is only using 4 ports on it and it's so old that my boss wants to replace it with a CRS326 and has given me the chore to make it work like the Dell.Anything simple would do. I can draw up a map if that works too of what I'm trying to do.

Not required, all the support I can provide has been given.

port 1 - truck, tagged (vlan1) to port 2 on main routerport 3-39,41-42 (untagged) (41-42 to OOB of fiber switches) Vlan100The default for Mikrotik bridge ports, including the internal bridge-to-CPU port, is VLAN 1 untagged. Many of the default settings do not appear in/exportso this is not immediately obvious.If you have multiple connections between switches for separate regular and OOB management traffic then spanning tree may be blocking ports as you can only have one active link between switches. The default RSTP has no understanding of VLANs so whilst having two links for non-overlapping groups of VLAN IDs would not cause a loop on of the links will be disabled from passing traffic.
