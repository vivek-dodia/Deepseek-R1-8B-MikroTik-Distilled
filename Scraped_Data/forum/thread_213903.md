I have a setup of a Hex RB750Gr3 (7.16.2) and a couple of Unifi UAP AC Pro. The one UAP is connected to a switch that is in ether4 of the hEX, and the other to a switch that is in ether5. Both switches are just dumb ones.If I have two devices on e.g. the upstairs AP and I move on downstairs for one of the devices to roam to the AP downstairs, I will lose connectivity to the other device - I can see how pinging stops to work. After a little while, seemingly random, connectivity suddenly comes back. I've tried with multiple devices and the time it takes varies.If I connect both APs to the same switch, there are no trouble which is why I suspect the router.The config of the hEX is pretty default, I see nothing in the bridge or port config that should be causing issues. ARP config etc. is default:Code:Select all/interfacebridgeaddcomment=defconf name=bridge port-cost-mode=short/interfacelistaddcomment=defconf name=WANaddcomment=defconf name=LAN/interfacebridge portaddbridge=bridge comment=defconf ingress-filtering=nointerface=ether2internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=bridge comment=defconf ingress-filtering=nointerface=ether3internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=bridge comment=defconf ingress-filtering=nointerface=ether4internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=bridge comment=defconf ingress-filtering=nointerface=ether5internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10/ip neighbor discovery-settingssetdiscover-interface-list=LAN/interfacedetect-internetsetdetect-interface-list=all/interfacelist memberaddcomment=defconfinterface=bridge list=LANaddcomment=defconfinterface=ether1 list=WANDoes anyone have any pointer for what I can try to troubleshoot this?

You described using PING in your diagnosis, as you are roaming from one AP to another....Did you PING a local Device or something on the Internet like 8.8.8.8?Secondly, do you see something in the Logfiles of the Router as you are roaming from one AP to another ?

The entire problem is losing connectivity to this device or any other under same circumstance
