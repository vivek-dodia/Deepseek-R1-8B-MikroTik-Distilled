Okay, let's craft some detailed MikroTik RouterOS documentation focusing on user and user group management within an SMB context, targeting version 6.48 and aiming for expert configuration. We'll use the 81.110.7.0/24 subnet and `bridge-40` interface as context.

## Scenario Description:

This configuration aims to demonstrate how to manage users and user groups within a MikroTik router for access control. We'll create user groups with different levels of access rights, assign users to those groups, and explore practical applications of this functionality. Specifically, we will be creating a read-only user group, and a full administrative access user group. This is a common need in SMB where it is typical for different users to have different access rights to the router.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide with MikroTik CLI commands and explanations, alongside equivalent Winbox GUI actions.

**1. Step 1: Initial Router State and Review**

*   **Purpose:** Before we begin, we need to review the initial state of our router. This is best practice and is essential for troubleshooting.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    /user group print
    /interface bridge print
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Go to "Users" in the sidebar, and note any existing users and groups
    *   Go to "Bridge" and note the existence of `bridge-40`

*   **Expected Output:** This will show a list of any current users, user groups, and interfaces. If this is a clean install, you should only see the default `admin` user and the `full` group. You should also see the `bridge-40` interface.

* **Effect:** This action will give you a baseline of the current router state, in particular of the user and group setup.

**2. Step 2: Create a Read-Only User Group**

*   **Purpose:** We'll create a new user group that only has read access. This is common for monitoring or support teams.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group add name=readonly policy=read
    ```
    *   `name=readonly`:  Sets the group name to `readonly`.
    *   `policy=read`: Sets the group's access policy to read-only. This allows users to view the configuration, but not make changes.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Go to "Users" in the sidebar.
    *   Select the "Groups" tab.
    *   Click "Add (+)".
    *   Enter `readonly` for "Name".
    *   Select `read` for "Policy".
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK".

*   **Before Output:**  ` /user group print`  will show only the `full` group.
*   **After Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group print
    Flags   Name     Policy
    0       full     write
    1       readonly read
    ```
*   **Effect:** A new `readonly` group is created with read-only permissions, that can be used to allow users to view, but not modify, the router configuration.

**3. Step 3: Create a Full Access User Group**

*   **Purpose:** We'll create a new user group that has full access. This is ideal for senior technical staff.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group add name=fullaccess policy=write
    ```
    *   `name=fullaccess`: Sets the group name to `fullaccess`.
    *   `policy=write`: Sets the group's access policy to full write and access permissions, which allows users in this group to modify the entire configuration.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Go to "Users" in the sidebar.
    *   Select the "Groups" tab.
    *   Click "Add (+)".
    *   Enter `fullaccess` for "Name".
    *   Select `write` for "Policy".
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK".

*   **Before Output:**  ` /user group print` will show `full` and `readonly`.
*   **After Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group print
    Flags   Name     Policy
    0       full     write
    1       readonly read
    2       fullaccess write
    ```
*   **Effect:** A new `fullaccess` group is created with read and write permissions. This group can be used to grant users total control over the router.

**4. Step 4: Create a Read-Only User**

*   **Purpose:** We create a new user and assign it to the `readonly` group.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=monitor password=securepassword group=readonly
    ```
    *   `name=monitor`: Sets the username to `monitor`.
    *   `password=securepassword`: Sets the user's password. **Note:** Replace `securepassword` with a strong password.
    *   `group=readonly`:  Assigns the user to the `readonly` group.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Go to "Users" in the sidebar.
    *   Select the "Users" tab.
    *   Click "Add (+)".
    *   Enter `monitor` for "Name".
    *   Enter `securepassword` for "Password".
    *   Select `readonly` for "Group".
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK".

*   **Before Output:**  ` /user print`  will show only the `admin` user.
*   **After Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    Flags  Name   Group    Disabled
    0      admin  full     no
    1      monitor readonly no
    ```

*   **Effect:** A new user, `monitor`, is created with read-only access to the router.

**5. Step 5: Create a Full Access User**

*   **Purpose:** We create a new user and assign it to the `fullaccess` group.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=seniortech password=strongpass group=fullaccess
    ```
    *   `name=seniortech`: Sets the username to `seniortech`.
    *   `password=strongpass`: Sets the user's password. **Note:** Replace `strongpass` with a very strong password.
    *   `group=fullaccess`: Assigns the user to the `fullaccess` group.
*   **Winbox GUI:**
    *   Go to "Users" in the sidebar.
    *   Select the "Users" tab.
    *   Click "Add (+)".
    *   Enter `seniortech` for "Name".
    *   Enter `strongpass` for "Password".
    *   Select `fullaccess` for "Group".
    *   Click "Apply" and "OK".

*   **Before Output:**  ` /user print`  will show `admin` and `monitor` user.
*   **After Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    Flags  Name        Group     Disabled
    0      admin       full      no
    1      monitor     readonly  no
    2      seniortech  fullaccess no
    ```
*   **Effect:** A new user, `seniortech`, is created with full access to the router.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the full set of MikroTik CLI commands for this setup:

```mikrotik
/user group add name=readonly policy=read
/user group add name=fullaccess policy=write
/user add name=monitor password=securepassword group=readonly
/user add name=seniortech password=strongpass group=fullaccess
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Incorrect Policy:** Users having more or less access than intended, ensure you use the correct policy to create each user group. Review your settings in `/user group print`
*   **Weak Passwords:** Easily guessable passwords are a major security risk. Always use strong, unique passwords.
*   **Locked Out:** Ensure you have at least one user with full access to recover from misconfigurations.
*   **Resource Consumption:** User authentication itself is not resource-intensive, however, having many users making frequent connections might be. Consider if the user group structure makes sense for your needs and if you need to implement any rate-limiting to reduce load.
*   **Firewall rules for users:** Users do not have firewall rules associated with them, however, they will inherit the general firewall rules. This should be noted as part of any security considerations.
*   **API access:** API access can be controlled via user groups, if you allow API access via `ip service`. Ensure only required users can access the API.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Log in as `monitor`:** Use a Telnet, SSH, or Winbox connection, logging in with the `monitor` user. Observe that you cannot make any changes, and receive error messages. You should still be able to view the full configuration.
2.  **Log in as `seniortech`:** Use a Telnet, SSH, or Winbox connection, logging in with the `seniortech` user. Observe that you can make any changes, and are free to modify the router configuration.
3.  **User Print:** Double check ` /user print` to ensure that users have the correct permissions and are in the correct groups.
4.  **Group Print:** Double check `/user group print` to ensure the user groups have the correct policies.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **User Sessions:**  Monitor user login sessions using `/user active print`. This can be helpful for identifying active users and troubleshooting.
*   **Radius Authentication:** For larger environments, using a RADIUS server for authentication can provide centralized user management. In this configuration, you would not directly create users or groups on the router.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While the MikroTik REST API can be used for user and group management, it's generally less common than using the CLI or Winbox. However, here are some examples:

*   **Get a list of users:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/user`
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Expected Response:**
        ```json
        [
            {
                "name": "admin",
                "group": "full",
                "disabled": false
            },
            {
                "name": "monitor",
                "group": "readonly",
                "disabled": false
            },
            {
                "name": "seniortech",
                "group": "fullaccess",
                "disabled": false
            }
        ]
        ```
*   **Add a user:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/user`
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **Request Payload (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
            "name": "testuser",
            "password": "testpassword",
            "group": "readonly"
        }
        ```
    *   **Expected Response (201 Created):**
        ```json
        {
            "message": "added"
        }
        ```

    *   **Error Handling:** If the username exists already, the response will include an error message:
    ```json
        {
            "message": "already have user with such name"
        }
    ```

    *   If the user group does not exist, the response will include an error message:

    ```json
        {
            "message": "invalid value for argument group: not found"
        }
    ```

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Always grant users only the necessary privileges. In this example, the `readonly` group is vital.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Use a strong and unique password for each user.
*   **Monitor User Activity:** Regularly check user login activity for any unusual patterns.
*   **Secure API Access:** If using the API, make sure access is restricted to only trusted sources, and that TLS is enforced.
*   **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular security audits of user access rights to remove unnecessary or unused accounts.
*   **Disable Default admin account (optional):** Create a new full access user, and disable the admin user (or change its username), this helps to mitigate against default username attacks.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Scalability:** This setup works well for SMB, but for larger setups, a RADIUS server is better.
*   **More granular policies:** We are using the default policies, but you can implement custom policies. This is more difficult and not generally required.
*   **Password policy:** There are no password complexity policies that can be implemented for RouterOS users. Ensure passwords used are strong enough.
*   **Automation:** A script could be used to automate the user creation process, based on the needs of an organisation.
*   **Logging:** Ensure logging is enabled so you can diagnose any user login issues, or other errors.
*   **2FA:** Two factor authentication (2FA) could be used for user logins.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

* **Users:** Users in RouterOS are the entities that can log into the router via different interfaces, such as Telnet, SSH, or Winbox. Each user is assigned a username, password, and a user group. The user groups determine the user's access rights and capabilities within the system.
*   **User Groups:** User groups are collections of users that share the same set of access permissions. Instead of managing access for individual users, which is time-consuming, you can manage user access at the group level. This makes it easy to provide the same access for a number of users at once, and it helps to keep the configuration organized.
*   **Access Policies:** The access policies determine what actions a user or user group can perform. Common policies are `read` (view configuration), `write` (modify configuration), `test` (view and modify configuration, limited), and `api` (access to the RouterOS API).

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

* **Individual users vs groups:** While you *could* manage each user individually by giving individual users specific access permissions, this quickly becomes unmanageable, especially with multiple users. User groups help you to simplify the process and grant users similar permissions all at once.
*   **Built-in vs RADIUS authentication:** The built-in user authentication is ideal for SOHO and SMB environments, where user management is not overly complex. If your organization has a larger infrastructure, RADIUS is generally better because it has better centralized management, and better user access logs.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

*   This documentation is targeted at RouterOS 6.48, but all of these commands are compatible with RouterOS 7.x, and are considered to be "core" functionality.
