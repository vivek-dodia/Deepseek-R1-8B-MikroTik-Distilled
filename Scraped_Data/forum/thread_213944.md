Please help me!I'm a beginner, a few days ago I accidentally checked the deletion of the default configuration.And when I put it back to default, the mikrotik (mANTBox ax 15s) no longer displays the wifi configuration in 2GHz and 5GHz.I restored a backup (by a .backup configuration that I did), but nothing works.Currently, I can't see the configurations of the Channel, bands, etc. Which in my opinion causes me not to be able to see my wifi network on phone or others.Please help me!In PC, a screenshot in /interface/wifi.Please!Sincerely, GaÃ«tan

I sadly don`t have access to a mANTBox ax 15sSo I can not attempt and reproduce the Issue...Nevertheless, I would do another attempt to RESET the DeviceCode:Select all/system/reset-configurationno-defaults=yes skip-backup=yesIf the Issue persist, i would attempt a reinstall via NETInstall

Could this device been compromised?Was it a backup of the identical (or same) device?I would netinstall the device (don't forget both packages):https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... Netinstall

Thank you for your answers!Erilnde > Yes, the backup comes from this mikrotik.After reinstallation by Netinstall the mantbox (os version: 7.16) works a bit because sometimes and when I change the SSID of the wifi, the problem comes back, and I still have to launch my backup. It's going round in circles!

Export config tot txt file, move away from deviceCheck export for completenessNetinstall (yes, again)DON'T restore binary backup, it clearly has some errors in it and you are simply re-importing those.Apply config again block by block via terminal and copy-paste.In case of doubt, post the config here for review (remove private info, serial, passwds ... and please use code quotes when posting).[code] [/code]

I followed the instruction fromHolvoet(that is, to reconfigure Mantbox and not to restore the backups); after checking Mantbox over several days, everything is normal so far.
