**1. Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

- Configure IP pools for dynamically assigning IP addresses to clients on a MikroTik router.
- IP pools should be created for different subnets and should allow for customization of lease time, DNS settings, and gateways.
- The configuration should be robust and handle errors or misconfigurations gracefully.

**2. Step-by-Step Implementation**

**2.1. Create IP Pool for IPv4 Subnet**

```
/ip pool
add name=pool1 range=10.10.10.10-10.10.10.200 comment="IPv4 Pool 1"
```

**2.2. Set DNS Servers and Gateway**

```
/ip pool
set pool1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=10.10.10.1
```

**2.3. Configure Lease Time**

```
/ip pool
set pool1 lease-time=60m comment="Lease time is 60 minutes"
```

**2.4. Repeat for Other Subnets (IPv4 or IPv6)**

Create additional IP pools for different subnets as needed, following the same principles.

**3. Complete Configuration Commands**

- Create IP pool: `/ip pool add name=pool-name range=start-address-end-address`
- Set DNS servers and gateway: `/ip pool set pool-name dns-server=dns-server1,dns-server2 gateway=gateway-address`
- Configure lease time: `/ip pool set pool-name lease-time=lease-duration` (lease-duration in seconds, minutes, hours, or days)

**4. Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

- Ensure that the specified IP range does not overlap with any existing IP addresses or subnets.
- Avoid using IP addresses from reserved ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
- If DNS servers are not specified, clients will not be able to resolve hostnames.
- Ensure that the gateway is a valid IP address within the same subnet as the pool.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

- Check the IP pool configuration: `/ip pool print`
- Assign IP addresses from the pool to clients: `/ip address add address=pool-address/subnet interface=interface-name`
- Verify client IP settings (e.g., `ifconfig` on Linux)
- Test internet connectivity and DNS resolution.

**6. Related Features and Considerations**

- **DHCP Server:** Use the DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses from the pool to clients.
- **Address Lists:** Create address lists to restrict or allow access to certain IP addresses or subnets.
- **Firewall:** Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the pool's IP addresses.
- **MAC Server:** Bind MAC addresses to specific IP addresses within the pool.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

**7.1. Create IP Pool (IPv4)**

**Endpoint:** `/rest/ip/pool`
**Request Method:** POST
**Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "name": "pool1",
  "range": "10.10.10.10-10.10.10.200",
  "dns-server": "8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4",
  "gateway": "10.10.10.1"
}
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "1"
}
```

**7.2. Get IP Pool**

**Endpoint:** `/rest/ip/pool/1`
**Request Method:** GET
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "pool1",
  "range": "10.10.10.10-10.10.10.200",
  "dns-server": "8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4",
  "gateway": "10.10.10.1"
}
```
