Hello,I have the following NAT/Port Forwarding rules and everything works fine when Cloudflare resolves my domain to my public ip. If I route my traffic through Cloudflare proxies, so no more forwarding the traffic directly to my public ip but instead using Cloudflare IPs, I cannot longer reach my network.Code:Select allTheCode:Select alladdress list is just resolving my dynamic ip from my domain (that has a ddns updater).I put that to avoid Hairpin-NAT (because I still don't know how to implement it properly) and that's probably the cause of my problem due the NAT rules seeing that the IP of the request is from an address different from my public one.How can I implement Hairpin-NAT in an easy way and solve my problem?

I've removed theCode:Select alladdress list and set theCode:Select allto my WAN and now it seems to work!
