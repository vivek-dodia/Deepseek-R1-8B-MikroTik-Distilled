I'm not sure if WAN access is expected to work out of the box with back to home? I cannot browse the web on my iPhone when connected via back to home.I see one other topic with a similar problem:viewtopic.php?t=207891But i'm not sure i see the solution to the problem in that thread, maybe i just don't understand the answers correctly.Here's my config:Code:Select all[myuser@MikroTik]>/export# 2024-12-08 18:32:18 by RouterOS 7.16.2# software id = 5TRY-6BL4## model = RB5009UG+S+# serial number = XXX/interfacebridgeaddadmin-mac=48:A9:8A:25:99:6Cauto-mac=nocomment=defconf name=deco port-cost-mode=short/interfacewireguardaddcomment=back-to-home-vpn listen-port=48027mtu=1420name=back-to-home-vpn/interfacelistaddcomment=defconf name=WANaddcomment=defconf name=LAN/interfacewireless security-profilesset[finddefault=yes]supplicant-identity=MikroTik/ip pooladdname=dhcp ranges=192.168.0.2-192.168.0.254/ip dhcp-serveraddaddress-pool=dhcpinterface=deco lease-time=10mname=defconf/ip smb usersset[finddefault=yes]disabled=yes/interfacebridge portaddbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether2internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether3internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether4internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether5internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether6internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether7internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=ether8internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10addbridge=deco comment=defconfinterface=sfp-sfpplus1internal-path-cost=10path-cost=10/ip firewall connection trackingsetudp-timeout=10s/ip neighbor discovery-settingssetdiscover-interface-list=none/ipv6 settingssetdisable-ipv6=yes/interfacelist memberaddcomment=defconfinterface=deco list=LANaddcomment=defconfinterface=ether1 list=WAN/ip addressaddaddress=192.168.0.1/24comment=defconfinterface=deco network=192.168.0.0/ip cloudsetback-to-home-vpn=enabled ddns-enabled=yes ddns-update-interval=10mupdate-time=no/ip cloud back-to-home-usersaddallow-lan=yes comment="iPhone 12"name=RB5009UG+S+private-key="xxx="public-key=\"yyy="/ip dhcp-clientaddcomment=defconfinterface=ether1/ip dhcp-server leaseaddaddress=192.168.0.10client-id=1:98:1:a7:99:6f:cf mac-address=98:01:A7:99:6F:CF server=defconfaddaddress=192.168.0.5client-id=ff:f8:ce:1b:a1:0:2:0:0:ab:11:a3:5f:3b:bf:fe:9c:ba:7fmac-address=00:1E:06:43:D2:C0 server=defconfaddaddress=192.168.0.6client-id=1:0:1e:6:32:92:2fmac-address=00:1E:06:32:92:2Fserver=defconf/ip dhcp-server networkaddaddress=192.168.0.0/24comment=defconf dns-server=192.168.0.1gateway=192.168.0.1netmask=24/ip dnssetallow-remote-requests=yes/ip dnsstaticaddaddress=192.168.0.1comment=defconf name=router.lan type=A/ip firewall address-listaddaddress=192.168.0.2-192.168.0.254list=allowed_to_routeraddaddress=0.0.0.0/8comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=172.16.0.0/12comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=192.168.0.0/16comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=10.0.0.0/8comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=169.254.0.0/16comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=127.0.0.0/8comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=224.0.0.0/4comment=Multicastlist=not_in_internetaddaddress=198.18.0.0/15comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=192.0.0.0/24comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=192.0.2.0/24comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=198.51.100.0/24comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=203.0.113.0/24comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=100.64.0.0/10comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=240.0.0.0/4comment=RFC6890 list=not_in_internetaddaddress=192.88.99.0/24comment="6to4 relay Anycast [RFC 3068]"list=not_in_internetaddaddress=mydomain.net list=cloudflare/ip firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=input comment="default configuration"connection-state=established,relatedaddaction=accept chain=input src-address-list=allowed_to_routeraddaction=accept chain=input protocol=icmpaddaction=drop chain=inputaddaction=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment=FastTrackconnection-state=established,related hw-offload=yesaddaction=accept chain=forward comment="Established, Related"connection-state=established,relatedaddaction=drop chain=forward comment="Drop invalid"connection-state=invalid log=yes log-prefix=invalidaddaction=drop chain=forward comment="Drop tries to reach not public addresses from LAN"dst-address-list=not_in_internetin-interface=\

The  only thing I can suggest is a shot in the dark but its the  only idea I  have.add a firewall address list manually/ip firewall address-listadd IPaddress-peer1    list=back-to-home-lan-restricted-peersadd IPaddress-peer2    list=back-to-home-lan-restricted-peersHowever I do not know what that looks like to actually construct the  address list properlyYou can at least see it by NOT allowing wireguard users access to the LAN and then the router makes this list up dynamically and therefore this address list  show up on a /ip/firewall/address-list printetc....  Then copy it and make it a manually entered rule like above.Then make the following firewall rule./ip firewalladd chain=forward action=accept  src-address-list=back-to-home-lan-restricted-peers  out-interface-list=WAN

Thank you for your suggestion - I tried it it, but it didn't help.I was lucky to get closer to the issue. The wireguard peer2 (which is set dynamically) defaults to having a client DNS address as 192.168.216.1. That can be configured in the iOS app, and when it is changed to 8.8.8.8 i can browse WAN again... But if i set it to 192.168.0.1 (which is what my devices uses when connected on LAN), i get nothing. If i add 192.168.216.1 in WinBox > DNS Settings > Static > Name: router.vpn, Type: A, Value: 192.168.216.1 i also get nothing.I can ofc. just go with 8.8.8.8, but would like the default one to work, if i share the back-to-home with family. Any thoughts on why it seems like i cannot get those addresses to work as DNS servers?

Okay here is the way.On your router make a firewall address list like so/ip firewall address-listadd 192.168.216.2 list=BTH-to-WANadd 192.168.216.3 list=BTH-to-WAN....add 192.168.216.XX list=BTH-to-WAN/ip firewalladd chain=forward action=accept src-address-list=BTH-to-WAN  out-interface-list=WAN

Hmm, not 100% without more inspection....  But I think 192.168.216.0/24 needs to be in the "allowed_to_router" list.

Hmm, not 100% without more inspection....  But I think 192.168.216.0/24 needs to be in the "allowed_to_router" list.That would be for remote user access to the config of the router,  I thought he was asking for access to the LAN subnets......

But I read the OP as internet bound traffic.  I still think it's the firewall,  But I'm not 100% sure myself — I just don't know what line may be dropping BTH traffic since it unclear what path is broken & the non-default "address-list" firewall with hairpin NAT rule make it bit confusing to sort out what's going on.
