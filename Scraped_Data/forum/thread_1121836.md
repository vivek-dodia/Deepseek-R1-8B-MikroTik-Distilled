Hi everyone,I’m using a MikroTik router configured for dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6), and I’d like to monitor WAN traffic. Specifically, I want to track download and upload data separately for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.Has anyone set this up before?Is there a straightforward way to measure these statistics in RouterOS?Can the data be viewed in real-time or stored for historical tracking?Ideally, I’d like to integrate these stats with Home Assistant for visualization on a dashboard.I’d appreciate any advice or recommendations for tools or integrations that can help with this setup.Thanks in advance for your help!

IPv4 and IPv6 firewalls are distinct (already split). Every firewall rule counts the bytes and packets it matches. The GUI interfaces have graphs.
