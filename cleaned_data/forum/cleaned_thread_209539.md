Hi,I try to archive a provisioning different hap ax3 through capsman with different bands per radio (5Gax 5Gac 5Gan and 2Gax, 2Gn). The caps take over the configuration except the correct band. I provision the cap via radio mac and a master slave configuration. But depending on which master configuration I use, it uses the band of the master configuration (seen in current channel and via wifi scanner) not the bands of the slave configurations.Thats my config, I reduced it to the 5G Bands:When I provision the 5G radio, I see unter Wifi the correct bands but unter current channel only the band of the master interface (see attachement):Is there a limitation, what I didnÂ´t find in documentation or in the forum?2nd question, is it still not possible to provision the vlan-id from capsman to the caps (new capsman restriction). Do I still need to configure the vlans manual on the caps. If not could you post me a code with an excample?thx in advance for any support or any new thoughts.Chris

Why do you need that? AX devices are backward compatible with older standards..And yes, it's possible and working fine with AX devices.. ---

Slave config will always follow the physical part of master.That's normal.You can play on slave part with ssid, security, fast transition, ... but not channel nor band, those will be taken from master.As for your second question:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... ionexample: ---

Legacy capsman was able to provide vlan-ids from the capsman, and there was no need to configure it per interface. But when I don't need to configure each band (ac, an and ax), there is no need for so many interfaces.Thx for your help!!!!Chris
