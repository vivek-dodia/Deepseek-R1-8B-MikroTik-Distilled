Hello,Is it possible to run two versions of CAPsMAN on the same router (CCR2004)?My scenario:I have a CCR2004 currently running CAPsMAN Legacy managing 30 access points. I need to integrate new access points (C52iG-5HaxD2HaxD), which require the new version of CAPsMAN.Can I set up a new CAPsMAN instance for the newer version on the same router while keeping the existing CAPsMAN Legacy configuration active and running simultaneously?Best Regards,Carlos Eduardo Diasd

Yes you can.When using ROS version 7.13 or higher, load wireless package as well and you have both environments.
