Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive documentation focusing on IP Pools in MikroTik RouterOS 7.11, targeting an SMB environment with an advanced configuration level. This will be a very extensive guide.

# MikroTik RouterOS: Advanced IP Pool Management for SMBs

## 1. Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

Our scenario involves a small business network with the following requirements:

*   **Multiple VLANs:** We have three VLANs for different departments: `VLAN10` (Marketing), `VLAN20` (Sales), and `VLAN30` (Guest WiFi).
*   **Separate IP Ranges:** Each VLAN needs a distinct private IP range.
*   **Dynamic Addressing:** DHCP server will assign IPs within these pools.
*   **Static Mapping:** We need static IPs for certain critical servers within the Marketing VLAN.
*   **IPv6 Support:** We want to start preparing for IPv6 and allocate IPv6 addresses for each VLAN.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS v7.11 (or 6.x/7.x)
*   Sufficient interfaces for VLAN tagging.
*   Understanding of VLANs and basic bridging on MikroTik.
*   Basic understanding of RouterOS firewall and NAT.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

We'll implement this via CLI primarily for precision. However, equivalent actions in Winbox will be described.

### Step 1: Define IP Pools

We will create pools with descriptive names for both IPv4 and IPv6.

*   **Marketing IPv4 Pool:** `192.168.10.2-192.168.10.254`
*   **Sales IPv4 Pool:** `192.168.20.2-192.168.20.254`
*   **Guest IPv4 Pool:** `192.168.30.2-192.168.30.254`
*   **Marketing IPv6 Pool:** `2001:db8:10::2/64 - 2001:db8:10::ffff/64`
*   **Sales IPv6 Pool:** `2001:db8:20::2/64 - 2001:db8:20::ffff/64`
*   **Guest IPv6 Pool:** `2001:db8:30::2/64 - 2001:db8:30::ffff/64`

**CLI Commands:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=marketing-ipv4 ranges=192.168.10.2-192.168.10.254
add name=sales-ipv4 ranges=192.168.20.2-192.168.20.254
add name=guest-ipv4 ranges=192.168.30.2-192.168.30.254
add name=marketing-ipv6 ranges=2001:db8:10::2-2001:db8:10::ffff
add name=sales-ipv6 ranges=2001:db8:20::2-2001:db8:20::ffff
add name=guest-ipv6 ranges=2001:db8:30::2-2001:db8:30::ffff
```

**Winbox Equivalent:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `Pool`.
*   Click the `+` button to add each pool.
*   Enter the `Name` and `Ranges` in the respective fields.

### Step 2: Define VLAN Interfaces

We'll create VLAN interfaces on a physical interface (e.g., `ether2`).

**CLI Commands:**

```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add interface=ether2 name=vlan10 vlan-id=10
add interface=ether2 name=vlan20 vlan-id=20
add interface=ether2 name=vlan30 vlan-id=30
```

**Winbox Equivalent:**

*   Navigate to `Interface`
*   Click on the blue `+` button
*   Choose "VLAN"
*   Enter the interface name, VLAN ID, and the parent interface

### Step 3: Assign IP Addresses to VLAN Interfaces

We assign IP addresses within the allocated network ranges to each VLAN interface.

**CLI Commands:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=vlan10
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=vlan20
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=vlan30
add address=2001:db8:10::1/64 interface=vlan10
add address=2001:db8:20::1/64 interface=vlan20
add address=2001:db8:30::1/64 interface=vlan30
```

**Winbox Equivalent:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
*   Click the `+` button and add each address with their respective interface.

### Step 4: Configure DHCP Servers

Now we configure DHCP servers for IPv4 and IPv6.  Here we also set the appropriate pools.

**CLI Commands:**

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=marketing-ipv4 disabled=no interface=vlan10 name=dhcp-marketing
add address-pool=sales-ipv4 disabled=no interface=vlan20 name=dhcp-sales
add address-pool=guest-ipv4 disabled=no interface=vlan30 name=dhcp-guest

/ipv6 dhcp-server
add address-pool=marketing-ipv6 disabled=no interface=vlan10 name=dhcpv6-marketing
add address-pool=sales-ipv6 disabled=no interface=vlan20 name=dhcpv6-sales
add address-pool=guest-ipv6 disabled=no interface=vlan30 name=dhcpv6-guest
```

**Winbox Equivalent:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `DHCP Server`
*   Click on the `+` button to add each server.
*   Choose the correct interface and address pool from the dropdown menus.
*   Do the same for IPv6 at `IPv6` -> `DHCP Server`

### Step 5: Configure DHCP Leases for Static IPs

Lets make some static mappings on the marketing DHCP server.

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server lease
add address=192.168.10.10 client-id=00:11:22:33:44:55 mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 server=dhcp-marketing comment="Marketing Server 1"
add address=192.168.10.11 client-id=66:77:88:99:AA:BB mac-address=66:77:88:99:AA:BB server=dhcp-marketing comment="Marketing Server 2"
```

**Winbox Equivalent:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `DHCP Server` -> `Leases`
*   Click on the `+` button and enter the relevant parameters.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

Here is the complete configuration in a single block:

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=marketing-ipv4 ranges=192.168.10.2-192.168.10.254
add name=sales-ipv4 ranges=192.168.20.2-192.168.20.254
add name=guest-ipv4 ranges=192.168.30.2-192.168.30.254

add address-pool=sales-ipv6 disabled=no interface=vlan20 name=dhcpv6-sales
add address-pool=guest-ipv6 disabled=no interface=vlan30 name=dhcpv6-guest

/ip dhcp-server lease
add address=192.168.10.10 client-id=00:11:22:33:44:55 mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 server=dhcp-marketing comment="Marketing Server 1"
add address=192.168.10.11 client-id=66:77:88:99:AA:BB mac-address=66:77:88:99:AA:BB server=dhcp-marketing comment="Marketing Server 2"

```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Incorrect VLAN Tagging:** If VLAN tagging is not set up correctly on your switches, devices may not be able to get an IP address, or be on the wrong VLAN. Check switch configuration first.
*   **DHCP Server Not Starting:** Make sure the `interface` parameter points to the correct VLAN interface and the IP address for the interface is set.
*   **Pool Exhaustion:** If the DHCP server is running out of addresses you might need to extend your pool.
*   **Conflicting IP Addresses:** Make sure your pools are not overlapping with other networks, and that static IPs are outside the DHCP server's dynamic range.
*   **Firewall Issues:** Ensure the firewall is not blocking DHCP requests. If using firewall, ensure that the `forward` chain allows DHCP traffic from your VLAN networks
*   **IPv6 issues:** Ensure that your devices actually support IPv6 and that the router advertises an IPv6 prefix.

**Troubleshooting Tools:**

*   **Log:** Monitor `System -> Log` for any errors or warnings related to DHCP servers, interfaces, or IP pools.
*   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=vlan10` to see what traffic is flowing on a specific VLAN interface. This can help identify if a client is even attempting to get a lease.
*   **Ping:** Use `/ping <IP_address>` to check IP connectivity to the clients.
*   **Packet Sniffer:** `/tool sniffer` can help analyze network traffic in detail, which is invaluable for troubleshooting complex issues

## 5. Verification and Testing

*   **Connect a Device to Each VLAN:** Ensure a client connected to each VLAN receives an IP address from the correct DHCP pool.
*   **Check DHCP Leases:** In `IP -> DHCP Server -> Leases` or `IPv6 -> DHCP Server -> Leases`, verify the leases are assigned correctly.
*   **Ping Test:** Ping the router's VLAN interface IPs from client devices. Also, try pinging between devices on different VLANs (if your firewall allows this)
*   **IPv6 test:** Try to ping an IPv6 address on the same VLAN as the client

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **IP Address Lists:** Use `/ip firewall address-list` to create address lists based on ranges for further filtering or routing.
*   **DHCP Options:** Use `/ip dhcp-server option` to set advanced DHCP options.
*   **IP Bindings:**  `/ip dhcp-server binding` is used for static IP assignments, but note this does not allow setting a static IP based on the client-id (like a lease), only the mac-address.
*   **Subnet Division:** For larger networks, split IP ranges into smaller subnets.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable)

Here are some examples of using the MikroTik API to manage IP pools. Remember to enable API service first under `/ip service` and create an API user.

**API Endpoint:** `/ip/pool`

**Assumptions:**

*   API service enabled
*   Correct authentication headers are sent. (Not covered in this example).
*   For actual testing, a client (like curl or Postman) will be needed with the API credentials

**Example 1: Get all IP Pools**

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** We use VLAN interfaces on top of a physical interface `ether2`. In RouterOS, this doesn't create a 'bridge' in the traditional sense for this scenario. Instead, VLAN interfaces act as logical sub-interfaces on the parent interface, allowing traffic to be tagged and segmented.
*   **Routing:** The router acts as a layer 3 device. It understands the network prefixes assigned to each VLAN interface. It routes traffic based on these IP addresses, and it's able to route between the private networks, and to the public internet via the gateway (Not configured above).
*   **Firewall:** The RouterOS firewall (not configured in this example) is critical for filtering and controlling the flow of traffic between the VLANs and from the network to the internet. It is key to security.

## 9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Always change the default admin password.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services you don't use, such as `telnet`, `ftp`, and the default API.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement robust firewall rules to filter traffic based on source, destination, and ports.
*   **Secure API Access:** Use HTTPS for API access and set strong passwords for API users.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version.
*   **VPN for Management:** Access the router only through a VPN for remote access.
*   **Limit Access to Winbox:** Control who can access Winbox via IP lists or user groups.
*   **Disable Guest WiFi traffic:** Ensure there is a firewall rule to block traffic to the private subnets from the guest network.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples (Detailed Topic List)

Now lets cover all the items listed.  This will be very extensive, so I'll focus on practical and key MikroTik elements.

### IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

*   **IPv4:**  The addresses are in dotted decimal notation. We used `/24` CIDR notation for the subnets, which is standard.
*   **IPv6:**  We used hexadecimal notation. `/64` is standard for IPv6 subnets, which allows for stateless address configuration via Router Advertisements (RA).
*   **DHCP:**  DHCP servers are configured on the interfaces, allowing dynamic assignment of addresses.
*   **Static vs Dynamic:** IPs can be assigned statically by DHCP lease, but note that RouterOS does not support setting static IPs via client-id here, only by mac-address. You can assign static IPs via the `/ip address` command.
*   **Loopback Interface:** RouterOS automatically creates loopback interfaces. Usually named `loopback`. This is useful for testing connectivity.

### IP Pools

*   **Purpose:** Pools define the range of IP addresses that can be allocated by DHCP servers or used for other purposes.
*   **Usage in DHCP:** Pools are associated with DHCP servers to control which addresses will be given out.
*   **Range format:** Must use the start-end format described above.
*   **Next pool:** You can specify a 'next-pool' for overflow, useful in larger deployments.

### IP Routing

*   **Default Routing:** RouterOS has a default routing table. When a new interface or address is added, routerOS will automatically create route entries for each directly connected network.
*   **Static Routes:** We can create static routes using `/ip route add`. For example, to add a static default route to the internet `add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.88.1`.
*   **Dynamic Routing Protocols:** RouterOS supports OSPF, RIP, and BGP protocols.
*   **Policy Routing:** Used for complex routing scenarios where routes are chosen based on packet properties (e.g. source addresses). `/ip route rule`
*   **VRF:** Virtual Routing and Forwarding can create multiple routing tables for different services or virtual networks `/routing vrf`

### IP Settings

*   **Global Settings:** Control general IP parameters like TCP settings, SYN timeouts, and proxy ARP `/ip settings`.
*   **Fast Track:** This is a RouterOS feature that bypasses the traditional firewall flow, speeding up connections for faster traffic throughput, especially useful in firewalls. `/ip settings set fasttrack-connection=yes`
*   **ICMP Settings:** You can change the behavior of ICMP handling in the router, such as rate limits, timeouts, and the response type `/ip settings icmp`

### MAC server

*   **Purpose:** Allows MikroTik routers to respond to broadcast requests for an IP address.
*   **Configuration:** Located in `/tool mac-server`, allowing you to configure the interfaces for the mac server and add static mac entries.
*   **Use Case:** Useful for managing devices that might not have a DHCP client, such as some specific industrial equipment.

### RoMON

*   **Purpose:** RoMON is RouterOS's proprietary remote monitoring tool. It can discover other Mikrotik devices and access them through their mac address.
*   **Setup:**  Activated via `/tool romon set enabled=yes`, it can automatically discover other routers in your network with the same RoMON ID and password.
*   **Use Case:** Allows easier remote management over other non-IP layer networks, which can be crucial for managing routers without IP addresses in the main network.
*   **Security:** Requires a password to ensure only authorized routers connect.

### WinBox

*   **GUI Interface:** Winbox is the standard GUI client for MikroTik.
*   **Access:** Can access routers by IP or MAC address.
*   **Capabilities:** Most RouterOS functions are accessible from Winbox.
*   **Security:** Secure via secure connection. Use an IP access list `/ip service` to allow Winbox only from specific locations, which can be useful for security.

### Certificates

*   **Purpose:** To secure communication with the MikroTik device via HTTPS, TLS, VPNs, or other secure protocols.
*   **Self-Signed Certificates:** Can generate self-signed certificates `/certificate add name=self-signed common-name=router-ip ca=no`
*   **CA Certificates:** Import and use certificates signed by a Certificate Authority. `/certificate import file=cert.pem`
*   **SSL Termination:** Use for SSL termination with services like web proxies.
*   **Management:**  Certificates can be viewed in `/certificate`

### PPP AAA

*   **Purpose:** Used for point-to-point connections for user authentication, using `PPP secrets`.
*   **Authentication Methods:** PAP, CHAP, MSCHAP.
*   **Use Case:** Common in PPPoE (DSL) connections, PPTP, and L2TP VPNs.
*   **Configuration:** Settings under `/ppp profile` and `/ppp secret`.

### RADIUS

*   **Purpose:** Centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for network access.
*   **Configuration:**  Defined under `/radius` specifying server, port, and secret.
*   **Use Case:** Commonly used for Wi-Fi networks or VPNs in larger deployments, or in enterprise networks.
*   **Benefits:** Allows granular control of user access and accounting.
*   **Integration:** Can be used in combination with PPP AAA.

### User / User groups

*   **User management:** `/user` defines the user accounts.
*   **Groups:** `/user group` defines groups to assign permissions.
*   **Permissions:** Each group has a list of permissions.
*   **Security:** Essential for limiting access to your router.
*   **Best practices:** Create multiple accounts with different permission sets based on the needs of the admin role.

### Bridging and Switching

*   **Bridging:** Connect multiple physical interfaces into one logical interface. Useful for LAN setups. Use the `/interface bridge` menu. Note, for this example, we did not use bridging, we simply used VLANs on the interface.
*   **Switching:** Most MikroTik routers have switch chips that offload switching to hardware. This is controlled through `/interface ethernet switch`.
*   **VLAN Tagging:**  VLAN tagging can be configured on bridge ports or directly on interfaces. `/interface vlan`.
*   **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):** Useful in bridged network with multiple links to avoid loops, enabled with `/interface bridge stp`.

### MACVLAN

*   **Purpose:** Create multiple logical interfaces from a single physical interface with different MAC addresses.
*   **Use Case:** Useful for having multiple independent interfaces on the same physical port.
*   **Configuration:** `/interface macvlan add interface=ether2 mac-address=02:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`

### L3 Hardware Offloading

*   **Purpose:** Improve performance by offloading packet processing to hardware.
*   **Features:**  Usually done by the switch chip, such as IP routing, NAT, firewall, QoS, and other features.
*   **Configuration:** Usually enabled by default, with limited controls available.
*   **Benefit:** Significant performance improvement.
*   **Verification:** `/interface ethernet monitor <interface>` to see if L3 offloading is enabled.

### MACsec

*   **Purpose:** Encrypt traffic at Layer 2 to provide security and privacy.
*   **Use Cases:**  Securing links between devices in an enterprise or industrial network.
*   **Configuration:** Under `/interface ethernet macsec`, defining policies, keys, and associations.
*   **Compatibility:** Not supported on all MikroTik devices.

### Quality of Service

*   **Queues:** `/queue` is used to manage traffic priorities.  Simple queues, PCQ queues, and queue trees.
*   **Shaping:** Limit the bandwidth of a connection.
*   **Prioritization:** Give preference to certain types of traffic.
*   **Use Cases:** Essential for managing bandwidth in busy networks, such as prioritizing voice over data.
*   **Configuration:**  Set up rules to match different types of traffic and set their priority, bandwidth, or delay.
*   **Traffic classification:** Classification of traffic can use `mangle` under the `/ip firewall mangle` menu

### Switch Chip Features

*   **VLANs:** Hardware VLAN tagging on supported devices. `/interface ethernet switch vlan`
*   **Port Mirroring:** Mirror traffic from one port to another for monitoring.
*   **Link Aggregation:** Combine multiple links for increased bandwidth. Not to be confused with bonding, this is usually vendor specific on the hardware.

### VLAN

*   **Purpose:** To segment a network into smaller logical broadcast domains.
*   **Use Cases:** Separate departments, guest networks, DMZs.
*   **Configuration:** Done using the `/interface vlan` command and setting a vlan-id.
*   **Best Practices:** Use VLANs with tag awareness on switches.

### VXLAN

*   **Purpose:**  Layer 2 overlay network over IP to connect networks over the internet.
*   **Use Cases:** Extension of LANs over wide areas, especially in clouds.
*   **Configuration:** Uses `/interface vxlan` to define the VXLAN parameters such as VNI, source address, and destination.
*   **Limitations:** Can be complex to set up and debug.
*   **VPN:** VXLAN can be used to create encrypted tunnels.

### Firewall and Quality of Service

#### Connection tracking

*   **Purpose:** Tracks the state of network connections, both TCP and UDP.
*   **Usage:** Used by the firewall to make decisions.
*   **Configuration:** Managed under `/ip firewall connection tracking`, with settings like timeouts for connections.
*   **Best Practices:** Connection tracking should always be enabled, otherwise the firewall will be much less effective.

#### Firewall

*   **Functionality:** Filters traffic based on predefined rules `/ip firewall filter`, `/ipv6 firewall filter`
*   **Chains:**  `input`, `output`, and `forward` are the key chains.
*   **Rules:** Rules match packets based on their header information and can perform actions such as accepting, dropping, logging, or marking traffic.
*   **NAT:** Network Address Translation, to convert private IPs to public IPs `/ip firewall nat`
*   **Mangle:** Manipulates the header of the packet before reaching the filter and NAT rules, useful for QoS, policy routing, and more `/ip firewall mangle`.
*   **Best Practices:** Create a default drop rule at the end of your rules for all chains.
*   **Security:** Proper firewall rules are essential to protect your network.

#### Packet Flow in RouterOS

*   **Diagram:**  Understanding the flow from input, through the firewall to output is essential.
*   **Order of operations:** Order of rules and chains is critical.
*   **Optimization:** Avoid overly complex rules that might negatively impact the performance.
*   **Debugging:** Use the `/tool torch` to view packets and the `/log` to view the result of your firewall rules.

#### Queues

*   **Queue Types:**  Simple queues, PCQ queues, and queue trees, all under `/queue`
*   **Shaping and Prioritization:**  Essential for bandwidth control.
*   **Implementation:**  Set up rules to match different types of traffic.
*   **Hierarchical Queues:** Complex queue setups can be arranged in trees.
*   **Best Practices:** Don't overcomplicate the system to avoid performance issues.

#### Firewall and QoS Case Studies

*   **Prioritizing VoIP:** Create queues to give VoIP packets priority.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Limit bandwidth for certain applications or users.
*   **Blocking P2P:** Use `layer7` protocols and address lists to block P2P traffic.
*   **Specific examples:** Consider common scenarios in a real network to implement effective firewall and QoS policies.

#### Kid Control

*   **Purpose:**  Filtering content and limiting access to the internet for children `/ip firewall layer7-protocol` or using the `/ip firewall address-list` to block certain addresses.
*   **Implementation:** Can be done using time-based rules or blocking certain categories of websites.
*   **Limitations:** Can be bypassed using a VPN or by using private DNS resolvers
*   **Best practices:** Use web filtering based on domain name or IP address.

#### UPnP and NAT-PMP

*   **Purpose:**  Allow applications to automatically forward ports to your router.
*   **Configuration:** Enabled and disabled in `/ip upnp`, `/ip nat-pmp`.
*   **Security Concerns:** Can be a security risk if not properly configured as ports can be open by applications you do not trust.
*   **Best Practices:** Enable only if you need it and understand the risks.

### IP Services (DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy)

#### DHCP

*   **DHCP Server Configuration:** Done using `/ip dhcp-server`.
*   **DHCP Client:**  The client is managed under `/ip dhcp-client`
*   **Leases:** View current leases using `/ip dhcp-server lease`.
*   **Static Assignments:** Use DHCP leases or bindings to assign static IPs.
*   **DHCP Options:** Can be used to provide extra information to DHCP clients (DNS servers, domain names) using `/ip dhcp-server option`.

#### DNS

*   **DNS Server Settings:**  Controlled under `/ip dns`.
*   **DNS Cache:** RouterOS can cache DNS queries.
*   **Static DNS entries:** Use `/ip dns static` for adding your own specific entries
*   **Remote Servers:**  Configure remote DNS servers under the `servers` parameter.
*   **Security:**  Ensure DNS is configured with secure servers.

#### SOCKS

*   **Purpose:** A proxy server that can be used to route traffic through another server.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip socks` set the interface to listen to.
*   **Use Cases:**  Used in environments where traffic needs to be routed via an external proxy server.
*   **Security:** Can pose a security threat, especially if left with the default open configurations.

#### Proxy

*   **Purpose:** To provide caching and filtering of HTTP requests. `/ip proxy`
*   **Configuration:** Set the port to listen to and other parameters such as access control, caching, and other options.
*   **Use Cases:**  Can be used to improve web page access, or block malicious sites.
*   **Security:** Must be secured and require authentication for use

### High Availability Solutions

#### Load Balancing

*   **Purpose:** Distribute traffic across multiple paths.
*   **Methods:**  Can use equal cost multi-path routing, ECMP, or policy-based routing.
*   **Configuration:** Requires appropriate routes and firewall rules.
*   **Use Cases:** Load balancing between multiple internet connections.

#### Bonding

*   **Purpose:**  Combine multiple physical links to act as one.
*   **Modes:** `802.3ad` , `balance-rr` , `balance-xor`
*   **Use Cases:** Increasing link speed or providing link redundancy, usually on local network
*   **Configuration:** `/interface bonding`. Requires compatible switches.

#### Bonding Examples

*   **Link Redundancy:** Configure bonding with active-backup mode.
*   **Increased Bandwidth:** Combine multiple ethernet links with the `802.3ad` protocol.

#### HA Case Studies

*   **Failover:** Set up VRRP for router failover.
*   **Load Sharing:** Implement load balancing across multiple routers.
*   **Complex Setups:** Combine bonding, VRRP, and routing protocols for HA.

#### Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group

*   **Purpose:** Extends link aggregation across multiple physical chassis for redundancy.
*   **Complexity:** Requires a deep understanding of networking.
*   **Use Cases:** Usually used in larger datacenter and carrier-grade deployments.

#### VRRP

*   **Purpose:** Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol provides router redundancy by allowing one router to act as a master, and another as a backup.
*   **Configuration:** Configured under `/interface vrrp` and each device requires a virtual IP address.
*   **Use Cases:** Essential for high-availability of critical routers.

#### VRRP Configuration Examples

*   **Master/Backup:** Configure one router as the primary, the other as secondary.
*   **Priority:** Adjust priorities to influence the election of the master.
*   **Preemption:** Set if a higher-priority router automatically becomes a master, or not.

### Mobile Networking

#### GPS

*   **Purpose:** Obtain GPS coordinates for location-based services.
*   **Supported Devices:** RouterBOARD with built-in GPS modules.
*   **Configuration:** Using `/system gps`
*   **Use Cases:**  Location tracking in transportation or remote monitoring.
*   **API:** Allows fetching GPS data via MikroTik API.

#### LTE

*   **Purpose:** Connect to cellular networks via LTE modems
