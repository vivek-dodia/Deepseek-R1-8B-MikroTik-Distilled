Okay, let's dive into configuring RADIUS authentication on a MikroTik router (RouterOS 6.48) for a basic point-to-point link. We'll use the provided subnet and interface, focusing on practical implementation and addressing potential issues. This configuration will be at the "Basic" level, suitable for most users familiar with MikroTik basics.

## Scenario Description:

We will configure a MikroTik router to act as a RADIUS client. This router will authenticate users (though in this basic setup, we will demonstrate a user, *testuser*, being authenticated on the router) via a RADIUS server. This is a fundamental part of more complex setups like Wi-Fi hotspots, VPN servers, or even PPPoE servers. In our simplified case, we'll illustrate how to configure the RADIUS client functionality on the router connected to the interface `ether2`, although this interface is *not* necessarily *where* authentication occurs. The specific type of authentication is not the primary focus, just the client-side configuration necessary for such authentication to be completed.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring RADIUS on the MikroTik router:

### 1. **Step 1: Verify Connectivity (Optional but recommended)**

*   **Purpose:** Before we start, let's make sure our interface (`ether2`) has basic IP connectivity. This helps isolate issues later on. The goal here is *not* to configure anything, just to see if there are any immediate problems.
*   **Before:** We assume there might be nothing configured on ether2.
*   **Action:** Ping the gateway for the network. We will configure an IP on ether2 in a later step, but for this step, assume we have an IP. We will use 200.191.115.10/24 for the test IP. We are assuming the other device connected to ether-2 has IP address of 200.191.115.1.

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 200.191.115.1
    ```
*   **After:** If the ping is successful, we have a basic network connection, which can be beneficial in troubleshooting problems with RADIUS. If the ping is unsuccessful, then we must troubleshoot that problem before proceeding.

### 2. **Step 2: Configure the Interface IP Address**

*   **Purpose:** Assign an IP address to `ether2` so the router can communicate on the network.
*   **Before:** `ether2` might not have any IP configured.
*   **Action (CLI):**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=200.191.115.10/24 interface=ether2
    ```
*   **Action (Winbox):**
    *   Go to IP -> Addresses.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   Enter `200.191.115.10/24` in the "Address" field.
    *   Select `ether2` from the "Interface" dropdown.
    *   Click "Apply" then "OK".
*   **After:** `ether2` now has the IP address `200.191.115.10/24`

### 3. **Step 3: Add RADIUS Server Configuration**

*   **Purpose:** Specify the RADIUS server's IP address, secret, and port.
*   **Before:** No RADIUS server configuration is present.
*   **Action (CLI):** Replace `192.168.88.100` with your RADIUS server IP address and `MySecret` with your RADIUS secret.
    ```mikrotik
    /radius add address=192.168.88.100 secret=MySecret service=ppp,login,hotspot,dhcp,wireless
    ```

    **Parameter Details:**
    | Parameter | Description | Example |
    |---|---|---|
    | `address` | The IP address of the RADIUS server. | `192.168.88.100` |
    | `secret` | The shared secret configured on the RADIUS server. | `MySecret` |
    | `service` | Which services should use this RADIUS server for authentication. | `ppp,login,hotspot,dhcp,wireless` |

*   **Action (Winbox):**
    *   Go to RADIUS in the main menu.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   Enter `192.168.88.100` in the "Address" field.
    *   Enter your RADIUS secret in the "Secret" field.
    *   Check boxes for `ppp`, `login`, `hotspot`, `dhcp`, and `wireless` under services.
    *   Click "Apply" then "OK".
*   **After:** The router now knows the RADIUS server's address and secret.

    **Note**: For a basic setup, services such as `ppp`, `hotspot`, `dhcp`, and `wireless` are included, even if they might not be used in this point-to-point example.  This ensures flexibility if those services are introduced in the future. If this router was intended only as a pure point-to-point link, only login would be needed.

### 4. **Step 4: Enable System User RADIUS Authentication (for testing)**

*   **Purpose:** Configure the router to use RADIUS for local user authentication. This is purely for demonstration purposes to verify the RADIUS configuration.  This can be useful for testing a RADIUS server's configuration without needing a fully functioning system. This can be dangerous, and should be disabled once testing has been completed.
*   **Before:** Local users authenticate using the router's internal database only.
*   **Action (CLI):**
   ```mikrotik
    /user set use-radius=yes
    ```
*   **Action (Winbox):**
    * Go to `/Users`
    * Click on the `Use Radius` box at the top. This will set it to yes.
*   **After:** The router will now attempt to authenticate local users using the configured RADIUS server.

**Note:** This step can lock you out of your router if the RADIUS server is misconfigured or unreachable. Always have a safe way to access the router (like console access, or a second user configured locally, *before* enabling use of RADIUS for all users.)

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here are all the commands combined for easy copy-pasting:

```mikrotik
/ip address add address=200.191.115.10/24 interface=ether2
/radius add address=192.168.88.100 secret=MySecret service=ppp,login,hotspot,dhcp,wireless
/user set use-radius=yes
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Incorrect Secret:** The most common issue is an incorrect secret on the router or RADIUS server. Double-check your secret on both devices.
    *   **Solution:** Verify both the secret on the MikroTik and the RADIUS server.
*   **RADIUS Server Unreachable:** If the router cannot reach the RADIUS server, authentication will fail.
    *   **Solution:** Use `ping` to ensure IP connectivity to the RADIUS server, and also verify any firewalls or other network configurations that might be blocking traffic.
*   **Firewall Issues:**  MikroTik firewall may block RADIUS traffic. By default UDP port 1812 must be allowed out from the router.
    *   **Solution:** Create a firewall rule to allow traffic to the RADIUS server on port 1812 (UDP). Check your default firewall, which may allow everything.
*   **Incorrect Service Selection**: If you have the wrong service selected in the radius configuration, the authentication will not function properly.
   *  **Solution**: Verify all services that you intend to use the RADIUS server for are checked on the RADIUS configuration.
*  **High Resource Utilization:** Using RADIUS authentication does add a small amount of load to the system for every authentication. On high-utilization environments this may cause problems on the device.
    *   **Solution**: Verify the amount of authentication attempts, and upgrade the router if necessary.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Check RADIUS Logs:** Look at the MikroTik logs for RADIUS-related messages.

    ```mikrotik
    /log print follow-lines=10 where topics~"radius"
    ```

    *   **Success:** Look for log entries indicating successful communication with the RADIUS server.
    *   **Failure:** Look for log entries with "timeout" or "connection refused" messages. These point to network problems or incorrect server configuration.

2.  **Attempt a user login through a CLI window (or WinBox):** If you enter incorrect information, the login will fail. If the user is valid and RADIUS is properly configured, you will login with the credentials used. If the login does not work, then the RADIUS server or setup is misconfigured.

3.  **Use Torch (for network debugging)**: Torch can monitor UDP traffic on port 1812, helping to verify if the MikroTik is sending RADIUS requests to the server, and if the server is responding.
    * Run the command `/tool torch interface=ether2 port=1812`
    * Check if the router sends UDP traffic to the radius server (specified in step 3), and that the radius server responds.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Accounting:** RADIUS also supports accounting (start, stop, and interim accounting). This feature could be configured for a hotspot environment or other high-traffic environments for tracking resource utilization.
*   **Multiple RADIUS Servers:**  You can configure multiple RADIUS servers for redundancy, where requests are sent to a backup RADIUS server in the event that the primary server is unavailable.
*   **Different RADIUS Protocols:** While we're only using basic RADIUS over UDP, other protocols may be implemented on the server, so that the server is accessible via multiple clients, including, but not limited to, multiple MikroTiks.
*   **Authentication Types**: This configuration uses a basic authentication type. However, RADIUS supports other authentication methods such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, etc. which may require further configuration on the server-side and client-side.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While many aspects of MikroTik are configured via the API, enabling RADIUS functionality on MikroTik is most effective using the CLI or WinBox. However, the following examples are helpful for automating the configurations if they should be re-applied to multiple devices. Here's an example of adding a RADIUS server using the API:

**API Endpoint:** `/radius`

**Request Method:** POST

**JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "address": "192.168.88.100",
  "secret": "MySecret",
  "service": "ppp,login,hotspot,dhcp,wireless",
  "timeout": "3s"
}
```

**Response (Success):**

```json
{
  ".id": "*1",
  "address": "192.168.88.100",
  "secret": "MySecret",
  "service": "ppp,login,hotspot,dhcp,wireless",
  "timeout": "3s"
}
```

**Response (Error):**

```json
{
    "message": "invalid value for argument address",
    "error": true
}
```

**Error Handling:**
The error code and `message` are specific to the type of error returned. In this instance, an invalid address, such as `127.0.0.1` would return the above error. A complete list of API specific errors can be found in MikroTik's official documentation. The error response will always return an `error` field as either `true` or `false`, and will return a `message` field explaining the nature of the error. These fields must be parsed in order to understand any problems arising from the request.

**Important Considerations**

*   **MikroTik API:**  The MikroTik API is powerful, but it requires a good understanding of the API's structure and conventions. Please refer to the official documentation for specific parameters and usage.
*   **Authentication:** You'll need to provide valid user credentials for the MikroTik API when making requests.
*  **API Parameter Values** Values for API parameter fields are case sensitive, and must be properly enclosed in quotes.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Strong Secrets:** Use a long, complex, and randomly generated secret for your RADIUS server.
*   **Restrict Access:** Allow RADIUS communication only from trusted devices using firewall rules.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review RADIUS server logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Secure RADIUS Server:** Harden your RADIUS server to protect against vulnerabilities.
*   **Disable Default Users:** When using RADIUS for all users, remove the default users on the router. The user `admin` on a default router is a security vulnerability. Ensure the password for your user on the RADIUS server is very strong.
*   **Limit RADIUS Services:** Only enable RADIUS services that are required. Over enabling services will lead to performance and security issues.
*   **Local Backup User:** Ensure that there is a backup local login user configured in case of problems arising from RADIUS.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Lack of Real-World Authentication:** This basic configuration is more of a demonstration of the client functionality, than a full-fledged setup for a working RADIUS server. The next step would be to configure a real service such as a hotspot, or PPP to use the RADIUS server.
*   **No Accounting:** A real production environment would use accounting in addition to authentication.
*  **Single server:** This implementation uses a single server. The next best step would be to add additional servers for redundancy and reliability.
*   **Basic Security:** The firewall configuration is basic. For a production device the rules should be more restrictive and include additional safeguards.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

**RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):**

RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users accessing a network or network resources. It operates on a client-server model:

*   **Client:**  In our case, the MikroTik router. The client requests the server to check credentials, using a shared secret.
*   **Server:** A dedicated server that stores user credentials, policies, and accounting information.

The MikroTik router sends authentication requests to the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server verifies the information against its database and responds with the authorization details for the client (router). RADIUS is a widely used standard in network access, VPNs, and hotspots.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Centralized vs. Decentralized Authentication:** RADIUS provides a centralized approach. Instead of having user accounts stored locally on each device, the router will use the credentials from a centralized RADIUS server. The trade off is an additional network hop when authentication is performed. However, the centralization provides superior security control, and an easier administration process for a large network. Local authentication is only preferred for small networks.
*   **Performance:**  RADIUS requests require a round trip to an external server. In small to medium sized networks this performance difference is negligible, however in large scale networks the overhead will be noticeable and may be a serious problem if the server is not performing well, and can lead to user experience problems, particularly on wireless access points, or PPPoE.
*  **Complexity:** Implementing RADIUS does add complexity to the system, particularly in configuration of both the RADIUS server, and all client-side implementations. However this is a worthwhile tradeoff for the benefits in scalability and security that it provides.
*  **Security** Using RADIUS is more secure than relying on the local database.  It provides a centralized management system that prevents unauthorized access, allows for greater password security measures, and easier user management.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration targets RouterOS 6.48 and is also compatible with RouterOS 7.x. The commands used are standard across these versions. Specific commands such as `user set use-radius=yes` are not available on all previous versions of RouterOS, but have been available for many versions of the software. If you are using a very old version of RouterOS, consult the documentation for that version.

This detailed documentation should provide a strong foundation for implementing RADIUS on your MikroTik router. Remember to test and monitor your setup carefully.  Always consult MikroTik's official documentation for the most up-to-date information. Good luck!
