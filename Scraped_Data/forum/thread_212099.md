HiI have some strange problem in my LAN.I have a hAP axÂ³ as router and CAPSMAN and a cAP AX on port2 as a CAP. When my phone roam from wifi5-BerniLAN (on hap, and with 192.168.10.x IP, VLAN10) to cAP-5AX, it assigns a 10.0.0.x IP that's VLAN1. If I swith off wifi on phone and switch on, it connect tot cAP-5AX and it takes the correct IP from VLAN 10log.pngTo explain my LAN:- VLANs:-- VLAN1 management 10.0.0.0/24-- VLAN10 PC and phone 192.168.10.0/24-- VLAN20 IOT 192.168.20.0/24-- VLAN30 DMZ for IOT that needs internet 192.168.30.0/24Devices:- hAP AX3:-- eth1: WAN-- eth2: cAP AX (trunk)-- eth3: server (trunk)-- eth4: laptop-- eth5: IOT-- wifi2-BerniLAN: vlan10  2.4G-- wifi5-BerniLAN: vlan20  5GThat device have CAPSMAN enabled and configured- cAP AX on CAPS mode-Wifis:-- BerniLAN: vlan10-- BerniLAN-IOT: vlan20-- BerniLAN-DMZ: vlan30I attach the export off hAP (I have removed non important information like address-list and firewall configuration)Anyone know whats happening?thanks!

Don't use VLAN ID 1, this can cause (these kind of) problems.Check all asterikses, especially on /interface list member.Internet detect can cause strange problems, probably not related (but turn it off anyway).On /interface bridge port, set frame-types:Access ports - frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-taggedHybrid ports - frame-types=admit-allTrunk ports - frame-types=admit-only-vlan-taggedAn excellent guide on VLAN:viewtopic.php?t=143620

Hi!Thanks erlinden for the suggestions. I have been developing a small LAB to test your suggestions and reading the vlan guide, and latter I put it on "production". I think that now is correct (more or less, I will explain), and now DHCP over roaming works ok. Buuuutttt, now I found a new error/problem...this is the new configuractionexport.rscWhen I don't configure VLAN security, and ports filter is "admit-all", CAPsMAN works well; CAPS appears on Remote CAP tab, provisiong work web... but, if I config trunk ports with "admit-only-vlan-tagged", CAP disappear. It's strange because on bridge > ports all vlans are tagged on trunk ports and there aren't vlan untagged.First off all I try with the configuration by "reset in CAPs mode", and it doesn't work with "only-tagged", but it work with "admit all". And latter I try configuring CAP with a bridge, with vlans, tagged on ether1 and vlan-filtering, and result is de same (OK with admit all, KO with only tagged).Can anyone explain me the reason o the solution?Thanks to all!

```
Code:Select all/interface bridge

/interface vlan
add interface=bridgeLocal name=vlan99_base vlan-id=99
/interface wifi datapath

```

```
Code:Select all/interface wifi capsman
set enabled=yes interfaces=vlan99_base package-path="" require-peer-certificate=no \
    upgrade-policy=none
```

Do some manual VLAN filtering on the CAP, like this:This way, you use vlan99_base for CAPsMAN communication (on CAPsMAN):

HiFinally I think that all works ok. Thanks @erlinden for your support.Just an appreciation for someone who is fighting with CAPSMAN, its important that wifi interfaces aren't on the bridge. If I put wifi1 on bridge, CAPSMAN configure all interfaces, but the master doesn't work, you can connect to the master but it doesn't have connectivity. The slaves configuration works ok and have connectivity.Thanks!
