Not totally true.  I only receive sms messages if I "set receive-enabled=n ; set receive-enabled=y "If I just have "receive-enabled=y" nothing happens when a new message is sent to it's phone #.  Only when I turn it off then back on do I receive pending messages.Anyone else with this issue or have a fix??Running: 6.44.3

Thank you for your post. I have the exact same issue with the Chateau LTE6 ax. For me, disabling and then re-enabling SMS reception also results in receiving messages. Unfortunately, I don't believe anyone from MikroTik reads this forum or cares about software bugs.

I use this on my SXT LTE6 DeviceThis is how I have got round it.1/ Create System Script to Disable then Re-enable the SMS Receiving2/ Setup Schedule (SMS-Reset) to run at boot and subsequently every 5 mins thereafterCode:Select all/system scriptadddont-require-permissions=noname=sms-reset owner=admin policy=\
ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source="#\ this is required to receive SMS messages as bug found\r\
\n/tool sms set receive-enabled=no port=lte1 \r\
\n:delay 2s\r\
\n/tool sms set receive-enabled=yes port=lte1 secret=MySecret\r\
\n:delay 2s\r\
\n"Code:Select all/system scheduleraddinterval=5mname=SMS-Reseton-event=sms-reset policy=\
ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon \
start-time=startupNot ideal, but it works.

The error still persists, RB will not accept sms. A simple script to scheduler for 10sec is enoughCode:Select all/tool smssetreceive-enabled=no:delay2s/tool smssetreceive-enabled=yes
