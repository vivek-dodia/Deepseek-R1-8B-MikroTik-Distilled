I`ve made this scenario several times but I have a big problem in this site.RB3011 as a GW, 2 fiber lines 1Gb/s.1st fiber line as solo working properly (speed over 500Mb/s)2nd fiber line as solo working properly (speed over 500Mb/s).This is my setup.[admin@GW] > ip ro print detailFlags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic,C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme,B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit0 A S  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.111.1gateway-status=192.168.111.1 reachable via  ether8 distance=2 scope=30target-scope=10 routing-mark=Orange-K1 ADS  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.110.1gateway-status=192.168.110.1 reachable via  ether9 distance=1 scope=30target-scope=10 vrf-interface=ether92 ADC  dst-address=10.1.1.247/32 pref-src=10.1.1.248 gateway=<pptp-fleg>gateway-status=<pptp-fleg> reachable distance=0 scope=103 ADC  dst-address=10.10.0.0/24 pref-src=10.10.0.0 gateway=bridgegateway-status=bridge reachable distance=0 scope=104 A S  ;;; Test_via_server _roomdst-address=92.240.xxx.xx/32 gateway=192.168.111.1gateway-status=192.168.111.1 reachable via  ether8 distance=1 scope=30target-scope=105 ADC  dst-address=192.168.100.0/22 pref-src=192.168.100.1 gateway=bridgegateway-status=bridge reachable distance=0 scope=106 ADC  dst-address=192.168.110.0/24 pref-src=192.168.110.3 gateway=ether9gateway-status=ether9 reachable distance=0 scope=107 ADC  dst-address=192.168.111.0/24 pref-src=192.168.111.3 gateway=ether8gateway-status=ether8 reachable distance=0 scope=108 ADC  dst-address=192.168.200.0/23 pref-src=192.168.200.1 gateway=bridgegateway-status=bridge reachable distance=0 scope=10This is my mangle setup.[admin@GW] > ip firewall mangle printFlags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic0  D ;;; special dummy rule to show fasttrack counterschain=prerouting action=passthrough1  D ;;; special dummy rule to show fasttrack counterschain=forward action=passthrough2  D ;;; special dummy rule to show fasttrack counterschain=postrouting action=passthrough3 X  chain=prerouting action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=Orange-K passthrough=yes src-address=192.168.100.92 dst-address=!192.168.100.0/22 log=no log-prefix=""4    chain=prerouting action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=Orange-K passthrough=yes src-address=192.168.100.3 dst-address=!192.168.100.0/22 log=no log-prefix=""If is there a rule no.4 active internet is about 100kb/s via Orange-K marked gw, if is deactivated there is over 500Mb/s via main gw.If i turn off main route via 192.168.110.1 and route via 192.168.111.1 (marked as Orange-K) download is over 500Mb/s.If I try to make a bandwidth test via 192.168.111.1 (see rule n0.4 in route table) I can see 500Mb/s = 2nd optic link is 100% fine.RB3001 proc usage is in 5%, 95% of RAM are free, I can`t fix this issue because similar setup I have in another sites and always worked properly.Internet from gw via the both sites are working, internet from client via 2nd gw is too slow. Is there som problem with marking, routing or somethink like this?Btw tracert from client seems be ok too.Tracing route to dsl.sk [217.67.19.197]over a maximum of 30 hops:1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.100.12    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.111.1

If you dont know where the problem is then dont only provide snippets/export file=anynameyouwish ( minus router serial number, any public WANIP information, keys tec.One common issue is not to disable fastttrack when mangling affects most of the traffic.

It looks like you did not disable the fasttrack rule (the dummy rules are listed in your printout), or at least omit it for the connections that are supposed to use the Orange-K routing table. Fasttrack is not compatible with connections that have been routing-marked. You should either disable the fasttrack rule, or add condition to it like routing-mark=main, or abandon the mangle solution and use routing rules instead.Please note that your RB3011 is not capable of routing > 500Mbps without fasttrack active and usable.

My main suspect is fastrack too, but there is no option to disable fastrack via Winbox.Couldn`t remove manlge rules <> cannot remove builtin.[admin@GW] > ip firewall mangle remove numbers=0failure: cannot remove builtinI have to figure out how to disable these builtin rules.Edit: I`m not able to remove these rules, so any suggestions?Upgrade to v7 may can help?Buy a new gw, e,g, 5009?

My main suspect is fastrack too, but there is no option to disable fastrack via Winbox.It's a firewall filter rule withaction=fasttrack-connection... disable it (or remove it). Just beware, existing connections, which are already fasttracked, will remain fasttracked even if said rule is disabled or removed. If you want to test the solution quickly, it's safest to reboot router after disabling the said rule.Running ROS v7 will almost certainly (slightly) reduce router performance due to changes in routing part of linux kernel. Purchasing newer and faster touter is certainly a good way forward. Specially as mangling is (still) incompatible with fasttracking.

If you continue to struggle, perhaps an online teamviewer/anydesk session to show you how.......... shouldnt need to though........

Reality check:https://mikrotik.com/product/RB3011UiAS ... estresultsRouting	25 Filter rules	107.6	1306.7	110.5452.6I think it is simply time to get a faster router, capable of managing 1 Gb internet, even if you get your 3011 work as best as it can, it won't probably go over 500 Mb.And yes that would probably be a RB5009.

Ok it seems I already fixed it.There was need disable fasttrack in filter rules, not in mangle section.I measured 350/350 via old server (proc cel G1610T at 100%), so I think there will better numbers with modern machines. RB3011 at 20-30% during the speedtest.Thanks for your time guys.Solved.
