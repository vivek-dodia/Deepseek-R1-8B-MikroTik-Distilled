+1I really need this feature.I own hAP lite RB9412nd-tc and I tested with firmware 7.16.2 and it returns "unsupported option '<tls-crypt>'"My old ASUS AC51 can connect using the same OpenVPN config but MikroTik can't!

Is there any update on this? 7.16 still seems to have issues importing opvn files that have the tls-auth certificate in them.
