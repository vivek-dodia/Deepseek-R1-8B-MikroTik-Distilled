Hi all, as the title implies, when setting up a cap on CAPsMAN, I get an error message "no connection to CAPsMAN" I'm not sure if there is a firewall rule that might be blocking the traffic? I can ping the CapsMan router from the cap and visa versa. I'm at my ends here.The Caps are directly connected to the router, from ether3-ether6Any help would be greatly appreciated.Router ConfigCaps Config

> Note: CAPsMAN uses UDP port 5246 for manager traffic and UDP port 5247 for data traffic

Your firewall is quite strict at dropping anything not allowed. Which is good. But you have to allow capsman protocol. From a note in documentation for capsman v2 (the old wireless capsman):I didn't find similar information for the new capsman (wifi version), it could use different protocol and/or ports ... probably it doesn't use port 5247 since the new capsman doesn't support capsman forwarding.

Sure this has to be disabled?

Originally, I thought that this rule needs to be disabled as the Router itself, doesn't have WiFi capabilities and doesn't possess WiFi interfaces. Unless I misunderstood that xD

If CAP and CAPsMAN are different devices, then they won't communicate using address of 127.0.0.1 (neither of them) ... hence this rule doesn't apply.Or is it? If CAPsMAN communicates with itself (another process perhaps), then it might use 127.0.0.1 ... @JPbarries, try to enable the rule and see if that makes any difference. My bet would still be the UDP port 5246, mentioned in my previous post, but can't find the rule which would either allow it or drop it (there's one which allows everything through bridge-IN and with corresponding src-address, so that one should allow it).

Doesn't seem as if any traffic is hitting that rule. If you could perhaps guide me on how to create the rule that uses the specified ports in your previous post please.I'm guessing it's an input rule with protocol upd and src. port to be 5246,5247

You are absolutely right, @mkx!Checked everything (I could), I doubt if this rule is correct:Can you, at least as a test, remove the in-interface?

@erlinden.Thanks for your responseI've disabled that rule, not quite sure what the purpose of this rule was. I was instructed from one of my other posts to have that rule created. However, the Cap still states " no connection to CAPsMAN" after I disabled the admin access rule.


---
### Author: Wed Sep 25, 2024 3:58 pm

By disabling the accept rule is disabled (and it is no longer accepting traffic). Instead, enable it and remove the in-interface. Again...just for testing. You can enable logging to see which traffic is passing that rule.

@erlindenI've removed the in-inteface, but the Cap still states "no connection to CAPsMAN" I even reset the CAP again to make sure :/

Aaah...sorry it took me this longYou have the wireless package installed and are configuring the old CAPsMAN:Remove the wireless package, it's useless.Then, follow the guide:

@erlindenI thought that it might have been something in line with this. As our previous router (hAP ac2) -whch did work with the existing CAPS, even after I've upgraded the RouterOS 6 to 7 - was replaced with the RB5009UG+S+. and now that I want to configure CAPsMAN again, I started running into these issues. I've set for uninstall. Just need to wait for everyone to leave the office before I can restart the routerBut thanks to you and mkx for your continued support. I will attend to this and revert back

As a side note:whenever you change something in firewall rules, clear connections table or restart.Or it might take a while before you see the effect.But wireless/wifi-qcom confusion is going to be the winner here.As of ROS7.13, you don't even need to load wifi-qcom driver anymore for capsman controller.Those hooks are there by default in base ROS package.

The reboot is not necessary for implementing CAPsMAN, it's just for clean up purposes.Do you still have the config of the hAP ac2? Then it would be sufficient to just import the /interface wifi part of that device (ewxcepot for any local config).

I do, however the RouterOS is still that of 6.49.17.I also did change the config as you suggested, however, the CAP is still not able to see the capsman. Still getting no Connection to CapsMan, unless I did something wrong#create a security profile#create configuraiton profiles to use for provisioning#configure provisioning rules, configure band matching as needed#enable CAPsMAN serviceEDIT: LOL, As I went through the steps again, as I didn't use the command in the terminal to do the setup, but rather used the User Interface (UI) I found that the CAPsMAN was enabled on the router as there was a tick box, but as I typed in the above code to get the response and to paste the results here, I saw that the CAPsMAN was disabled, but in the UI the tick box was marked. And then as soon as I ran the code to enable the CAPsMAN on the router, BOOM!! The CAP was able to identify the CAPsMAN!!! Thank you erlinden!!!

So, if I get this right, the CAPSMAN appeared enabled in Winbox/Webfig while it was actually disabled in the actual (CLI/terminal) configuration?It seems like a bug that can deceive/trick lots of people.

That is correctOne of the reasons I started to pull my hair out of my head. But as I went through the terminal to retrieve the code to paste in my reply, I noticed that the terminal stated that the CAPsMAN was disabled. yet the UI said it was enabled. After enabling it in the terminal the CAP immediately started to register with the CAPsMAN.
