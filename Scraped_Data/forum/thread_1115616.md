I have the following config working as expected, except that after power outage CAPSMAN is really slow to establish the connection to the CAPs after the power comes back up.At the moment CAPSMAN connects and disconnects to the CAPs many times before it successfully establishes connection and provision the configuration.Does it matter that hap AX3 is version 7.16 and the 2 wap ax are 7.15?Any suggestions on how to speed up the process?

Are you referring to caps radios becoming visible in capsman or the radios themselves becoming visible to clients ?The former should be rather quick. On my installations it is a matter of seconds after reboot.The latter can take up to 15 minutes if you use DFS frequencies (radar checks needs to be completed first before the AP is allowed to transmit).Only on 5GHz radios or also 2GHz radios ?Which device is acting as controller ?Is the problem with all APs or only some ?

Are you referring to caps radios becoming visible in capsman or the radios themselves becoming visible to clients ?The radios pop up in CAPSMAN for few seconds and then disappear, the can't become visible to the clients at all.Only on 5GHz radios or also 2GHz radios ?Both 5 and 2GHz radios.Which device is acting as controller ?Is the problem with all APs or only some ?hap AX3 is the main controller, the problem is only with the 2 wap ax APs, the hap ax2 is being managed by CAPsMAN but also gets the management super slow.From the time I posed this topic till now only ax2 has managed to get settings from AX3, the other two are still tryingI tried Skip DFS Channels all and disabled, no change

Then it may be time to put your config on the table.Controller and 1 wap AX please.Make sure to remove all private/public info.And please post both configs between code quotes.

Here is my config, please let me know if you see anything wrong with it, but as I previously stated it was working few days ago when I installed the wap ax access points. Nothing has changed except the fact that I had power outage and then it was not workinghap ax3 - CAPsMAN - managerCode:Select all# 2024-12-06 09:42:03 by RouterOS 7.16.1

I've noticed that after 3 days of trying everything was working again as expected, but again today we had power outage for 5 minutes and now again it is struggling to get the radios back up.I think this might be a clue why its not working, the cap-wifi1 and cap-wifi2 are getting provisioning fast and are identical to the management CAP. These 2 are on hap ax 2.The cap-wifi3 and cap-wifi4 in red are on wap ax and from what i see in Radios tab for 5GHz band it is trying to get few more bands assigned. Do I need to set some additional parameters in Configuration or similar to get the same result as on hap ax2?

Code:Select all/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wifi1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=wifi2Your wifi interfaces should not be manually added to the bridge.Only have ether1 and ether2 as part of the bridge:Code:Select all/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2

This solved the issue with CAPsMAN provisioning, but now DHCP server don't give IP addresses to devices connected to WiFi trough the CAP devices.External radios or local radios ?What's this ?Code:Select all/ip dhcp-server network
add address=0.0.0.0/24 gateway=0.0.0.0 netmask=24I think that shouldn't be there.Your firewall rules seem odd, certainly not default but I don't see a direct reason there why it shouldn't work.Is anything visible in log file about DHCP messages ?

External radios or local radios ?if by external you mean the radios of the wap ax devices that are managed by the hap ax3 CAPsMAN, yes I can't get IP when I am trying to connect trough an external radioI can connect to wifi and get IP when I connect to the radio on my main router hap ax3. But not trough the radios of the CAP devices.add address=0.0.0.0/24 gateway=0.0.0.0 netmask=24Its an artefact left from config, removed it - not solved the issue

I was able to resolve the issue by setting the Bridge - Admin MAC address and after that adding the cap WiFi interfaces to their bridges.It seems the problem was that after reboot some times the CAP bridges get different MAC addresses assigned.
