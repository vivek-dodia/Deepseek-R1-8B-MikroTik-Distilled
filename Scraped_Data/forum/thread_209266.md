```
{
    :local Result [/tool fetch url=https://ipconfig.io/json as-value output=user];

    :if ( $Result->"status" = "finished" ) do={
        :local Data [:deserialize from=json value=($Result->"data")];
        
        :log info ("Your IP address is " . $Data->"ip");
        :log info ("You are located in " . $Data->"country" . " (" . $Data->"country_iso" . ")");
    };
}
```
