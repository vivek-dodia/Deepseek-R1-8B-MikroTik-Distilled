Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive guide for configuring IP Routing on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 (or 6.48 and 7.x) device for a point-to-point link using a specific subnet and bridge interface. This documentation will cover all the aspects you've requested, including core concepts, security, and practical examples.

## 1. Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** We're setting up a point-to-point link, such as between two buildings or offices. We'll use a MikroTik router on each end to establish IP connectivity and allow devices on either side of the bridge to communicate with each other. The key requirement is to route traffic using a dedicated subnet across this link.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (or 6.48, 7.x)
*   **Configuration Level:** Advanced
*   **Network Scale:** Point-to-Point Link
*   **Subnet:** 48.107.119.0/24
*   **Interface Name:** `bridge-46` (This is our dedicated bridge interface)

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step implementation using both the CLI and Winbox, with detailed explanations.

### 2.1. CLI Implementation

**Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface (if it doesn't exist)**

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-46
```

*   **Explanation:** This creates a new bridge interface named `bridge-46`. Bridge interfaces allow multiple physical or virtual interfaces to act as a single network segment, in this case, to facilitate the point-to-point link.

**Step 2: Add Interfaces to the Bridge**
    * This step will vary based on what interface is used to make the point to point link. It could be a physical ethernet or wireless interface.
    * For this example we will use eth2
```mikrotik
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-46 interface=eth2
```

**Step 3: Assign an IP Address to the Bridge Interface**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=48.107.119.1/24 interface=bridge-46
```

*   **Explanation:** This command assigns the IP address `48.107.119.1` with a `/24` subnet mask to the bridge interface `bridge-46`. This address will serve as the gateway for other devices on this network. On the other end of the point-to-point link a different address in this subnet will need to be used. For example 48.107.119.2/24

**Step 4: Ensure IP Forwarding is Enabled**
   * Most often IP forwarding is enabled by default but in some instances it can be disabled, to be sure we will verify it and enable it if it is not.
```mikrotik
/ip settings
set forwarding=yes
```

*   **Explanation:** This command ensures that the router allows traffic to be forwarded between interfaces.

**Step 5: (Optional) Add an IP Route (If needed for accessing this subnet from a different network.)**
    * This step is not always necessary and depends on the requirements of the router. For a point to point link, it may not be needed. If a router does not know how to reach this subnet, a route will need to be added.
    * We will assume that the gateway to this router is 192.168.88.1
```mikrotik
/ip route
add dst-address=48.107.119.0/24 gateway=192.168.88.1
```

### 2.2. Winbox Implementation

1.  **Connect to your Router:** Open Winbox and connect to your MikroTik router.
2.  **Create the Bridge Interface:** Go to `Interfaces` -> `Bridge` tab. Click the `+` button, enter `bridge-46` in the "Name" field, and click `Apply` then `OK`.
3.  **Add interfaces to the Bridge Interface:** Go to `Interfaces` -> `Bridge` -> `Ports` tab. Click the `+` button, select `bridge-46` from the "Bridge" drop-down and the interface (e.g., `eth2`) from the "Interface" drop-down, and click `Apply` then `OK`.
4.  **Assign IP Address:** Go to `IP` -> `Addresses`. Click the `+` button. In the `Address` field, enter `48.107.119.1/24`. In the `Interface` drop-down, select `bridge-46`. Click `Apply` then `OK`.
5. **Ensure IP Forwarding is enabled:** Go to `IP` -> `Settings`. Check the box next to "Forwarding" and click `Apply` then `OK`.
6. **(Optional) Add an IP Route:** Go to `IP` -> `Routes`. Click the `+` button. In the "Dst. Address" field, enter `48.107.119.0/24`. In the "Gateway" field, enter `192.168.88.1` (or the correct gateway). Click `Apply` then `OK`.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

Here are the complete commands from the above steps in a single block:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-46

/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-46 interface=eth2

/ip address
add address=48.107.119.1/24 interface=bridge-46

/ip settings
set forwarding=yes

/ip route
add dst-address=48.107.119.0/24 gateway=192.168.88.1
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

### Common Pitfalls:

*   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** Using a wrong subnet mask (e.g., /16 instead of /24) can cause IP address conflicts and routing issues.
*   **Interface Not Assigned to Bridge:** Forgetting to add the physical interfaces to the bridge will mean traffic cannot pass through the bridge.
*   **IP Forwarding Disabled:** If forwarding is not enabled, the router won't route traffic between interfaces.
*   **Firewall Blocking Traffic:** If a firewall rule is configured to block traffic on this bridge it will prevent the connection from working.
*   **Incorrect Gateway:** If a route needs to be added and the gateway is incorrect, this will lead to routing issues.
*   **MTU issues**: Mismatch of MTU between interfaces can cause connection issues. This will likely only cause an issue if a virtual tunnel is used such as a vlan or vpn.

### Troubleshooting:

1.  **Ping:** Use `ping 48.107.119.2` (or the IP address on the other end of your link) to verify basic connectivity.
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 48.107.119.2
    ```

    *   **Error Scenario:** If you receive "Host unreachable" or timeout errors, check IP addresses, bridge configuration, interfaces, and basic connectivity.

2.  **Traceroute:** Use `traceroute 48.107.119.2` to trace the path traffic is taking.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 48.107.119.2
    ```

    *   **Error Scenario:** If the trace stops at the first hop (your router), you might have routing problems or firewall blocking it.
3.  **Torch:** Use `torch interface=bridge-46` to see real-time traffic.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=bridge-46
    ```

    *   **Error Scenario:** If you don't see any traffic, check interface configuration, cable connections, or firewall.
4.  **Log:** Check system logs under `/system log` for any errors related to interfaces, IP addresses, or routing.
    ```mikrotik
    /system log print
    ```

    *   **Error Scenario:** Look for messages like "interface down", "address conflict", or "no route to host."
5. **Interface status:** In `Interface` window in Winbox, it is possible to see if an interface is enabled or not, the current status and if it is running. A red 'X' would indicate that the interface is not enabled.
6. **Interface Counters:** The `Interface` window in Winbox also displays traffic data. Using this it can be verified if packets are being sent and recieved on the link. This can help diagnose if there is a physical issue with the connection.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Ping Test:** Ping the IP address of the device on the other end of the point-to-point link from the Mikrotik, and from any device on the local network attached to the bridge interface to verify network reachability.
2.  **Interface traffic:** Verify the interface counters in Winbox to see if data is moving across the interface.
3.  **Traceroute Test:** Use traceroute to confirm that the packets are going through the configured path and not bypassing the network.
4.  **Firewall Rule Verification:** Verify that a firewall rule is not blocking the traffic.
5.  **Connectivity Tests:** If connected to a larger network, test access to other network resources to ensure proper routing.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik's bridge functionality is powerful but has limitations like spanning-tree issues if not properly configured.
*   **Routing Protocols:** For more complex routing scenarios, MikroTik supports protocols like OSPF, BGP, and RIP.
*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** VRF allows multiple routing tables on the same device. This could be useful if multiple independent networks are connected to the router.
*   **Policy-Based Routing (PBR):** PBR allows for more advanced routing decisions based on packet properties.

### Example using less common features:

* **MACVLAN** : MACVLAN allows multiple MAC addresses on a single interface. This is useful for hosting virtual machines on a single physical interface.
* **VLAN**: VLAN tags can be assigned to the bridge interface and allow more logical network segregation.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

MikroTik API examples using MikroTik specific calls.
These examples assume that the API is enabled on the router and that you have authentication details. For demonstration, basic HTTP authentication is used. In production systems, use more secure authentication methods. The IP of the router used is 192.168.88.1

**Note:** MikroTik REST API calls require an API user to be created in the Mikrotik and that the API service is enabled. This will vary based on the network setup of the router and are not covered in this documentation.

## 8. In-Depth Explanation of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** In MikroTik, a bridge is like a virtual switch. It allows multiple interfaces to act as a single Layer 2 network. All interfaces connected to a bridge are in the same broadcast domain. It does not inherently perform IP routing.
*   **Routing:** Routing is the process of determining the best path for a packet to travel from one network to another. MikroTik uses its routing table, which consists of static routes set by the user as well as dynamic routes learned from routing protocols, to make these decisions.
*   **Firewall:** MikroTik's firewall operates on Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model. It examines traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols and other criteria. Firewall rules are applied to a traffic flow on a per interface basis.
*   **IP Addressing:** MikroTik supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. Each interface has an assigned IP address and subnet. The subnet mask determines the network size and number of valid hosts.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for the router's user accounts.
*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the router's management interfaces using source IP filtering in the firewall.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable unused services like the API or telnet.
*   **Update RouterOS:** Keep the RouterOS software updated to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement a strict firewall policy, allowing only necessary traffic.
*   **Secure API Access:** For API access, use HTTPS and secure authentication. Consider using certificate-based authentication.
*   **RoMON** RoMON allows layer 2 management of routers. This should be disabled if not needed because it is a security concern as it allows access without logging in.
