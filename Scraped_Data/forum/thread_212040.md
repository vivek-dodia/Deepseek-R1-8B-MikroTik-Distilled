hello,i have RouterOS x86 running in a virtual machine (bhyve on FreeBSD 15.0).  the virtual machine has four Ethernet PCI network devices:Code:Select allhowever, while the "Virtio" devices are detected correctly, the Chelsio VF is not:Code:Select alli assume this is because the kernel is missing a driver for this card.  is there some kind of HCL for RouterOS x86 that lists supported drivers?  or is it worth asking MikroTik support to add the appropriate driver?unfortunately i can't use CHR as it doesn't support bhyve (because MikroTik apparently wrongly believe it's paravirtualisation).

thanks jaclaz, this works a lot better than the x86 image (if only for improved licensing :-)unfortunately though, it still does not seem to include the driver for the T540 VF:Code:Select alli didn't see anything in all_packages that seems relevant either.

Yep, it’s also up to the host OS drivers to enable SR-IOV support.correct.  host OS has SR-IOV enabled, this is working in all virtual machines on this host except for RouterOS VM.The virtual machine can check if SR-IOV is available, but if you try to turn it on without driver support, you’ll just get an error or warning.right.  please read my original post, which is about whether RouterOS x86 / CHR has driver for Chelsio T540-CR VF device.  i do not get error or warning, but device does not appear in /interface/print.this is nothing to do with FreeBSD - question is whether RouterOS has driver for this device.

It’s all about the virtual machine support at the host OS level, not the guest OS.RouterOS x86 and CHR are completely different. RouterOS x86 is for bare-metal installations, while CHR is designed for virtual machines that require proper support for virtual drivers. If the virtual drivers in the virtual host and its host OS aren’t set up correctly, you won’t be able to use them in CHR.

let me provide an example from a non-RouterOS Linux system, which is a VM with a T540 VF PCI passthrough device.we can see the device in lspci:Code:Select all'00:07.0 Ethernet controller: Chelsio Communications Inc T540-CR Unified Wire Ethernet Controller [VF]' - this is our Virtual Function device, exposed from the host via PCI passthrough.and you can see lspci says "Kernel driver in use: cxgb4vf" - meaning the Linux kernel in the VM has attached the "cxgb4vf" driver to this device.and in "dmesg" we can see the Linux kernel has detected this as a network device:Code:Select alland indeed this network device shows up in Linux:Code:Select allthe problem i'm reporting in this thread is that, apparently, the RouterOS kernel is missing "cxgb4vf" driver, so it cannot detect the PCI device as a network interface.

today MikroTik support sent me a development release (7.17_ab236) which adds support for the T540 VF!  so hopefully this will be in 7.17.0.i did notice a strange bug where the router can see itself in /ip/neighbor/print:Code:Select allbut i think (based on a recent converstaion with Chelsio support) that this is a hardware bug in the NIC's switch chip, not a RouterOS bug.  we'll see how it actually works when i get around to testing it properly.
