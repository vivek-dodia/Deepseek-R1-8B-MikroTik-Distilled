No web\winbox\ssh at all on vlan interface, but everything works on ether1. Sniffer can see incoming packets.Looks like I'm too close to see clearly. What should I check?

## Response 1
You should check if you added your VLAN to the correct interface list.Also this is not simple AP setup, looks like you are trying to use your wAP ax as a router not simple AP.What do you actually want from your setup ? Do you want simple AP or do you want to use it as a wireless router ? ---

## Response 2
You currently have your ap configured as router, what would you like it to be and how would you like it to work?If you want to know more about VLAN, have a look at this great topic:viewtopic.php?t=143620 ---

## Response 3
It's okay. It give internet to completely isolated office branch, that use only wifi, so putting one AP as router looked better idea than making separate vlan for it. Also I got some problems configuring AX capsman, because capsman filtering was removed from ax, so I made it standalone.Now on ether1 it has main office network as WAN and management vlan. So I need it to have internet from office network, and manage it through vlan.I put ether1 in MGMT interface list just to finish configuring, because if I remove it, I lose access to AP through office network, and has no access through vlan. Users in LAN woud have no access to AP management copletely, and access will be removed by firewall after end of configuring.I know the meaning of term "vlan", thanx. ---

## Response 4
Simplify, have main router provide all vlans and rules etc.Use wapAX simply as a switch AP, the objective of giving one branch of office isolated access to internet is accomplished.This simply means a vlan only for them and the MT device gets an IP address from the trusted vLAN.ONE BRIDGE, rest vlans, done!Use one port as on off bridge port for configuration purposes safe, and easy place to recover from any issues later as well.Will assume trusted subnet is vlan999 with lanip 192.168.99.0/24Will assume isolated office subnet is vlan88 with lanip 192.168.88.0/24Step One: add ether2 settings below, and then continue config changes from ether2 ( plug in laptop with IPV4 settings 192.168.55.2 and your in )Clean, simple easy, works!!..... ( and best of all NO phucking capsman )

## Response 5
Still could help to have a look at that topic.What IP address do you have on the client when managing this routerboard? Is it in the same network segment as where the routers mgt IP is in? ---

## Response 6
Still could help to have a look at that topic.Amen to that brother, a vlan is a vlan except when using RoS and then mysteriously people get confused. ---

## Response 7
Also I got some problems configuring AX capsman, because capsman filtering was removed from ax, so I made it standalone.Do you have multiple Mikrotik APs ? If you don't then there is no need for CAPsMAN. ---

## Response 8
Do you have multiple Mikrotik APs ?I have a dozen of mipsbe-wapac, capac, capacxl etc. And capsman to rule em all.What IP address do you have on the client when managing this routerboard? Is it in the same network segment as where the routers mgt IP is in?ether1: 192.168.1.X/24 (dhcp)ether1-vlan: 10.0.0.X/24 (dhcp)bridge (ether2+wlan1+wlan2): 192.168.88.1/24It must be managed only through 10.0.0.0/24 from PCs in different networks alowed by main router firewall rules. No access from other networks. Now it is temporarily managed from PC in 192.168.1.0/24. I have a bunch of SwOs devices similarly managed without any problems. ---
