I think I'm seeing a similar issue.Code:Select all/ip cloud printshows the IP being updated, but actual DNS resolution against *.mynetname.net seems to getting a "Server failed" response.

Since DDNS going down is an ongoing issue, I wish Mikrotik would provide a website that informs people about what's happening. The website could possibly include an ETA.

We depend on this service for critical operations, so having a reliable alternative or knowing when it will be restored would be greatly appreciated.Universal solution would be for Mikrotik to implement DNS RFC2136 support allowing dynamic record updates to *any* standards compliant DNS server/service.Now they have their own custom dynamic DNS protocol and kissthenet.net servers.World is full of custom, free and commercial dynamic DNS services and protocols, but RFC2136 should be first to be implemented.

Is there any alternative solution we can use to ensure a stable connection? We depend on this service for critical operations, so having a reliable alternative or knowing when it will be restored would be greatly appreciated.Pro tip: Don’t use these services for business-critical operations. We’ve switched to another provider since there have been plenty of issues in the past.

I've found following script that updates your DDNS in no-ip service. You can add it as script and set to run in scheduler under system setting.Code:Select all# No-IP DDNS Updater
# http://www.noip.com/integrate/

:global publicIP;
:global abortUpdate;

:if ([:typeof $abortUpdate] != "bool") do={
	:set $abortUpdate false;
}

:if ($abortUpdate) do={
	:error "DDNS: Update aborted. Intervention required.";
}

:local currentIP;
:local targetInterface "ether1";

:local ddnsUser "yourusername";
:local ddnsPass "yourpassword";

Current issue aside I just wish that they would start using more respectable domains names for this dynamic DNS service.kissthenet.net and mynetname.net sound more like highly suspicious chinese spam operation than reliable DNS service.Maybe something with their main brand domain like:ns1.dyn.mikrotik.comns2.dyn.mikrotik.comand CNAMEs as:<serial>.sn.mikrotik.com IN CNAME <ip>

Nameservers are usually rock stable. But I have no idea of the architecture of this cloud service tbh. It is what it is:a convenient feature for home users or personal use. My opinion: don't rely on it for critical access or in commercial environment. It is out of your control.

None of you can complain about anything, since the service is not paid,it is not included in the RuterOS license,it is just a freecourtesythat MikroTik does.Relying on it for work is crazy.

just use your own dns, set up a cname to the ugly domain name and problem solved.Is not.Even if your own DNS server can reply with CNAME record, clients still won't be able to resolve the serial.sn.mynetname.net ... the only way around it is to actually update A record on your DNS server whenever WAN IP address changes. Since you have full control over both entities (router with dynamic address and DNS server), it's possible to script some hack (which might work just fine).

FWIW I wrote a quickie script to update CloudFlare DNS directly last night.Code:Select all:local wanInterface "ether1"
 	#DNS Zone ID 
       :local zoneID “12345" 
       #DNS record ID
       :local recordID "12345"
       #your API token
       :local apiToken "12345"

# determine if we use the dhcp script or the current address
 :if ([:typeof $"lease-address"] = "nothing") \
	do={:local myIP [:pick [/ip address get [find where interface=$wanInterface] address] 0 [:find [/ip address get [find where interface=$wanInterface] address] "/"]]; \
		/tool fetch check-certificate=yes url="https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$zoneID/dns_records/$recordID" http-method=patch http-header-field="Content-Type:application/json,Authorization:Bearer $apiToken" http-data="{\"content\":\"$myIP\"}"; \
	} \
	else={/tool fetch check-certificate=yes url="https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$zoneID/dns_records/$recordID" http-method=patch http-header-field="Content-Type:application/json,Authorization:Bearer $apiToken" http-data="{\"content\":\"$"lease-address"\"}"; \
	}The idea is you save this to /system/scripts and then add the script name to the dhcp clientscriptproperty. It’ll then run automatically when the router gets a new lease. Or you can run it manually.

I do not agree about this:should not be used for business purposes.If you are aware of that nothing is guaranteed and you do not have problem with some outage, why not use it for business.Its a price/quality question.DynDNS was down for 10+ hour.  I can just use my cellphone as an router and connect to it and work.  ( I do now that its not possible for all to do that)

I do not agree about this:should not be used for business purposes.If you are aware of that nothing is guaranteed and you do not have problem with some outage, why not use it for business.Its a price/quality question.DynDNS was down for 10+ hour.  I can just use my cellphone as an router and connect to it and work.  ( I do now that its not possible for all to do that)Clearly you are not paying attention, many folks are using this service for business and were complaining, aka way more than your voice of one.To be truthful, dont care about such idiots, I want the regular joe soho and home users to be aware of the limitations of the free service and especially if they rely on BTH.

Update: If I do a traceroute using UDP instead of ICMP, I can reach cloud2.mikrotik.com over IPv6 from my place (but ping & traceroute with ICMPv6 don't work). Which means it's not a routing problem but a MikroTik server problem.

Thank you! I can confirm AAAA record is now working. Tested with two routers at two locations.
