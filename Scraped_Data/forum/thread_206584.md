the file is called .npk?why you use () ???No the file is named as a mikrotik firmware, something like "routeros-arm-6.49.10.npk".

I didn't even think about the use (), i'm kind new to scripting, thanks for the hint!If you know Linux/UNIX, the [] are similar to `` backtick to run a command and replace result in-place.Yes and the new way of doing this in UNIX/Linux, not using back tics chars. is like this.Use dollar sign and regular parentheses.Code:Select all

It's likely better thinking of the RouterOS CLI in terms of a REPL for a programming language, than ANY UNIX shell.It's thinking CLI is more like Linux/UNIX is where the trouble startsFWIW, I'm not sure $() is newer than ``.  The $() is more for variable assignment IMO, while backtick works anywhere.Yes and the new way of doing this in UNIX/Linux, not using back tics chars. is like this.Use dollar sign and regular parentheses.Code:Select all
