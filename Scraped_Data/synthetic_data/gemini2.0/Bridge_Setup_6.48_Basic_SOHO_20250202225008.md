**Bridge Setup in MikroTik RouterOS 6.48**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

* Create a bridge to connect multiple network segments while isolating traffic.
* Network Scale: SOHO

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Create a New Bridge:**
   - Navigate to Interfaces -> Bridge -> click "+"
   - Enter a name for the bridge (e.g., "br0")
   - Click "Apply"

2. **Add Interfaces to the Bridge:**
   - Select the interfaces you want to bridge (e.g., "eth1", "eth2")
   - Drag and drop them onto the bridge name in the Interfaces list
   - Click "Apply"

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/interface bridge add name=br0
/interface bridge port add bridge=br0 interface=eth1
/interface bridge port add bridge=br0 interface=eth2
/interface bridge apply br0
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

* Ensure that the interfaces you are bridging are in different network segments.
* Avoid creating loops in your network topology by connecting bridged interfaces back to the bridge.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

* Check the Interfaces list to verify that the interfaces are added to the bridge.
* Ping hosts on different segments connected to the bridge to test connectivity.

**Related Features and Considerations**

* **VLANs:** Bridges can be used to isolate VLANs within a physical network.
* **Port Isolation:** Enable port isolation on the bridge to prevent direct communication between devices connected to different ports.

**MikroTik REST API Examples**

**Create a Bridge:**

* Endpoint: `/api/interface/bridge`
* Method: POST
* JSON Payload:
```json
{
  "name": "br0"
}
```

**Add Interfaces to a Bridge:**

* Endpoint: `/api/interface/bridge/port`
* Method: POST
* JSON Payload:
```json
{
  "bridge": "br0",
  "interface": "eth1"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1
}
```
