## Bridge Setup in RouterOS 7.12 (Expert)

### Configuration Scenario and Requirements

- Establish a bridge interface to connect multiple physical ports into a single logical network segment.
- Configure static IP address and routing for the bridge interface.
- Apply firewall rules to secure the bridge network.
- Monitor and troubleshoot bridge performance and connectivity.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Create Bridge Interface**

```
/interface bridge add name=bridge1
```

**2. Add Ports to Bridge**

```
/interface ethernet set ether16 master=bridge1
/interface ethernet set ether17 master=bridge1
```

**3. Assign IP Address and Routing**

```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1
/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.1.254
```

**4. Apply Firewall Rules**

```
/ip firewall filter add chain=input action=accept src-address=bridge1
/ip firewall filter add chain=output action=accept dst-address=bridge1
```

### Complete Configuration Commands

```
/interface bridge add name=bridge1
/interface ethernet set ether16 master=bridge1
/interface ethernet set ether17 master=bridge1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1
/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.1.254
/ip firewall filter add chain=input action=accept src-address=bridge1
/ip firewall filter add chain=output action=accept dst-address=bridge1
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

- **Ports not in bridge master:** Ensure the ports are correctly assigned to the bridge using the `/interface ethernet set` command.
- **IP address conflict:** Verify that the IP address assigned to the bridge interface is not already in use on the network.
- **Firewall rules blocking traffic:** Check the firewall rules and ensure that necessary traffic is allowed.

### Verification and Testing Steps

- **Ping:** Verify connectivity to the bridge interface by pinging the IP address of the bridge.
- **Traceroute:** Perform a traceroute to an external destination to check routing correctness.
- **SNMP monitoring:** Use SNMP to monitor bridge performance and statistics.

### Related Features and Considerations

- **Bridge VLANs:** Create virtual LANs within the bridge to segregate traffic.
- **Bonding:** Combine multiple physical ports into a single, high-bandwidth link.
- **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):** Prevent network loops in bridged environments.

**Security Best Practices:**

- Use strong passwords for bridge interface configuration.
- Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the bridge network.
- Regularly check for security updates and apply patches promptly.
