Okay, let's dive deep into configuring a MikroTik RouterOS device for a Hotspot network with a focus on IP addressing, including many other relevant aspects as requested, and keeping in mind the target RouterOS version of 6.48 (though concepts apply similarly to v7.x). This document will be comprehensive and practical.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** We are setting up a Hotspot network for a small business using a MikroTik router. This network will provide internet access to guests and employees using a captive portal. We'll use VLAN tagging on the interface connected to our network infrastructure for segmentation and later add IPv6 support to the infrastructure. We will configure a variety of features that are requested and demonstrate real-world use cases for each.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 6.48 (or 7.x - when applicable, differences will be noted).
*   **Network Type:** Hotspot network.
*   **Interface:** `vlan-88` (VLAN tagged interface).
*   **IPv4 Subnet:** `100.249.207.0/24`
*   **IPv6 Configuration:** To be implemented, with /64 subnet.
*   **Hotspot Configuration:** Basic configuration with user profiles and RADIUS integration is requested.
*   **Other Topics:** Comprehensive explanation on IP Pools, Routing, IP Settings, MAC server, RoMON, WinBox, Certificates, PPP AAA, RADIUS, User Management, Bridging and Switching, VLANs, Firewall, QoS, IP Services, High Availability, Mobile Networking, MPLS, Network Management, Routing, System, VPN, Wired Connections, Wireless, IoT, Hardware, Diagnostics, and Extended Features

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

### 2.1.  Initial Setup (CLI)

*   **Step 1: Interface Naming and VLAN tagging**

    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add name=vlan-88 vlan-id=88 interface=ether1 disabled=no
    ```

    *   This command creates a VLAN interface named `vlan-88` with a VLAN ID of 88, using `ether1` as the physical interface. We assume ether1 is connected to a device that supports 802.1Q VLANs

*   **Step 2: IPv4 Address Assignment**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=100.249.207.1/24 interface=vlan-88 network=100.249.207.0
    ```

    *   This command assigns the IP address `100.249.207.1` with a subnet mask of `/24` to the `vlan-88` interface, defining the network as `100.249.207.0`.

*   **Step 3: Enable DHCP Server**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool ranges=100.249.207.10-100.249.207.254
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=vlan-88 lease-time=30m name=dhcp1
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=100.249.207.0/24 gateway=100.249.207.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```

    *  This creates an IP pool, defines the DHCP server, and configures the network with DNS servers and a gateway.

*  **Step 4: Add IPv6 Addressing**

  ```mikrotik
  /ipv6 address
  add address=2001:db8:100:249::1/64 interface=vlan-88 advertise=yes
  ```

    *   This command configures an IPv6 address and enables Router Advertisements, allowing clients to get IPv6 addresses automatically.

*   **Step 5: Basic Firewall Setup (Required for NAT)**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall nat
    add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE
    ```

    *   Replace `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` with the interface that connects to the internet (e.g., `ether2`). This enables internet access for devices on the `vlan-88` network.

*   **Step 6: Enable IP Forwarding**

  ```mikrotik
  /ip settings
  set ipv4-forwarding=yes
  ```

  * This is required for the router to act as a router between interfaces.

        *   Click `Apply`. Go to Network and add network address `100.249.207.0/24`, gateway `100.249.207.1` and dns-servers `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`.
5. **IPv6 address:**
    *   Go to `IPv6` -> `Addresses`.
    *   Click the "+" button.
        *  `Address`: `2001:db8:100:249::1/64`
        * `Interface`: `vlan-88`
        * Select the "Advertise" option.
        * Click `Apply` and then `OK`.
6.  **Firewall NAT:**
    *   Go to `IP` -> `Firewall` -> `NAT`.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   `Chain`: `srcnat`
    *   `Out. Interface`: `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` (replace as per Step 5 above).
    *   `Action`: `masquerade`.
    *   Click `Apply` and then `OK`.
7. **Enable IP Forwarding:**
    *   Go to `IP` -> `Settings`
    *  Set `IPv4 Forwarding` to `yes`

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

The CLI configuration commands are spread across the different steps in section 2.  Here is a consolidated list:

```mikrotik

/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE

/ip settings
set ipv4-forwarding=yes
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Pitfall 1: Incorrect Interface Selection:** Using the wrong interface for the VLAN or DHCP server.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Double-check the interface name using `/interface print` and confirm physical connections. Use `/interface ethernet monitor ether1` to verify link and packet counts.
*   **Pitfall 2: Misconfigured DHCP Server:** Incorrect network address or IP range.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip dhcp-server print` to verify the DHCP server configuration and `/ip pool print` for the IP pool ranges. Check logs for DHCP related errors `/log print where topics~"dhcp"`.
*   **Pitfall 3: Firewall Issues:** Blocking essential traffic or not masquerading traffic correctly.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Verify the NAT rule (`/ip firewall nat print`). Use `/ip firewall filter print` to ensure there are no blocking filters. `Torch` tool can be used to analyze packets passing through the interfaces.
* **Pitfall 4: IPv6 Configuration issues**
    *  **Troubleshooting:** Verify IPv6 addresses with `/ipv6 address print`. Make sure clients are actually sending DHCPv6 request or relying on Router Advertisements and not Static IP addresses.
*   **Pitfall 5: Incorrect MTU:** A common cause of connectivity problems and packet fragmentation.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use the command `/interface ethernet print detail` to verify the MTU of ethernet interfaces. It is best practice to use the same MTU on every interface. Usually 1500.
*   **Error Scenario:** If clients cannot obtain IP addresses, first ensure the router has the correct IP address (`/ip address print`) and the interface is not disabled (`/interface print`). Next, verify the DHCP server is enabled (`/ip dhcp-server print` and check the `enabled` field). Then check the DHCP leases `/ip dhcp-server lease print`. Finally check firewall rules that may be blocking DHCP traffic.

## 5. Verification and Testing

*   **Ping:** `ping 100.249.207.1` from a device on the network and `ping 8.8.8.8` to verify internet connectivity. Use `/tool ping 8.8.8.8 interface=vlan-88` from the router. Use `/tool ping 2001:db8:100:249::1` for IPv6 connectivity.
*   **Traceroute:** `traceroute 8.8.8.8` to verify routing paths. Use `/tool traceroute 8.8.8.8 interface=vlan-88` from the router for path verification.
*   **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=vlan-88` to analyze live traffic. Look for DHCP and DNS traffic. Use torch filters to only see DHCP traffic.
*   **Interface Stats:** `/interface print stats` to check packet counts. Check for errors and packet loss.
*   **DHCP Leases:** `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to see the IP leases provided.
*   **IPv6 Neighbors:** `/ipv6 neighbor print` to see IPv6 neighbors on local networks.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

MikroTik supports a REST API, although it needs to be enabled on the router and is typically disabled by default due to security concerns. We'll show a basic example here; you need to install the REST API package first.

**Enabling the API:**

1. Go to `System` -> `Packages`
2. Ensure `restapi` is installed. If not, download and install it.
3. Go to `IP` -> `Services` and enable the `www-ssl` service (port 443).
4. Go to `/ip api`, enable api and add an user who has a proper permission.
5. We will use HTTPS with a valid certificate. If you don't have a valid certificate you can generate a self-signed cert. Be aware that web browser will complain when using self-signed certs.
6. Make sure your PC can connect to your router on port 443

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** Combines multiple interfaces into a single broadcast domain. A bridge acts like a switch. Used when Layer 2 is needed instead of routing.
*   **Routing:** Forwarding packets between networks. Router uses the routing table to decide the next hop for packets.
*   **Firewall:** Used to control traffic based on policies. Uses filter rules to deny or allow traffic, NAT rules for IP address translation and mangle rules to modify packets.
*   **Why Specific Commands:** Each command is designed to configure a specific aspect of the network. The commands are tied to the underlying RouterOS architecture.

    *   `/interface vlan add` : Creates a virtual VLAN interface on a physical interface.
    *   `/ip address add`: Assigns an IP address to an interface.
    *   `/ip dhcp-server add`: Creates a DHCP server instance on a selected interface.
    *   `/ip firewall nat add`: Creates a rule for network address translation.
    * `/ipv6 address add`: Configures IPv6 address on an interface.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Always change the default `admin` user password.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any unused services like `telnet`, `ftp`.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules for all interfaces and specific applications.
*   **Secure API:** Enable and configure HTTPS and use strong passwords for API users.
*   **Keep Software Up to Date:** Regularly update RouterOS to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Limit Access to Winbox/SSH:**  Only allow access from known IP addresses.
*   **MAC Address Access Control:** Implement MAC address based access controls.
* **RouterOS Secure Setup:** Use the MikroTik secure setup guide available in their documentation.
*  **Use HTTPS when connecting to the router:** Use a secure HTTPS connection to connect to the router with Winbox and Webfig.
* **Use the minimal set of open ports:** When not needed disable unused ports like the SSH port and API port.
* **Disable unnecessary packages:** Disable unnecessary packages to minimize attack surface.
* **Enable logging and monitoring:** Enable logging and monitoring to track issues and provide useful security related data for incidents.
* **Use VPNs to access the router remotely:** If remote access is needed, use a VPN for secure connections.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for MikroTik Topics

Please refer to Section 6 for detailed explanations on specific MikroTik features and their limitations.  Here we add specific configuration examples using CLI, where appropriate:

**Examples**

*   **NTP Client:**

    ```mikrotik
    /system ntp client
    set enabled=yes mode=unicast primary-ntp=pool.ntp.org
    ```
    * This will set the router to get the correct time from a NTP server.

*   **System Identity:**

    ```mikrotik
    /system identity set name=my-router
    ```
    * This sets a name for the router.

*   **Log Configuration:**

  ```mikrotik
  /system logging action
  add name=disk target=disk disk-file-name=log.txt
  add name=memory target=memory memory-lines=1000
  /system logging
  add action=disk topics=firewall,dhcp,system,error,critical
  add action=memory topics=firewall,dhcp,system,error,critical
  ```
  * This will add logs to memory and to disk for future reference and debugging.

*   **DHCPv6 Server:**

  ```mikrotik
  /ipv6 dhcp-server
  add interface=vlan-88 name=dhcp6-server
  /ipv6 dhcp-server lease print
  ```
  * This will enable DHCPv6 on the vlan-88 interface

*   **Basic firewall filter (blocking some traffic):**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=drop dst-port=25,110,143 protocol=tcp comment="drop SMTP, POP3, IMAP"
```

* This creates a firewall filter rule to block traffic to specific tcp ports for security reasons.
*   **Bonding Configuration (Mode Balance-RR) :**

```mikrotik
/interface bonding
add mode=balance-rr name=bond1 slaves=ether2,ether3
/ip address
add address=192.168.2.1/24 interface=bond1 network=192.168.2.0
```
*   This will combine two interfaces into one for bandwidth and redundancy purposes.
*   **VRRP Configuration (Master and Backup):**
    On the master router:

```mikrotik
/interface vrrp
add interface=ether1 vrid=1 priority=200 name=vrrp1 address=192.168.3.10/24
```
   On the backup router:

```mikrotik
/interface vrrp
add interface=ether1 vrid=1 priority=100 name=vrrp1 address=192.168.3.10/24
```
  *  This will create a virtual IP to provide High availability using VRRP.
* **BGP Configuration (Basic):**

```mikrotik
/routing bgp instance
add as=65000 name=bgp1 router-id=10.10.10.1
/routing bgp peer
add instance=bgp1 name=peer1 remote-address=10.10.10.2 remote-as=65001
```

*   This will set a basic BGP instance and a neighbor to peer with.

*  **OpenVPN Server (Simple Configuration):**

```mikrotik
/interface ovpn-server server
add certificate=selfsigned-cert default-profile=default enabled=yes interface=ether1 port=1194 user-profile=default
/ppp profile
set default use-encryption=yes
/ppp secret
add name=testuser password=testpass profile=default service=ovpn
```
* This will configure a very basic OpenVPN server listening on port 1194.

*  **WireGuard Configuration (Simple):**

```mikrotik
/interface wireguard
add listen-port=13231 mtu=1420 name=wg1 private-key="xxxxxxx"
/interface wireguard peers
add allowed-address=10.1.0.2/32 endpoint-address=172.17.1.2 endpoint-port=51820 interface=wg1 public-key="yyyyyyyy"
/ip address
add address=10.1.0.1/24 interface=wg1 network=10.1.0.0
```
*   This will configure a very basic WireGuard interface and a peer connection. The private key should be generated using `wg genkey`, and `wg pubkey` to obtain the public key. The public key of the remote client is needed.

**Tradeoffs Between Different Settings**

*   **Bridging vs. Routing:** Bridging is easier to set up for a small network but does not offer routing functionality.  Routing is required when you need to manage different networks.
*   **Firewall Complexity:** More complex firewall rules offer better security but can be harder to manage and troubleshoot.
*   **QoS Complexity:** More granular QoS can improve network performance for some users, but a complex QoS configuration can be difficult to implement.
