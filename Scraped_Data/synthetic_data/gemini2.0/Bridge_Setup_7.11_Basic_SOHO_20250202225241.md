**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

In this guide, we will walk through the steps on how to set up a bridge on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 device. A bridge is used to connect multiple network segments and allow devices on these segments to communicate with each other as if they were on the same network.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Create the bridge interface.**
```
/interface bridge add name=my-bridge
```

2. **Add ports to the bridge.**
```
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether2
```

3. **Set the bridge's IP address.**
```
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=my-bridge
```

4. **Enable DHCP server on the bridge.**
```
/ip dhcp-server add interface=my-bridge address-pool=my-pool range=192.168.1.10-192.168.1.254 lease-time=24h
```

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/interface bridge add name=my-bridge
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether2
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=my-bridge
/ip dhcp-server add interface=my-bridge address-pool=my-pool range=192.168.1.10-192.168.1.254 lease-time=24h
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

* **Incorrect port assignment:** Ensure that the ports assigned to the bridge are correct. If a port is not assigned, devices connected to that port will not be able to communicate with other devices on the bridge.
* **IP address conflict:** The IP address assigned to the bridge should not conflict with any other IP address on the network. If there is an IP address conflict, devices on the bridge will not be able to communicate with other devices on the network.
* **DHCP server misconfiguration:** The DHCP server should be configured correctly to provide IP addresses to devices on the bridge. If the DHCP server is not configured correctly, devices on the bridge will not be able to obtain IP addresses and will not be able to communicate with other devices on the network.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

* **Check the bridge interface.**
```
/interface bridge print
```

* **Check the bridge ports.**
```
/interface bridge port print
```

* **Check the IP address of the bridge.**
```
/ip address print
```

* **Test connectivity between devices on the bridge.**
Ping devices on different ports of the bridge to verify that they can communicate with each other.

**Related Features and Considerations**

* **VLANs:** VLANs can be used to segment traffic on the bridge.
* **Security:** Security features such as firewall rules and access lists can be used to protect the bridge from unauthorized access.

**MikroTik REST API Example**

**Endpoint:** `/interface/bridge`

**Request Method:** GET

**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "detail": "brief"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
[
  {
    ".id": "1",
    "name": "bridge1",
    "mtu": 1500,
    "admin-mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
    "disabled": false,
    "comment": ""
  }
]
```
