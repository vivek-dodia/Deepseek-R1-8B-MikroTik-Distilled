# MikroTik RouterOS: IP Pools in an Enterprise Environment

This document provides a deep dive into IP Pools within a MikroTik RouterOS environment targeting enterprise scenarios. It covers IP addressing, routing, related services, security, troubleshooting, and more, all with a focus on MikroTik specifics.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** An enterprise network has multiple departments requiring isolated subnets. Each department has varying numbers of devices, and the network admin needs dynamic IP allocation for each subnet. Static assignments are also required for some infrastructure components. The main goal is to achieve network isolation while providing a flexible IP allocation system. Additionally, high availability and redundancy is a requirement.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   Dynamic IP allocation for multiple subnets via DHCP server.
*   Static IP assignments for specific servers and networking equipment.
*   Separate IP pools for each department/subnet.
*   DHCP server configuration with lease management and option settings.
*   High availability configuration with VRRP for failover.
*   Secure access to management interfaces and services.
*   Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.
*   Use of VLAN tagging for network segmentation.
*   Integration with RADIUS for user authentication.
*   Implementation of firewall rules for each department.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)

### Step 1: Network Design and Planning

Before we start, let's define some example subnets and IP ranges. We'll use VLANs to segment the network:

| Department/VLAN  | VLAN ID | Subnet           | IP Pool Range          | Gateway         |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| IT Department    | 10      | 192.168.10.0/24  | 192.168.10.10-192.168.10.250 | 192.168.10.1   |
| Sales Department  | 20      | 192.168.20.0/24  | 192.168.20.10-192.168.20.250 | 192.168.20.1   |
| Guest Network     | 30      | 192.168.30.0/24  | 192.168.30.10-192.168.30.250 | 192.168.30.1   |
| Infrastructure    | 40      | 10.0.40.0/24  | 10.0.40.10-10.0.40.200 | 10.0.40.1   |


### Step 2: VLAN Configuration

**Using CLI:**
```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-it vlan-id=10 interface=ether1
add name=vlan-sales vlan-id=20 interface=ether1
add name=vlan-guest vlan-id=30 interface=ether1
add name=vlan-infra vlan-id=40 interface=ether1
```
**Using Winbox:** Go to *Interfaces* > *VLAN* tab > Click "+" to add VLAN interfaces.

### Step 3: IP Addressing and IP Pools

**Using CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=vlan-it network=192.168.10.0
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=vlan-sales network=192.168.20.0
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=vlan-guest network=192.168.30.0
add address=10.0.40.1/24 interface=vlan-infra network=10.0.40.0

/ip pool
add name=pool-it ranges=192.168.10.10-192.168.10.250
add name=pool-sales ranges=192.168.20.10-192.168.20.250
add name=pool-guest ranges=192.168.30.10-192.168.30.250
add name=pool-infra ranges=10.0.40.10-10.0.40.200
```

**Using Winbox:** Go to *IP* > *Addresses*, and *IP* > *Pools*. Add IP addresses to the interface and then define the corresponding pools.

### Step 4: DHCP Server Configuration

**Using CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add name=dhcp-it address-pool=pool-it interface=vlan-it authoritative=yes lease-time=1d
add name=dhcp-sales address-pool=pool-sales interface=vlan-sales authoritative=yes lease-time=1d
add name=dhcp-guest address-pool=pool-guest interface=vlan-guest authoritative=yes lease-time=1d
add name=dhcp-infra address-pool=pool-infra interface=vlan-infra authoritative=yes lease-time=1d

/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.10.0/24 gateway=192.168.10.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 dhcp-server=dhcp-it
add address=192.168.20.0/24 gateway=192.168.20.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 dhcp-server=dhcp-sales
add address=192.168.30.0/24 gateway=192.168.30.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 dhcp-server=dhcp-guest
add address=10.0.40.0/24 gateway=10.0.40.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 dhcp-server=dhcp-infra

/ip dhcp-server lease
```

**Using Winbox:** Go to *IP* > *DHCP Server* and *IP* > *DHCP Server Network*. Configure server and network for each VLAN.

### Step 5: Static IP Assignments (DHCP Leases)

**Using CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server lease
add address=192.168.10.100 mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 server=dhcp-it
add address=10.0.40.20  mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF server=dhcp-infra
```

**Using Winbox:** Go to *IP* > *DHCP Server* > *Leases*. Use "+" to create new leases.

### Step 6: IP Routing
**Using CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip route
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=YOUR_UPSTREAM_GATEWAY
```
Replace `YOUR_UPSTREAM_GATEWAY` with your actual gateway.

**Using Winbox:** Go to IP > Routes > add.

### Step 7: Firewall Configuration for VLANs
**Using CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=vlan-it out-interface=vlan-sales comment="Allow IT to Sales"
add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=vlan-sales out-interface=vlan-it comment="Allow Sales to IT"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=vlan-it out-interface=vlan-guest comment="Block IT to Guest"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=vlan-sales out-interface=vlan-guest comment="Block Sales to Guest"
add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=vlan-infra out-interface=vlan-it comment="Allow Infra to IT"
add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=vlan-infra out-interface=vlan-sales comment="Allow Infra to Sales"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=vlan-infra out-interface=vlan-guest comment="Block Infra to Guest"

add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established/Related"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=vlan-guest out-interface=ether1 comment="Block Guest to WAN"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=vlan-guest comment="Drop other Guest traffic"
```
**Using Winbox:** Go to *Firewall* > *Filter Rules* and configure accordingly.

### Step 8: High Availability with VRRP
**Using CLI (On both routers):**
```mikrotik
/interface vrrp
add name=vrrp-it interface=vlan-it vrid=1 priority=100 password=your_vrrp_password
add name=vrrp-sales interface=vlan-sales vrid=2 priority=100 password=your_vrrp_password
add name=vrrp-guest interface=vlan-guest vrid=3 priority=100 password=your_vrrp_password
add name=vrrp-infra interface=vlan-infra vrid=4 priority=100 password=your_vrrp_password

/ip address
add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=vrrp-it network=192.168.10.0
add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=vrrp-sales network=192.168.20.0
add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=vrrp-guest network=192.168.30.0
add address=10.0.40.1/24 interface=vrrp-infra network=10.0.40.0

```
**Using Winbox:** Go to *Interfaces* > *VRRP* and add VRRP interfaces. Ensure both routers have the same configuration.  For high availability, the priority of the master should be set higher than the backup unit.

**Important Notes:**
* Replace `YOUR_UPSTREAM_GATEWAY` and `your_vrrp_password` with your desired values.
* Ensure VRRP priority differs on master/backup routers.
* Implement firewall rules to protect the router and management interfaces.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):** MikroTik supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. MikroTik allows for flexible IP assignments to interfaces and the creation of subnets. This is used in conjunction with IP pools and DHCP servers to provide IP addressing to clients.
*   **IP Pools:** IP Pools are named collections of IP addresses used by DHCP servers. They define the available IP address range for dynamic allocation, can be multiple IP ranges, and can be configured for IPv4 and IPv6.
*   **IP Routing:** MikroTik routers use routing to forward traffic between different networks. Routes can be static or dynamic (using routing protocols). The routing table in MikroTik determines how to forward packets between different networks.
*   **IP Settings:** These settings control general IP-related configurations, such as forwarding options and connection tracking settings.
*   **Bridging and Switching:** MikroTik routers can bridge interfaces to create Layer 2 segments, allowing for Ethernet frames to be forwarded between interfaces.  Switch chips offer fast hardware-based switching for certain traffic.
*   **Firewall:** A core feature that provides powerful filtering capabilities based on source/destination IP, ports, protocols, and other criteria.
*   **Connection Tracking:** The connection tracking engine allows the firewall to track the state of connections and make filtering decisions.
*   **DHCP:** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, gateway addresses, and other network configuration parameters to clients on the network.
*   **NAT:** Network Address Translation allows private IP addresses to communicate with public networks using a single public IP.
