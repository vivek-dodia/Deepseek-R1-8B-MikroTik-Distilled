Disclaimer:this is going to be a rather long postHello,This guide will show you how to install and configureFastNetMonto be used with MikroTik and also as a bonus how to integrate it withSlackandGrafana, the first one is used to get reports about DDoS and the second one to have a really great reporting tool that will allow you to check PPS and Throughput as a whole and per IP address.Many thanks toPavel Odintsovfor the tool and helping out with the questions I had.BackgroundFor those of you that work in Data Center and ISP environments you're probably used to fearing about being subject to a DDoS attack or being used as a tool for one. Attacks are getting increasingly dangerous and complex. There are ways to mitigate such attacks, namely:Firewalling IPsAbsorbing the attack by having enough bandwidthRedirecting traffic to scrubbing centers (like Incapsula or Psychz)etcThose just to name a few, all of them are more or less effective depending on the type of the attack and the direction of it (coming to us or going from us). However they all share something in common, to start being effective you first need to detect the attack and know what are the affected IPs (or what the offenders are).For this there's a neat solution that's called FastNetMon, it's got two version a free version "do-it-yourself" and recently a paid version, we're going to use the free version here, in short FastNetMon can:Detect whether there's an attack in placeWhat's the direction of said attack (incoming or outgoing)What IPs are involvedMetrics about the attack, such as PPS, Mbps, type, protocols, an extract of the attack flow dataCan integrate with other tools to take different actions in case there's an attack, for instance can be used to signal devices to firewall an IP, or to broadcast a prefix via BGP that in turns black-hole traffics or triggers scrubbing centers, etc. There's even a plugin to interact with RouterOS via the API and make it program the routers to do something when it detects an attackIt can log data into Influx DB, which in turns can be used with Grafana to create really nice traffic reportsCan detect attacks either by using flow protocols (such as IPFIX, sFLOW, Netflow) and by directly inspecting mirrored trafficCan detect a lot of attack vectors, like different types of amplification attacksBasically you have a set of routers/switches that can see the network's traffic and they report said traffic to FastNetMon for it to study it and advise us regarding whether this traffic is legit or is some sort of attack.This guide will first cover the installation of all the components, namely FastNetMon, InfluxDB and Grafana and then we'll cover the corresponding configuration. In the end we'll talk about the issues we've found with the MikroTik's Implementation of Netflow (since this is the method of detection we'll use).Required HardwareWe currently have this service in production using a VPS (with ESXi as the hypervisor) with the following characteristics:8 GB of RAM500 GB HDD2 vCPUS (xeon e5450)Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS 64 bitsA single vNIC 1 GbpsWith this setup we're basically idling in terms of CPU and Ram usage. Although our traffic is "low" kept at around 250 Mbps consistently (in+out) with peaks around 800 - 950 Mbps, this is a Data Center environment with lots of flows being started and ended by the second due to the nature of the services our customers provide, this means that probably we could get away with half the specs. In terms of disk usage, we currently have around 1 month of data and it's just taking 2.5 GB of space.As for the router we only use CCR1036, but this works on any MikroTik device, our routers are basically idling in terms of CPU and RAM, even in the one with the highest load, after enabling Netflow v9 we saw an increase at most of 5 - 7% cpu usage, take into account this, Netflow is a resource heavy protocol and the resources it uses depend a lot on the traffic load the device has.Sending traffic towards the FastNetMon server (again, using Netflow v9) consumes around 1 Mbps of bandwidth with our traffic profile, the more traffic/flows the router has to process the bigger this number will be, so also take this into account when considering where to place the server and what resources you should reserve.Note:it's important that you guarantee the needed bandwidth towards the FastNetMon machine, Netflow is a stateless protocol, meaning, if traffic is lost in transit it won't recover it.1.- Installing the components and configuring the basics1.1.- FastNetMonThis is actually quite easy, I've done this a lot of times and never had a single issue, the full guide is here:https://github.com/pavel-odintsov/fastn ... INSTALL.mdIn short all you gotta do is:download the automatic installer using wget:Code:Select allwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavel-odintsov/fastnetmon/master/src/fastnetmon_install.pl -Ofastnetmon_install.plexecute itCode:Select allsudo perl fastnetmon_install.plThis will take a while to finish.Once it's done there are two main files we'll be concerned with:Networks List, located at /etc/networks_list (create it if it doesn't already exist), we need to list here in CIDR format all of our networks, one per line, if our networks were 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.2.1.0/24 then the file would end like:Code:Select all1.1.1.0/24
1.2.1.0/24fastnetmon.conflocated at /etc/fastnetmon.conf, this is the main configuration file, we'll talk more about this later1.2.- InfluxDBI followed this guide:https://diyprojects.io/influxdb-tutoria ... Z9vxlHyi03which is quite easy, all you have to do is:Code:Select allcurl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -
source /etc/lsb-release
echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install influxdbThe configuration file for influxDB is located at /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf we need to check the "graphite" section and make sure it's like the one here:Code:Select all[[graphite]]
  # Determines whether the graphite endpoint is enabled.
   enabled = true
   database = "graphite"
   retention-policy = ""
   bind-address = "127.0.0.1:2003"
   protocol = "tcp"
   consistency-level = "one"

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # Flush if this many points get buffered
   batch-size = 5000

  # number of batches that may be pending in memory
   batch-pending = 10

  # Flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit
   batch-timeout = "1s"

  # UDP Read buffer size, 0 means OS default. UDP listener will fail if set above OS max.
  # udp-read-buffer = 0

  ### This string joins multiple matching 'measurement' values providing more control over the final measurement name.
   separator = "."

  ### Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  These can be overridden at the template level
  ### or by tags extracted from metric
  # tags = ["region=us-east", "zone=1c"]

  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  There can be only one default template.
  # templates = [
  #   "*.app env.service.resource.measurement",
  #   # Default template
  #   "server.*",
  # ]
   templates = [
    "fastnetmon.hosts.* app.measurement.cidr.direction.function.resource",
    "fastnetmon.networks.* app.measurement.cidr.direction.resource",
    "fastnetmon.total.* app.measurement.direction.resource"
  ]To start the service:Code:Select allsudo service influxdb startNow to check whether it's working just type "influx" (without the quotes) and you should be greeted with a prompt1.3.- GrafanaThe guide I followed is this one:http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/I used the APT Repository.First open (with vim, vi or nano) the file/etc/apt/sources.listand then paste the following at the end:Code:Select alldeb https://packagecloud.io/grafana/stable/debian/ jessie mainSave it and then issue the following commands:Code:Select allcurl https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafanaTo start the server and make it start at boot:Code:Select allsudo service grafana-server start
sudo update-rc.d grafana-server defaultsThe Grafana by itself requires some other tweaks but we'll get to that after we get FastNetMon running, you can check whether grafana it's working by going tohttp://serverAssignedIP:30002.- Configuring the RouterYou need to first determine what routers should be sending the traffic reports to FastNetMon, depending on your network topology must be the ones that aggregate the most traffic (have the most visibility of the network), in our case these were our edge routers, then you need to define what are the interfaces to be inspected.To us the interfaces were sfp1 and sfp2, so we just did the following:Code:Select all#activating netflow and setting up the interfaces
/ip traffic-flow
set active-flow-timeout=1m cache-entries=8M enabled=yes interfaces="sfp1,sfp2"
#adding the flow-target (FastNetMon)
/ip traffic-flow target
add dst-address=FastNetMon-IP port=1234You should notice that we changed the active-flow-timeout to 1 minute from the default 15 minutes, this is because we need flow data getting into FastNetMon as fast as possible to detect the attacks, this value basically states how long the router waits to send flow resumes for still active flows to the flow-target. Also notice that we are using v9 not v5.3.- Configuring services3.1.- FastNetMonWe need to check the fastnetmon.conf file, the values we are concerned about are:Code:Select allprocess_incoming_traffic = on
process_outgoing_traffic = on
threshold_pps = 25000
threshold_mbps = 500
threshold_flows = 3500
netflow = on
average_calculation_time = 60
netflow_port = 1234
netflow_host = 0.0.0.0
graphite = on
graphite_host = 127.0.0.1
graphite_port = 2003
graphite_prefix = fastnetmon
monitor_local_ip_addresses = on
notify_script_path = /usr/local/bin/notify_about_attack.sh
enable_connection_tracking = onThe rest can be left as the default, pay special attention to the average_calculation_time which is defined in seconds and must be equal or slightly bigger than the value you set in the router as active flow timeout else it won't provide accurate information.Also the threshold values depend a lot on your traffic profiles, you need to tweak those, to us the values stated here work.There's a lot of configuration parameters here, but some of them don't apply to our setup because they're for when FastNetMon inspect traffic mirrored, read the conf file carefully, there's also a section related to exaBGP and goBGP which I won't touch just yet for reasons I'll explain later, but basically those sections would allow you to interface FastNetMon with BGP to automate blackholing prefixes or redirecting traffic to a scrubbing center.The notify script is used to take custom actions when an attack is detected, when the details of the attack are gathered and when the attack has stopped, this is a simple bash script but due to how it works the possibilities are huge. This example here is only to notify our slack channel about the attack when it start/stops and the details.Code:Select all#!/usr/bin/env bash

This seems to be something that has been reported to MikroTik but is not yet fixed (we keep using always the latest BFO images).Here's a thread  about the issue:https://github.com/pavel-odintsov/fastnetmon/issues/620We have the capacity to redirect traffic to a scrubbing center and we know that this can be automated using FastNetMon, either by the notify script or the integration with exaBGP, however we are afraid of doing it right now because of this, so we use the "manual" approach, we get a notification in our Slack channel, and someone checks out whether it makes sense, if it does we activate our defenses, if it doesn't we just ignore it, this has happened to us around 3 times this month.Here's an example:Code:Select allIP: 192.168.3.3

Average packet size for incoming traffic: 51.1 bytes 
Average packet size for outgoing traffic: 94.9 bytesThose numbers make no sense in our environment, for starters we don't have (nearly) the amount of bandwidth reported in the attack, and physically it's imposible as well since that specific host had only 1 GigE NIC.Hopefully this will work for everyone, and if it not, well we can always share knowledge over here. I'm also really interested in fixing the issue I just mentioned!

#########Updates (Jan. 2018)#########InfluxDBSince we started using this (August 2017) the space usage for the influx logs increased in just 30 GB, this means we have records for the past 5 months in just 30 GB of space, our traffic patterns now show a increase in BW usage, we're usually at around 350 - 400 Mbps (in + out).BugsWe deployed more edge routers and added them to FastNetMon, no issues so far, we get a consistent report doesn't matter if the traffic pattern is asymmetric (enters and leaves different routers)New featuresCurrently trying to gather FastNetMon data into Elasticsearch to get some neat reports, still trying to figure out how to "dump" FNM "report details" to ES. Any help would be appreciated

Are you using Netflow? if so, could you answer:1.- Have you experienced the issues I've mentioned in point 4?2.- If so, how did you manage to work around it?We basically do what you do, we just build it ourselves, eventually once we manage to bypass the issue I mentioned we'll be automating triggering scrubbing centers.

Hi!,I can't download yours .json files for grafana (I'm usinghttps://github.com/openbsod/grafana_dashboardsbut grafana show "no data points")Your post show that I no have permissions. Can you make it public or sendme by email?FastNetMon works fine with 6.38.3 with your configuration, some times show values smaller than my CCR1072, but never show huge pps values

FNM relies on the "sysUpTime" field to be sent within the flow data.  This allows FNM to get a time scale on the packet arrival.Unfortunately it seems RouterOS does not correctly send this, meaning FNM detection on flows from RouterOS is wildly inaccurate.I have a ticket open with Mikrotik for this issue [Ticket#2017010322001455]There is no ETA on a fix unfortunately

Hi nz_monkey,I don't notice anything strange at the moment.What are the real symptoms of the problem? No attacks detected? Incorrect information in fastnetmon_client?How could I see the problem?

@JeanluckI have installs of FastNetMon at 3 ISP I look after and I am seeing "False Positives" at all of them.  Clients with low average PPS rates will be detected as being under attack, even though that is not the case.I am using RouterOS 6.39.x and have seen the behavior with Netflow v9 and IPFIX flows.FYI I am working with the author of FNM who has confirmed the fault. Mikrotik support have also confirmed the fault last October , they just have not fixed it yet.

I work in a small ISP with 2500 customers, and 1Gbps-2Gbps used by them. In the last five days I have no "False Positives".At first I had false positives by huge pps. But after changing "Active Flow Timeout" to 60 seconds on the CCR and "average_calculation_time=60" on FastNetMon, as Shaoranrch said, and "false positives" disappeared.I don't know if 5 days is too short to confirm that I don't have that problem.If you can tell me how to force the bug to check, I appreciate it.

My experience with FNM and ROS is that it will give false positives on long lived TCP connections.When the long lived TCP connection (eg: large http download) completes, then the flow is exported to FNM and it suddenly sees a huge spike which falsely classifies it as an attack. AFAIK this is a ROS issue (as mentioned by jarda as well).Using FNM and ROS to detect UDP attacks works like a charm and with inactive flow timeout = 1s FNM can detect a UDP DDoS attack in practically 1-2seconds.

Hello,First I want to thank all of You for helping me with ddos attacks. I was struggling for a few days, but finally it looks like my nightmare is goneI'm using rtbh to block attacks, and until now I did that manually. Google "mikrotik rtbh" lead me to fastnetmon, and then to this post. FNM's mikrotik addon was designed for iBGP, but I needed eBGP to propagate problematic IP to my upstream isp. I modified Maximiliano's php script and finally rtbh is working like a charmI'm getting a beer nowOnce again, thank You all...

Hi,to detect UDP attacks (is my big problem now), you say "inactive flow timeout = 1s". What time are you using for "Active Timeout" and what cache entries size in "Traffic Flow Settings"?Actually I have 1 minute for active flow connection, 15 seconds for inactive flow timeout and 4M of cache entries, and FNM not detects nothing when I'm under UDP attack (or my core go down before it can send netflow to FNM to detect it...)On the other hand, for fastnetmon.conf, I have:average_calculation_time=60 (too high?)and what values are "recomended" in:"threshold_udp_mbps", "threshold_udp_pps" and the global "threshold_pps","threshold_mbps"I believe that my fastnetmon.conf is not configured correctly, if some one can "paste" one for detect UDP attacks in a few seconds I'll apreciate itMy experience with FNM and ROS is that it will give false positives on long lived TCP connections.When the long lived TCP connection (eg: large http download) completes, then the flow is exported to FNM and it suddenly sees a huge spike which falsely classifies it as an attack.

I think we found bug in Netflow v5 implementation in RouterOS: 6.40.8 Due to some issues, Mikrotik sends Netflow v5 packets with enormous amount of bytes and packets and causes false positive alerts about attacks.It looks like this way:We're starting process to report this issue to Mikrotik and work very close with customer.

You can get a little bit more precise (direct) data by decreasing the inactive flow timeout to 1s.I personally gave up on NetFlow with MikroTik for FNM. It never worked ok. It gave constant false positives for long lived TCP flows.I ended up mirroring the traffic via SPAN ports on the switch level to the FNM box. It captures everything in real time and in turn Grafana shows the most accurate graphs this way.But I still use NetFlow on MikroTik with pmacct to log the traffic each IP does which is close to the real numbers (always less though), for accounting reasons.

Yes, Mikrotik does not cut long TCP downloads / UDP transfers into smaller ones (like almost all other vendors do) and it causes huge spikes.  Recently we did some research with 60s/60s configuration with 50kpps flow and Mikrotik generated flows with 3m packets!tomasi how did you set so small limit? Previously, minimum limit for inactive/active flows was 60 seconds.

Maybe it was corrected in the new versions (that of image is 6.40.8 ).RouterOS just accepted, no complained about the 00:00:01 value

It doesn't allow smaller limitsActive Flow Timeout must be greater than 00:00:59

Hello to all Mikrotik users!We just finished a big project to deliver a completely automated way to build binary packages (deb, rpm) for all top Linux distributions. We've made this choice according to install statistics which includes the version of Linux distribution.Since today all installs which use ourrecommended install scriptwill use binary packages built for yourdistribution by us.We've prepared packages for following diretructions:Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04, 20.04Debian 8, 9, 10CentOS 6, 7, 8For all other distributions we recommend old way to compile FastNetMon from source using new fastnetmon_build.pl script.We do not use repositories and just install packages directly from our file storage. We have some plans about repositories but we decided to keep this task for future.We've prepared these packages by including some new fancy features as API support, command line client (fastnetmon_api_client) and complete GoBGP support.We recommend using GoBGP because it offers a much more reliable and scalable way to control your BGP announcements.Thank you!

It seems the FastNetMon Advanced Total traffic dashboard (https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1605) is not support anymore with the current FNM. Cause it doesnt show anything on the graph. But when I use the updated JSON which is posted by @shaoranrch (FastNet Dashes.rar) it works...Does anyone has updated version of the JSON file for FastNetMon Advanced Total traffic dashboard?
