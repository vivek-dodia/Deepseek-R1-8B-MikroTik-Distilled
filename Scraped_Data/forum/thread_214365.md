I have an SSTP server that I use from time to time, and I had thought IPv6 was working over it, but it appears not to be and I'm not sure what the problem is. The clients are assigned a valid IPv6 address and the router has a route in place for it. But I can't ping the router across the tunnel and I can't access IPv6 sites on the internet.Code:Select all[david@RoutyMcRouterson] > /ipv6 pool print

But I can't access any IPv6 sites and I can't even ping the router at its fe80 link local address. Does anyone know what might be the problem?
