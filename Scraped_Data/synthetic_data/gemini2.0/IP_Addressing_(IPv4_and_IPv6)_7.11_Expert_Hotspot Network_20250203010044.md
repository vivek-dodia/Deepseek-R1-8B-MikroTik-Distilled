## MikroTik RouterOS Expert Configuration: Hotspot Network with IPv4 and IPv6

### 1. Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**

We are configuring a Hotspot network for a small to medium business (SMB). This network will provide Wi-Fi access to clients (guests) on `wlan-65`, using a dedicated IP subnet for guest devices, with basic security and management capabilities. We will focus on IPv4 for initial configuration, and then expand upon IPv6 capabilities.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **Interface:** The Wi-Fi interface is `wlan-65` (assumed configured and operating).
*   **Subnet (IPv4):** 193.111.93.0/24
*   **Hotspot:**  Basic setup for guest access.
*   **Security:** Basic firewall rules to protect the network from the outside.
*   **Management:** Access to router via WinBox and SSH is allowed from trusted networks only.
*   **Monitoring:** Use MikroTik tools to monitor network status and troubleshoot.
*   **IPv6:** Configuration will be included for future expansion.

### 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

#### 2.1.  Setting the IPv4 Address on the Interface

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=193.111.93.1/24 interface=wlan-65 comment="Hotspot Network IP Address"
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
*   Click the `+` button.
*   In the `Address` field, enter `193.111.93.1/24`.
*   Select `wlan-65` in the `Interface` dropdown.
*   Optionally add a `Comment`.
*   Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

**Explanation:**

*   `add address=193.111.93.1/24`:  Assigns the IP address `193.111.93.1` with a `/24` netmask (255.255.255.0), which means 254 usable host IP addresses for your network (193.111.93.2-193.111.93.254)
*   `interface=wlan-65`: Specifies the Wi-Fi interface this IP address is assigned to.
*    `comment="Hotspot Network IP Address"`: Is a description of what this address is.
*   In Winbox, these parameters are filled out using the graphic interface.

#### 2.2. Setting up the DHCP Server

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=hotspot-pool ranges=193.111.93.2-193.111.93.254

/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=wlan-65 lease-time=10m name=hotspot-dhcp
```

**Winbox:**

*   Navigate to `IP` -> `Pool`.
*   Click `+`, add `hotspot-pool`, and enter `193.111.93.2-193.111.93.254` in the `Ranges` field, then click apply and `ok`.
*   Navigate to `IP` -> `DHCP Server`.
*   Click `+`.
*   Select `wlan-65` in the `Interface` dropdown.
*   Choose the newly created `hotspot-pool`.
*   Set the `Lease Time` to `10m` (10 minutes).
*   Optionally add a `Name`.
*    Click `Apply` and `OK`.

**Explanation:**

*   `/ip pool add name=hotspot-pool ranges=193.111.93.2-193.111.93.254`: Creates a pool of IP addresses that the DHCP server will assign.
*   `/ip dhcp-server add ...`: Creates a DHCP server instance.
*   `address-pool=hotspot-pool`: Links it to the defined pool.
*   `interface=wlan-65`: Specifies that the DHCP server is listening on the `wlan-65` interface.
*   `lease-time=10m`:  DHCP leases last for 10 minutes.
*    Winbox makes these parameters available in the graphical interface.

#### 2.3. Setting up the DNS Server

**CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip dns
set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to IP -> DNS.
* Check the `Allow Remote Request` checkbox
* Add `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` to the `Servers` field.
* Click `Apply` and `OK`.

**Explanation:**
* `/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes`: Enable the router to act as a DNS forwarder.
* `servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Configures the DNS to send request to public google DNS servers.

#### 2.4. Setting up Basic Firewall Rules

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid comment="Drop invalid connections"
add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related comment="Accept established connections"
add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=wlan-65 connection-state=new comment="Allow new from hotspot"
add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=wlan-65 comment="Drop all else from hotspot"

/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE comment="Masquerade NAT"
```

Replace `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` with the interface connected to the internet (e.g., `ether1`).

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to `IP` -> `Firewall`
* On `Filter Rules` tab click the `+` button, and add the filters shown above.
* On `NAT` tab, click the `+` button and add the masquerade NAT rule.

**Explanation:**

*   `/ip firewall filter`: Defines firewall rules.
*   `chain=forward`:  Specifies that these rules apply to forwarded traffic (not traffic destined to or originated from the router itself).
*   `action=drop`: Discards packets matching the rule criteria.
*   `action=accept`: Allows packets matching the rule criteria.
*   `connection-state`: A firewall rule that only acts on a connection based on its state: `invalid`, `established`, `related`, `new`.
*    `in-interface=wlan-65`: Specifies rules that will work with traffic coming from the specified interface.
*   `/ip firewall nat`: Defines Network Address Translation rules.
*   `chain=srcnat`: Specifies source NAT rules.
*   `action=masquerade`: Replaces the source IP with the IP address of the outgoing interface, effectively providing internet access.
*   `out-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE`: Specifies the interface connected to the internet.

#### 2.5. Restricting Access to the Router

### 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Problem:** Clients cannot obtain IP addresses via DHCP.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Check the DHCP server configuration (`/ip dhcp-server print`). Make sure the pool and interface are correctly configured.
        *   Verify that the DHCP server is enabled.
        *   Use `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to check for lease issues.
        *   Check the router's logs (`/system logging print`) for DHCP related messages.
        *   Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-65 protocol=udp port=67,68` to see if DHCP requests are arriving to the router.
        *   Check the client device to verify that it's trying to obtain a dynamic IP address.
*   **Problem:** Clients cannot access the internet.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Verify that the NAT rule is correctly configured for the correct outbound interface (YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE)
        *   Check the firewall rules; ensure no rules are blocking internet access.
        *   Use ping or traceroute (`/tool ping host=8.8.8.8`, `/tool traceroute host=8.8.8.8`) to test internet connectivity from the router.
        *   Check logs for any firewall drops or NAT errors (`/system logging print`).
*   **Problem:** Wireless client cannot connect to the router.
   *   **Troubleshooting:**
      * Verify that the wireless interface is enabled and working `/interface wireless print`.
      * Check the security profile used by the wireless interface `/interface wireless security-profiles print`.
      * Check the signal levels, wireless modes and frequencies.
      * Make sure the wireless client device supports the same mode and frequency used by the router.
*   **Problem:** Security concerns when the service access is granted to wide networks.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Check the IP `services` configuration and use more specific networks instead of using wide networks (e.g. `192.168.88.0/24`).
        *   Always configure a secure password for your router.

**Error Scenarios:**

*   **Incorrect NAT Interface:**  If the NAT rule points to the wrong interface, devices cannot reach the internet.
*   **Firewall Conflicts:**  Overly restrictive firewall rules can block essential traffic.
*   **DHCP Pool Exhaustion:** If the DHCP pool is too small and is exhausted, new clients can't get IP addresses.

### 5. Verification and Testing

*   **Ping:** `/tool ping host=193.111.93.200 count=4` (ping a client on the Hotspot network).  Use `/tool ping host=8.8.8.8` to test internet connectivity.
*   **Traceroute:**  `/tool traceroute host=8.8.8.8` (check path to the internet).
*   **Torch:**  `/tool torch interface=wlan-65` (monitor live traffic on the interface). Use it to see DHCP communication:  `/tool torch interface=wlan-65 protocol=udp port=67,68`.
*   **DHCP Leases:** `/ip dhcp-server lease print` (check active leases and client IPs).
*   **System Logs:** `/system logging print` (check for any errors).
*   **Resource Monitoring:** `/system resource print` to check CPU load and memory.

### 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

**Endpoint:** `/ip/address`

**Request Method:** `POST`

**Example JSON Payload (Adding an IPv4 address):**

```json
{
    "address": "193.111.93.2/24",
    "interface": "wlan-65",
    "comment": "Hotspot Test Address",
    "disabled": false
}
```

**Expected Response (Successful Creation):**

```json
{
  ".id": "*12",
   "address": "193.111.93.2/24",
   "interface": "wlan-65",
   "comment": "Hotspot Test Address",
    "disabled": false
}
```
**Example JSON Payload (Creating an IPv6 address):**

```json
{
  "address":"2001:db8:1::2/64",
  "interface":"wlan-65",
  "advertise":"yes",
  "comment":"Hotspot IPv6 address",
  "disabled": false
}
```
**Expected Response (Successful Creation):**

```json
{
  ".id": "*13",
  "address":"2001:db8:1::2/64",
  "interface":"wlan-65",
   "advertise":"yes",
  "comment":"Hotspot IPv6 address",
   "disabled": false
}

```

**Explanation:**

*   The MikroTik REST API is used for programmatic access to the router.
*   Use HTTP `POST` to create, `PUT` to modify, `DELETE` to remove, and `GET` to read.
*   The `.id` field is used to uniquely identify each entry.
*   Always configure the API secure access on the IP services configuration.

### 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):**  IP addresses are the foundation of network communication. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. The example demonstrates configuring the router with an IPv4 and IPv6 address on a Wi-Fi interface. The CIDR notation (`/24` and `/64`) specifies the subnet mask.
*   **IP Pools:**  Define a range of IP addresses for assignment to clients via DHCP.
*   **IP Routing:**  The process of forwarding packets from one network to another based on routing tables. In this scenario, we have default routing for devices on the wlan-65 to communicate through the WAN interface of the router.
*   **IP Settings:** Includes global IP settings such as DNS servers and DHCP server parameters.
*   **Bridging:** Combines multiple interfaces at the data link layer, effectively creating a switch.
*   **Firewall:**  Filters network traffic based on predefined rules to enhance security. Rules work with chains, action, connection states and interfaces, allowing for a flexible and reliable way to control what enters or exits the network.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Allows devices on a private network to access the internet via a single public IP address.

### 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use strong, unique passwords for your router's admin user.
*   **Secure Services:** Disable unnecessary services like Telnet and FTP, and limit access to essential services such as WinBox, SSH, API only from trusted networks.
*   **Firewall:** Implement a robust firewall to protect the router and the network.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep the RouterOS updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Limit Access to APIs:** Use secure HTTPS for API access and limit the source IP addresses that can make requests.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor the router's logs for unusual activities.

### 10. Detailed Explanation and Configuration Examples for Other MikroTik Topics

While the initial configuration focused on the provided parameters, let's briefly address the other topics requested, in the context of our Hotspot setup:

*   **MAC Server:**  
    *   Can be used to implement MAC address-based access restrictions or to provide static IP assignments based on the client's MAC address.
    *   Example: `/interface wireless mac-access-list add address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF action=accept` would allow that specific MAC address.
*   **RoMON:**
    *  Use it for managing remote routers using a layer-2 overlay, ideal for when routers do not have routable addresses.
    *  Example: `/tool romon set enabled=yes` then the router could be found by using RoMON in winbox
*    **Certificates:**
    * Can be used to encrypt traffic when a user access the router with HTTPS.
    * Example: `/certificate add name=mycert common-name=myrouter key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client`
*   **PPP AAA:**
    *  Used to implement AAA on PPP interfaces, a hotspot can use this to authenticate with a RADIUS server.
    *  Example: `/ppp profile add name=hotspot-profile use-encryption=yes`
*    **RADIUS:**
    * Used for centralized user authentication, often used with hotspots.
    * Example: `/radius add address=192.168.10.1 secret=secret service=ppp,hotspot,login`
*   **User / User Groups:**
    *  Can be used to limit router access or to implement user profiles with different permissions.
    * Example: `/user group add name=limited-admin policy=read,test,write` and `/user add name=newuser group=limited-admin password=newpass`

    *  Create a bridge combining interfaces:  `/interface bridge add name=bridge1` and `/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2` .
*   **MACVLAN:**
    * Create a new macvlan interface based on an existing one: `/interface macvlan add master-interface=ether1 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01 name=macvlan1`.
*  **L3 Hardware Offloading:**
    *  Enable hardware offloading: `/interface ethernet set ether1 l3-hw-offloading=yes`
*  **MACsec:**
    * Requires specific hardware that supports it: `/interface macsec set ether1 security-key=0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f10  cipher-suite=aes-128-gcm`
