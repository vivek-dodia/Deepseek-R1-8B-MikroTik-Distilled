I currently use Ubiquiti Edge Routers for distributing /24s and /26s to end users in office buildings.  I get a /24 or /26 from Cox or CL and put that on my LAN.  They give me a public IP, I think a /31 for my WAN port.  I delete the WAN firewall and remove it from the Eth0 Interface, run Eth1 into a switch, and it works great.  Of course all the hardware is going away.I'd like to standardize on MikroTik.  Can anyone recommend a good unit for taking a copper Ethernet Gig fiber circuit and distributing a public IP with 100-1000 mb/s to end users?Thanks.

taking a copper Ethernet Gig fiber circuitMaybe it is my fault. But I don't understanda) what acopper Ethernet Gig fiber circuitis it fiber or copper as far as the device is concerned?b) are you routing this traffic and doing any firewalling? or just dumping it all on a switch?
