Something isn't working while importing the old config. Hard to say what it is.You could reset the new device (what exact device do you use) without default config and then import the old config (which device was that).It should work (at least, DHCP leases are exportable and importable.

How in particular did you export and import config? Did you usebackupandrestorecommands ... orexportandimport? If the former ... then it's known (apparently not well though) that binary backups (results ofbackup) are not intended to move config from one device to another one. Specially so if source and target devices are not same model. Even if both devices are same model there are a few quirks which can interfere with normal operations after restoring configuration on target device.

Looks like the ones that are duplicated (where they got new IP) the static entry does not have a server name associated with it. e.g. dhcp1Fix that up and you should be fine.
