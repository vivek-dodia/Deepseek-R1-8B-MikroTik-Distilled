Okay, let's dive deep into configuring IP routing on a MikroTik router with the specific parameters you've provided, while also covering a broad range of MikroTik features and concepts. This will be a comprehensive guide focusing on RouterOS 7.11 (with notes on earlier versions).

## **1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:** We're setting up IP routing for a VLAN interface on an ISP router, specifically for the `8.10.44.0/24` subnet. This subnet will be assigned to the `vlan-75` interface. The router will act as a gateway for this network, providing routing and, potentially, NAT services.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (compatible with 6.48 and later 7.x)
*   **Interface:** A VLAN interface named `vlan-75` which should exist or be created for this config.
*   **Subnet:** IPv4 subnet `8.10.44.0/24`
*   **IP Address Assignment:** We will assign an IP address from the given subnet to the `vlan-75` interface.
*   **Routing:** Ensure the router is configured to route traffic to and from the assigned subnet.
*   **Functionality:** This setup will allow devices connected to this VLAN to communicate within the subnet and be routed outside as needed.
*  **Firewall:** Basic firewall rule for allowing traffic from the new subnet.

## **2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation using CLI and Winbox**

We'll present both CLI commands and Winbox steps. CLI is more precise, while Winbox provides a visual interface.

### **2.1. CLI Implementation**

*   **Step 1: Add the VLAN interface (if it doesn't exist).**
    This assumes that a physical interface is already defined (e.g., `ether1`):

    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add name=vlan-75 vlan-id=75 interface=ether1
    ```

    *Explanation:*
    * `/interface vlan`:  Navigates to the VLAN interface configuration.
    * `add name=vlan-75`: Creates a VLAN interface named `vlan-75`.
    * `vlan-id=75`: Sets the VLAN ID to 75.
    * `interface=ether1`:  Specifies the parent physical interface (replace `ether1` if necessary)

*   **Step 2: Assign an IP address to the VLAN interface.**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=8.10.44.1/24 interface=vlan-75
    ```

    *Explanation:*
        * `/ip address`: Navigates to the IP Address configuration
        * `add address=8.10.44.1/24`: Assigns the IP address `8.10.44.1` with a `/24` subnet mask.
        * `interface=vlan-75`: Assigns the IP to the previously created VLAN interface.

*   **Step 3: Add a Basic firewall rule to allow forwarded traffic from the subnet.**
    ```mikrotik
     /ip firewall filter
     add chain=forward action=accept src-address=8.10.44.0/24
     ```
     *Explanation:*
      * `/ip firewall filter`: Navigates to the firewall filter rule configuration
      * `add chain=forward`: Creates a new rule for traffic in the forwarding chain
      * `action=accept`: Accepts traffic
      * `src-address=8.10.44.0/24`: Accepts traffic from the source subnet

* **Step 4: Optional: Add a DHCP server for the subnet**

    ```mikrotik
      /ip dhcp-server
      add address-pool=dhcp_pool_75 interface=vlan-75 name=dhcp-server-75
      /ip pool
      add name=dhcp_pool_75 ranges=8.10.44.2-8.10.44.254
      /ip dhcp-server network
      add address=8.10.44.0/24 gateway=8.10.44.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```

*Explanation:*
    * `/ip dhcp-server`: Navigates to the DHCP server configuration
    * `add address-pool=dhcp_pool_75 interface=vlan-75 name=dhcp-server-75` : Creates the DHCP server instance.
    * `/ip pool`: Navigates to the IP pool configuration
    * `add name=dhcp_pool_75 ranges=8.10.44.2-8.10.44.254`: Defines IP ranges to be assigned by the DHCP server
    * `/ip dhcp-server network`: Navigates to the DHCP server network configuration
    *  `add address=8.10.44.0/24 gateway=8.10.44.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Configures the settings of the DHCP network including gateway and dns

### **2.2. Winbox Implementation**

    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.

3.  **Assign the IP Address:**
    *   Go to `IP` > `Addresses`.
    *   Click the `+` button.
    *   Enter the following:
        *   `Address`: `8.10.44.1/24`
        *   `Interface`: Select `vlan-75`
    *   Click `Apply` and `OK`.

4.  **Add the Firewall Rule:**
    *   Go to `IP` > `Firewall`
    *   Navigate to the `Filter Rules` tab.

        *   `Src Address`: `8.10.44.0/24`
    *  In the `Action` tab, enter the following:
        *   `Action`: `accept`
    *  Click `Apply` and `OK`

5.  **Optional: Add DHCP Server:**
    * Go to `IP` > `Pool`
    * Click `+` and create the pool `dhcp_pool_75` with the range `8.10.44.2-8.10.44.254`.
    *  Go to `IP` > `DHCP Server`.
    * Click `+` to add a DHCP Server
    * Enter the following
        * `Name`: `dhcp-server-75`

        * `Address Pool`: `dhcp_pool_75`
        * Click `Apply` and go to `Networks` tab
        *  Click `+` to add a network
        *  Enter the following
            *  `Address`: `8.10.44.0/24`
            * `Gateway`: `8.10.44.1`
            * `DNS servers`: `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`
        *  Click `Apply` and `OK`

## **3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

```mikrotik

/ip dhcp-server network
add address=8.10.44.0/24 gateway=8.10.44.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

## **4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall 1: VLAN Tagging Issues:** If the parent interface is not properly tagged or trunked for VLAN 75, the VLAN interface will not work correctly. Verify the port configuration of the physical interface to ensure proper VLAN forwarding on the connected switch.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use the `/interface ethernet monitor` command on the physical interface. Look for tagged packets. Check your switch configuration.

*   **Pitfall 2: IP Address Conflicts:** If `8.10.44.1/24` is used elsewhere in your network, routing issues will occur.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check your IP address allocations thoroughly. Use `/ip address print` to view current addresses.

*   **Pitfall 3: Firewall Blocking:** Ensure your firewall doesn't have rules that block communication within the 8.10.44.0/24 subnet or between the subnet and the outside world if required.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip firewall filter print` to review your firewall rules. Use `torch` to monitor traffic to and from the interface.

*   **Pitfall 4: Incorrect Routing:** If the router doesn't know where to send traffic to `8.10.44.0/24` it won't be able to forward packets. The subnet should be directly attached and thus added into the route list automatically.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip route print` and check that the route is correctly present. If it's not present verify the IP address configuration is correct.

* **Pitfall 5: Wrong interface assigned:** Assigning the incorrect physical interface to the VLAN can cause the traffic to be sent out a different interface that expected.
   * **Troubleshooting:** Verify the physical interface assignment is correct

*   **Diagnostic Tool Example (Torch):**

    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=vlan-75 duration=30
    ```

    This command will monitor traffic on the `vlan-75` interface for 30 seconds. You can watch the live output.

*   **Error Scenario:** If you mistype the interface name during IP address assignment and type `vlan-74` instead of `vlan-75` and then assign the IP `8.10.44.1/24`. The router will not be able to correctly assign the IP and routing will be misconfigured.
    *   The error will appear as `invalid value for argument address: "8.10.44.1/24", error (invalid interface)` or similar output when trying to assign the IP address.
    *   Fix: Correct the error by using `/ip address remove [find address=8.10.44.1/24]` and the adding the IP to the correct interface.

## **5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping from the Router:** Ping an address on the assigned subnet from the router.

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 8.10.44.2
    ```

    *Expect: Successful pings if a device on that IP is available*

*   **Traceroute from the Router:**  Traceroute to the outside world from the router using the source address `8.10.44.1`

    ```mikrotik
        /tool traceroute 8.8.8.8 src-address=8.10.44.1
    ```

    *Expect: The trace should work if the IP is routed correctly.*

*   **Ping from a Device on the Subnet:**  Ping the router's IP on the interface `8.10.44.1`

    *Expect: Successful pings if the network is configured correctly*
*   **Ping to the outside world:**  Ping from a device on the subnet to an external address e.g. 8.8.8.8.

    *Expect: Successful pings if the network is configured correctly.*

*   **Winbox Verification:** Check interface status, IP address assignments, and firewall rules visually in Winbox. Check connected devices on the DHCP leases.

## **6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools:** Used to define ranges of IP addresses, typically used for DHCP. We already added an IP pool for the DHCP server.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool print
    ```

*   **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF):** Allows for multiple routing tables on the same router. Useful for network segmentation. The created VLAN can be configured with a VRF to segregate traffic.
*   **Policy Based Routing:** MikroTik allows you to configure routing based on the origin or destination address and other properties of the traffic.
*   **Routing Protocols:** MikroTik supports OSPF, BGP, and RIP, allowing for complex routing in bigger networks.
* **L3 Hardware Offloading:**  If your hardware supports it, MikroTik can offload Layer 3 operations to the switch chip, increasing forwarding speed. This is usually enabled by default for newer devices. Use the `/interface ethernet print` command to check if hardware offload is enabled on an interface.
*   **Bridging and Switching:**  MikroTik can also act as a switch. The vlan interface `vlan-75` could be attached to a bridge instead of a physical interface. Bridging and routing can coexist in the same device.
*   **Limitations:** RouterOS has resource limitations, especially on older and low-end devices. For extremely high-traffic scenarios, performance might be a limiting factor.

## **7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

MikroTik's REST API allows you to manage the router programmatically.

*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Request Method:** `POST` (for adding an address)

*   **Example JSON Payload:**

    ```json
    {
      "address": "8.10.44.1/24",
      "interface": "vlan-75"
    }
    ```

*   **Example `curl` command (assuming API is enabled and user has access):**

    ```bash
    curl -k -u <username>:<password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"address": "8.10.44.1/24", "interface": "vlan-75"}' https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address
    ```

*   **Expected Response (if successful):**

    ```json
    {
      "message": "added"
     "id": "*1"
    }
    ```
    The `id` refers to the dynamically generated internal id number of the configured IP address.

* **API Endpoint to get configured IP addresses:** `/ip/address`
* **Request Method:** `GET`
* **Example `curl` command (assuming API is enabled and user has access):**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u <username>:<password>  https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address
   ```
* **Expected Response (if successful):**
```json
    [
      {
          "id": "*1",
          "address": "8.10.44.1/24",
          "interface": "vlan-75",
          "network": "8.10.44.0",
          "actual-interface": "vlan-75",
          "dynamic": "false",
          "invalid": "false"
      },
          {
            "id": "*2",
            "address": "10.10.10.1/24",
            "interface": "ether1",
            "network": "10.10.10.0",
            "actual-interface": "ether1",
            "dynamic": "false",
            "invalid": "false"
        }
    ]
```
This is an example response, the structure will be the same but the data will vary.

**Note:** You need to enable the API and configure proper authentication. API call will fail with a 401 error if not correctly configured. Use `System > API` in Winbox or `/system api print` in the command line to check the API status.

## **8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing:** Each network interface needs an IP address. The IP address identifies the interface on the network, and in conjunction with the subnet mask, specifies the network this interface belongs to. In our case, `8.10.44.1/24` means the interface IP is `8.10.44.1`, and the devices on the subnet can be `8.10.44.2-8.10.44.254`

*  **Subnet:** Used to define the available IP addresses, `/24` means the first 24 bits represent the network and the last 8 bits are for the host addresses.

*  **VLAN:** VLANs segment the network by tagging packets, this allow multiple separate virtual networks on the same physical hardware. The router then can be configured to route traffic between these networks.

*   **IP Routing:**  RouterOS uses a routing table to determine where to send traffic. Each entry contains destination network, next hop and interface. When the destination IP does not exist in the routing table, the packets can be forwarded to a default gateway, which should be configured on the router to provide connectivity to the internet. MikroTik automatically create a `/32` route for all interface IPs.

* **Firewall:** MikroTik utilizes a stateful firewall. It keeps track of established connections and can selectively allow traffic based on different criteria (source, destination, protocol, etc.). This allows for more fine-grained control over your traffic.

*   **Bridging:** A bridge groups different interfaces, passing traffic between them as a switch. This allows all interfaces on the bridge to share the same network subnet. The router can be configured to bridge or route traffic and both methods can exist in parallel.

*   **DHCP:** MikroTik's DHCP server hands out IP addresses to requesting devices, simplifying network management.
## **9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Restrict API Access:** Do not allow the API to be accessible from the public internet. Only allow access from trusted networks. Secure the API with a strong password.
*   **Use Strong Passwords:**  For all user accounts. Avoid default usernames.
*  **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS and your devices updated to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Apply appropriate firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access. Block all access to management services (e.g. Winbox, SSH) from public networks.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable services you do not need.
*   **Disable `guest` user:** This user should be disabled to avoid any unauthorized access.
*   **MAC server:**  The MAC server enables the management of the device using the MAC address. If this is not required, it should be disabled with `/tool mac-server set disabled=yes`.
*   **RoMON:** RoMON is used to access MikroTik devices from a centralized server via a dedicated protocol. If you are not using RoMON it is recommended to disable it with `/tool romon set enabled=no`.
*   **WinBox Access:**  Restrict access to WinBox through a specific IP list, or by limiting it to trusted VLANs. Configure a strong password and avoid the default one.
*  **Certificates:** If you use https access to the router you should configure and use a proper valid certificate. The router can create and use self signed certificates but these should only be used for development and test environments.
*  **PPP AAA:** When using PPP based connections, make use of proper authentication mechanisms to avoid unauthorized connections.
*  **RADIUS:** Radius servers are used to manage user credentials. Use strong passwords in the radius server. Always use TLS for communication between the device and the radius server.

## **10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for MikroTik Topics**

We'll touch on several of the key MikroTik topics you listed. Given the constraints, we will provide shorter examples for each topic and concentrate on the most pertinent aspects.

### **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)**

*   **IPv4:**  We've already covered this in our configuration examples.
*   **IPv6:** MikroTik fully supports IPv6.

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address
    add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=vlan-75
    ```
    This assigns IPv6 address `2001:db8::1/64` to vlan-75 interface.

### **IP Pools**

We've already used IP Pools for DHCP:

```mikrotik
/ip pool print
```

### **IP Routing**

We've covered this already. Use `/ip route print` to view and `/ip route add` to add specific routes.

### **IP Settings**
The IP settings page is a way to configure general networking configurations.
```mikrotik
/ip settings
set allow-fast-path=yes
```
This will enable the fast path which can increase the forwarding speed on devices with L3 hardware offloading.

### **MAC server**
The MAC server allows management of MikroTik devices from Winbox using their MAC addresses.
```mikrotik
/tool mac-server print
```
This will display the current settings. It's recommended to disable it using `/tool mac-server set disabled=yes` if you are not using this functionality.

### **RoMON**
The RoMON protocol allows you to access MikroTik devices from a central server or another router.
```mikrotik
/tool romon print
```
It's recommended to disable it if not in use with `/tool romon set enabled=no`

### **WinBox**
WinBox is a windows program for managing RouterOS devices. The access to WinBox can be limited to specific IP addresses.
```mikrotik
/ip service print
```
This will show all running services, make sure to properly configure the `winbox` service access address to limit access.

### **Certificates**
Certificates are used to enable encrypted HTTPS access to the router.

```mikrotik
/certificate print
```
This will display all installed certificates. You can import new certificates or create self-signed ones using this interface.

### **PPP AAA**
PPP AAA is used to provide authentication, authorization, and accounting for dial-in users.

```mikrotik
/ppp profile print
```
This shows defined PPP profiles. You can create new ones with `/ppp profile add`.

### **RADIUS**
A radius server can be used for AAA for PPP, hotspot, and other user types.
```mikrotik
/radius print
```
This shows the configured radius servers. You can add a new radius server with `/radius add`.

### **User / User groups**
MikroTik allows you to define different users and user groups with specific permissions.
```mikrotik
/user print
```
This shows all configured users. You can configure new users and set user groups using the `/user add` command.

### **Bridging and Switching**

*   **Bridging:** Connect interfaces to the same Layer 2 domain:

    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge
    add name=bridge1
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
    add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
    ```

*   **Switching:** Configure VLANs on a switch chip if present:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ethernet switch vlan print
    ```

### **MACVLAN**

* Creates a virtual interface with a different MAC address on an existing interface.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface macvlan
    add mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01 master-interface=ether1 name=macvlan1
    ```
    This command creates the macvlan interface `macvlan1` with a specific MAC address.

### **L3 Hardware Offloading**
When the hardware supports it, layer 3 hardware offloading can significantly increase performance of the router. Check if offloading is enabled using:
```mikrotik
/interface ethernet print
```
The `hw` column indicates if hardware offloading is enabled.

### **MACsec**
MACsec enables layer 2 encryption of ethernet links.
```mikrotik
/interface macsec print
```
This will display MACsec configurations.

### **Quality of Service**
QoS allows controlling the bandwidth usage of the network.
```mikrotik
/queue simple print
```
This will display the configured simple queues. You can also configure more complicated HTB queues using the `/queue tree print` command.

### **Switch Chip Features**
Many of MikroTik devices contain specialized switch chips which offer enhanced layer 2 functionality. This can be configured using the `/interface ethernet switch` menu.

### **VLAN**
VLANs enable the creation of logically separated networks on the same physical interface. We already configured VLAN in our main example.

### **VXLAN**
VXLAN extends the VLAN functionality with a method to encapsulate Ethernet layer 2 packets into UDP packets to traverse layer 3 networks.
```mikrotik
/interface vxlan print
```
This command shows the existing VXLAN configurations.

### **Firewall and Quality of Service**

*   **Connection Tracking:** Tracks active connections, allowing stateful firewall rules.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall connection print
    ```
*   **Firewall:**  We've covered filter rules. NAT rules are also important for internet access:

    ```mikrotik
    /ip dns
    set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```

*   **SOCKS Proxy:** Allow proxy connections, use with caution, may expose the router to security risks.
*   **Web Proxy:** Enable caching of web pages, use with caution, may expose the router to security risks.

### **High Availability Solutions**

*   **Load Balancing:**  Use multiple WAN links for redundancy.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip route add gateway=x.x.x.x routing-mark=wan1
    /ip route add gateway=y.y.y.y routing-mark=wan2
    /ip firewall mangle
    add chain=prerouting in-interface=ether2 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=wan1
    add chain=prerouting in-interface=ether3 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=wan2
    ```
*   **Bonding:** Combine multiple interfaces for higher bandwidth or redundancy.

    ```mikrotik
    /interface bonding
    add name=bond1 mode=802.3ad slaves=ether2,ether3
    ```
*   **VRRP:** Use for high-availability of router.

    ```mikrotik

      add connect=yes disabled=no interface=lte1 password=test user=test
    ```
*   **GPS:**  Use for tracking or accurate time synchronization.
*   **SMS:**  Can send and receive SMS messages for notifications.
*   **Dual SIM:** Used for seamless failover between providers.

### **Multi Protocol Label Switching - MPLS**

*   **MPLS Overview:**  Provides faster and more flexible routing.
*   **LDP:**  Used for dynamic label distribution.
    ```mikrotik
        /mpls ldp
        set enabled=yes
    ```
*   **VPLS:**  Provides layer 2 VPN over an MPLS network.
    ```mikrotik
        /interface vpls
        add name=vpls1 remote-peer=192.168.1.2
    ```
* **Traffic Eng:** Allows finer control over the traffic path inside an MPLS network.

        /routing ospf network
        add network=192.168.1.0/24 area=backbone
   ```
*   **BGP:** Used for inter-AS routing.
    ```mikrotik
    /routing bgp instance
    add name=bgp1 as=65000 router-id=192.168.1.1
    /routing bgp peer
    add instance=bgp1 remote-address=192.168.1.2 remote-as=65001
    ```
*   **RIP:** Older and less common interior gateway protocol.
*  **Moving from ROSv6 to v7:** ROSv7 significantly changed the way routing is handled internally, and migration will require knowledge of the new features.
* **Policy Routing:** allows routing traffic based on rules and criteria that are not destination IP based.
*  **Virtual Routing and Forwarding - VRF:** Used for network segmentation and routing table isolation.
*   **RPKI:** Helps protect against BGP prefix hijacking.
*   **Route Selection and Filters:** Control routes using filters.
*  **Multicast:** Configure multicast routing and forwarding.
*   **Routing Debugging Tools:** Use logging and packet capture to debug routing issues.

### **System Information and Utilities**

*   **Clock:** Set time zone and configure NTP.
    ```mikrotik
        /system clock print
    ```
    Set the timezone with `/system clock set time-zone-name=<timezone>`
*   **Device-mode:** Controls hardware mode, such as `router` or `switch`.
*   **E-mail:** Configure email for notifications.
*  **Fetch:** Enables downloading files from remote locations.
*   **Files:**  Manage files on the router.
*   **Identity:**  Set router identity, used in Winbox.

    ```mikrotik
    /system identity set name=my-router
    ```
*   **Interface Lists:** Group interfaces for easier configuration and use in firewall rules.
*  **Neighbor discovery:** allows finding other routers and switches.
*   **Note:** Add notes to the configuration.
*   **NTP:** Configure NTP client for time sync.
   ```mikrotik
       /system ntp client
       set enabled=yes server-address=pool.ntp.org
   ```
*   **Partitions:** Configure storage partitions.
*  **Precision Time Protocol:** Used for high precision time synchronization.
*   **Scheduler:** Schedule tasks to run on the router.
    ```mikrotik
        /system scheduler
        add name=my_script interval=1h start-time=startup on-event=script
    ```
*   **Services:** Configure allowed management services (e.g., Winbox, SSH, HTTP).
    ```mikrotik
     /ip service print
    ```
*   **TFTP:** Enable TFTP server.

### **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**

*   **6to4, EoIP, GRE, IPIP:**  Tunneling protocols, with different requirements and use-cases.
*   **IPsec:** Create encrypted tunnels.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip ipsec peer add address=x.x.x.x secret=<shared_secret>
    /ip ipsec proposal add name=my-proposal auth-algorithms=sha1 enc-algorithms=aes-128-cbc lifetime=30m
    /ip ipsec policy add peer=<peer_name> proposal=my-proposal
    ```
*   **L2TP:**  Layer 2 VPN protocol.
    ```mikrotik
        /interface l2tp-server server
        set enabled=yes use-ipsec=yes
   ```
*   **OpenVPN:**  Flexible VPN solution.
    ```mikrotik
        /interface ovpn-server server
        add mode=ip server-address=10.10.10.1/24 protocol=tcp port=1194
   ```
*   **PPPoE:** Use for dial-up broadband connections.
*   **PPTP:** Older VPN protocol, less secure.
*   **SSTP:** Secure VPN over HTTPS.
*   **WireGuard:** Newer, faster VPN protocol.
    ```mikrotik
        /interface wireguard
        add name=wireguard1 private-key=<private_key>
        /interface wireguard peers
        add allowed-address=10.10.10.2/32 endpoint=10.10.10.1:51820 interface=wireguard1 public-key=<peer_public_key>
  ```
*   **ZeroTier:**  SD-WAN for simple VPN deployment.

### **Wired Connections**
