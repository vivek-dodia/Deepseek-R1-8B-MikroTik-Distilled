Hello again, and Happy New Year to everyone.Hope you are all doing great !I have a very weird problem with my LHG-LTE18 and I wanted to know if there is anywhere I can start, in order to find the problem.The setup (briefly):LHG-LTE18 acting as modem, on passthrough mode. 1 VLAN for net traffic, 1 for management.RB5009 acting as router. (same VLANS as above set up there. I followed Mikrotik's guide on YouTube)CSS326-25G as my Switch, connected to the 5009 via SFP.My ISP is Comsote Greece.The problem:Every so often (and it's getting TOO often) my internet connection just gets super slow in terms of Ping.General Speeds are down too, but it does work, and it does get up to relatively high speeds.But latency, is just SECONDS.When trying to access the LHG, everything "lags" and I can't really access it properly. Commands take seconds to complete, and sometimes I have no access at all. It's the same story both from Winbox AND from Telnet. Or using a browser to access the webgui, or just pinging the device from my router. It takes ages. It also doesn't matter if I use the MAC to access it.Restarting the Modem, INSTANTLY fixes the issue like nothing happened.More info:- This happened first time like 6 months ago. Then 5 months ago. Then again in 20 days.Long story short, it's no happening probably every hour. I didn't bother looking into it in the beginning as I thought it was something random.- The logs in the device, mention nothing, although I did see that you can setup one billion topics on System>Logging.I don't know which one I SHOULD activate though to catch a potential problem.- During the problem, I don't notice any out of the ordinary CPU Usage or something.Any advice on how to solve the issue would be helpful.I am one step away from losing my mind over this.PS. I'm gonna post a video down bellow, although I described the issue, and you don't need to watch it.It just shows what I said. The device is lagging hard, and rebooting it, instantly goes back to normal.EDIT: Here's a video:https://streamable.com/1o22au(I forgot I had a mic, so I was typing on notepad like a retard)

It's hard to trouble shoot behaviour which happens only rarely. When it happens next time, don't forget to thoroughly check the logs, there might be something in it. Another thing to do is tocreate supout.rif fileand send it to Mikrotik support ... they might decode the device state and comment on what might have happened.I'd suggest you to make sure your device is running latest stable ROS version (if your device is currently running v6, then that would be 6.49.17; if your device is running v7, then that would be 7.16.2). Make sure routerboot (System->Routerboard) is upgraded as well. There are some firmware upgrades available for LTE modems as well, consultLTE modem upgrade guideto see how that is performed.If software/firmware upgrades don't make a difference, then you can implement a work-around usingnetwatch... netwatch, running on LHG itself, might be able to detect sluggishness and reboot device ... in this case the service impact will likely be much shorter than with manual reboots.

Hello and thanks for taking interest into my problem !Well, for starters I wouldn't say the problem happens "rarely".It happens every day, and sometimes like 5 times in a single night.It won't be long until it happens again.The normal logs, have nothing that might indicate any error or something.Every single message I read is normal, like user logins, or IPs from the DHCP Client etc.That's why I asked if I could maybe enable any specific (extra) logging. Like we do when debugging devices.I am running ROS 7.16.1.It doesn't show me any .2 update.The modem is also updated to the latest firmware according the device.(EG18EAPAR01A13M4G_01.002.01.002)A workaround won't really cut it for me to be honest.I can also instruct my Home Assistant to cut power to the modem and restart it if network issues arise, or create a script that does the same thing via telnet. I am not looking to find a workaround.I'm looking for the cause.And If I'm being honest, it's driving me insane since I paid nearly 4 digits for my network setup to avoid these kind of problems.I was dealing with stuff like this with my ISPs (free) router.Anyway, I will try the supout.rif file you said, and take it from there.I don't know what else to do.

I'd make sure you also upgraded the firmware in /system/routerboot to match.If that matches, then... it may be worth it do a backup, and upgrade to the "testing" channel with 7.17rc.  I recall others some issues with LHG specifically in 7.16 or 715, so doing another search through forum may be also of use.  Generally speaking, some version is stable, whether it's called stable or not- but you do want all 3 versions of aligned (RouterOS, RouterBOOT, and LTE firmware).If you do create a support case, I'd recommend increasing the loging via /system/log/add topics=lte,!packet which will capture additional LTEs logs.  Also it might be helpful a couple supout.rifs, once after boot up & once when the problem occurs.  But the supout.rif will include the low-level LTE logs if you enabling that in logging, which no doubt will help MT support figure it out.

Hey there !I enabled the two extra logging topics you mentioned and I will take a couple rifs as you said.As for the System/routerboot I can't find anything like that.According to this:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... RouterBOOTit looks like RouterBOOT, is updated alongside "RouterBoard" correct  ?I upgraded everything to 7.16.2 and I'll hope for the best.And if this fails, I will try the 7.17rc6 and see what happens.I can't figure out any other path.Thanks for the input though. I appreciate it. <3

Sorry, /system/routerboardis where you upgrade the firmware (but the "firmware"/BIOS is called RouterBOOT).

According to this:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... RouterBOOTit looks like RouterBOOT, is updated alongside "RouterBoard" correct  ?"alongside" as in "is downloaded as part of RouterOS", yes."alongside" as in "is actually installed together with RouterOS", no.So to be able to flash a new version of routerboot, you first have to install a new version of RouterOS (which requires a reboot); once you flash the routerboot usingsystem routerboard upgrade, you have to reboot again in order that the new routerboot would be actually used.

The issue is likely caused by either a saturated connection, interference, or a potential misconfiguration in the Mikrotik LHG. Restarting the modem resolves it temporarily, which suggests the problem may be with the modem or its interaction with the LHG.

Sorry, /system/routerboardis where you upgrade the firmware (but the "firmware"/BIOS is called RouterBOOT).yis sir ! I figured !"alongside" as in "is downloaded as part of RouterOS", yes."alongside" as in "is actually installed together with RouterOS", no.So to be able to flash a new version of routerboot, you first have to install a new version of RouterOS (which requires a reboot); once you flash the routerboot usingsystem routerboard upgrade, you have to reboot again in order that the new routerboot would be actually used.Yes I understood that after your inputs on the matter. I didn't know that was the way, up till yesterday.I thought everything was updated all together and I just need to update the modem manual on devices like the LHG.Thanks for clarifying that.The issue is likely caused by either a saturated connection, interference, or a potential misconfiguration in the Mikrotik LHG. Restarting the modem resolves it temporarily, which suggests the problem may be with the modem or its interaction with the LHG.After updating it to the latest version yesterday, it has been running since. FINGERS CROSSED !If it doesn't get any fever tonight or tomorrow I think that might have fixed it.I haven't changed any configuration since I first configured the device. It's running on Passthrough mode as I said, so the only config, was the two VLANs, for which I followed step-by-step Mikrotik's guide on YouTube.That being said, I wasn't checking for updates viaSystem > Packagesor viaQuickSet Menu > Check For Updates.I was only trying to update fromSystem > RouterBoardwhich as you guys indicated only tried to update RouterBOOT, using the "bundled firmware" inside v7.16.2.That's why I said "I am not seeing any updates other than 16.1". I was looking at the wrong place.Everything is Clear now in terms of how the device needs to be Updated.Thank you.FINGERS CROSSED. I will post results.If it dies on me again, or not, I will inform you.Thanks AGAIN ! Love you all. <3

I'm not sure you followed the first response of @mkx - what does/interface/lte/firmware-upgrade lte1 upgrade=noshow?You mean about the Modem's Firmware update.This Link:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... areupgradeYeah I did follow that !It Shows:installed: EG18EAPAR01A13M4G_01.002.01.002latest: EG18EAPAR01A13M4G_01.002.01.002But that was already updated since the last time I updated the modem a few months ago.It had no new update now.

Yeah point being there are three possible places to update:1. /system/package2. /system/routerboard/update3. /interface/lte/firmware-upgrade& with LTE likely best ALL align (and/or at latest stable), since over many releases I have see weird things with LTE (no showing up, not running, disappear, etc. etc) when versions are different.

I'll post again in a later time for results !Thanks again guys.

So... Greetings again !I have updates !I did update the OS to 7.17 and it did look like the issue went away, but then it happened again, just much later rather than every single hour or so.Then after checking daily, there was finally a new update for theModem's firmware.I updated that too, and now, it has been running for a week or so, with no problems.mt.PNGI REALLY hope this fixes things, cause it was starting to get annoying.That being said, I changed ZERO settings whatsoever. As far as configuration.I just updated the device, and the modem. Nothing else.Thank you all for your time and patience.Have a nice day, folks!!
