It is strongly recommended to upgrade the bootloader after RouterOS update. To upgrade the bootloader, execute command "/system routerboard upgrade" in CLI, followed by a reboot. Alternatively, navigate to the GUI System → RouterBOARD menu and click the "Upgrade" button, then reboot the device.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... stallation

If he's using Mellanox NICs he's obviously using either ROSx86 on bare metal or CHR. You can't update RouterBOARD firmware on either.@geekera1n, nanobahr: contactsupport@mikrotik.comand link them to this thread.

I’m encountering the same issue! I upgraded to RouterOS v7.17 and Winbox 4 simultaneously and initially assumed it was a display bug in Winbox 4. However, it appears to be a problem with RouterOS v7.17. I’m running CHR on RouterOS and upgraded from v7.16.2 to v7.17. The NIC I’m using is a CX4121A (Mellanox ConnectX-4 Lx). Although the interface status shows “unsupported speed,” the link itself functions normally. Interestingly, when I enable Auto Negotiation, the “unsupported speed” message disappears, but the link speed fails to negotiate properly. This NIC has a known long-standing issue with auto-negotiation, so I have always configured the speed manually. The sudden appearance of the “unsupported speed” message is therefore quite confusing.

Mikrotik support says that this will be fixed when the v7.18beta3 comes out.
