# Analysis Process
Okay, let's tackle this MikroTik RIP troubleshooting scenario. The user wants a detailed case for a SOHO network with connectivity loss affecting 953 users over 15 hours. The RouterOS version is 6.x, and the subnet is 172.23.80.128/25. Let's break down each section as per the requirements.

First, the initial problem report. Symptoms would include users losing internet, inability to reach certain subnets, maybe RIP routes missing. Since it's an edge location, maybe the RIP isn't propagating routes correctly. Need to think about what could cause that.

For the environment description, a SOHO network probably has a MikroTik router as the edge device connected to an ISP. There might be a couple of internal switches and a firewall. Let me sketch a simple Mermaid diagram with the router, ISP, internal network, and maybe a firewall.

Initial assessment steps: Check interfaces, RIP status, routing table, neighbor adjacencies. Use commands like /interface print, /routing rip neighbor print, /ip route print. Maybe look at logs for any RIP-related errors.

Debugging process: Need to check RIP configuration. Verify that the correct interfaces are enabled for RIP. Check version compatibilityâ€”since it's RIP, maybe v1 vs v2 issues. Authentication if any. Look at the network statements. Use commands like /routing rip instance print, /routing rip interface print. Maybe enable debugging logs with /log print where topics=rip.

Key findings could be a misconfigured RIP network statement not including the correct subnet, or an interface missing from RIP configuration. Maybe a passive interface setting or split horizon issue. Root cause analysis would tie that to the configuration error leading to routes not being advertised.

Solution steps: Correct the network statement in RIP configuration, add the proper interface, adjust version settings. Show before and after config snippets.

Verification: Check routes again, test connectivity, monitor RIP neighbors. Use /ip route print and /ping.

Prevention measures: Regular config audits, enabling logging for RIP, using authentication, version consistency.

Related commands: List all the commands used, like interface print, routing rip stuff, log viewing.

Common pitfalls: Forgetting to add interfaces to RIP, version mismatches, network statements not covering subnets, split horizon in NBMA networks.

Wait, the subnet given is 172.23.80.128/25. Maybe the RIP configuration was set to advertise a different network, like 172.23.80.0/24, but the actual subnet is /25. So the RIP network statement might have been 172.23.80.0/24, which includes the /25, but maybe the router isn't advertising the specific /25 because of that. Or maybe the interface is on 172.23.80.129, but the network statement in RIP is missing.

Also, in RouterOS 6.x, the RIP configuration is under /routing rip. Need to make sure that the network is properly defined in the RIP instance. Maybe the initial config had a typo in the network address.

Let me structure each section step by step, making sure to include CLI commands with comments. For example, when checking RIP neighbors, the command is /routing rip neighbor print. If there are no neighbors, that's a problem. Or if the neighbor is down.

Including log outputs: Maybe after enabling logging, you see "RIP: no enabled interfaces" or something. Or authentication failures if that's a factor.

Before and after configurations: Show the RIP instance before had network=172.23.80.0/24 and after corrected to 172.23.80.128/25. Or the interface wasn't added to RIP.

Also, considering the environment is an edge location, maybe the WAN interface was accidentally included in RIP, causing routes to be advertised externally, but that might not cause connectivity loss. Alternatively, the internal interface wasn't included, so routes aren't being advertised to internal networks.

I need to ensure that all parts of the query are addressed. The user mentioned 953 users affected for 15 hours, which is a long time, so maybe a misconfiguration that wasn't obvious. The key is the RIP configuration not advertising the correct subnet, leading to other routers not knowing how to reach it, hence connectivity loss.

Alright, let's put this all together in the specified format, making sure each section is covered with relevant details, commands, and examples.

# Troubleshooting Guide

# MikroTik RouterOS Troubleshooting Scenario: RIP Connectivity Loss

## 1. Initial Problem Report and Symptoms
**Report**: Sudden loss of internet/remote connectivity for 953 users at SOHO edge site.  
**Symptoms**:  
- No internet access or access to remote subnets via RIP-learned routes.  
- Local LAN (`172.23.80.128/25`) functional.  
- RIP routes missing from routing table.  
- No physical layer issues (confirmed via ISP).

## 2. Environment Description & Network Topology
**Network Type**: SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)  
**Edge Device**: MikroTik RB2011 (RouterOS v6.49.7)  
**Subnet**: `172.23.80.128/25` (LAN)  
**ISP Connection**: Static IP via ether1 (WAN).

## 3. Initial Assessment Steps
1. **Verify Interface Status**:  
   ```bash
   /interface print
   ```
   **Output**:  
   ```text
   NAME    TYPE       MTU  STATUS  
   ether1  ether      1500 up      
   ether2  ether      1500 up      
   ```

2. **Check RIP Configuration**:  
   ```bash
   /routing rip instance print
   /routing rip interface print
   ```

3. **Review Routing Table**:  
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=rip
   ```
   **Output**: No RIP routes listed.

4. **Check RIP Neighbors**:  
   ```bash
   /routing rip neighbor print
   ```
   **Output**: `0 neighbors found`.

## 4. Detailed Debugging Process
### Step 1: Enable RIP Debugging
```bash
/log print where topics=rip
```
**Log Output**:  
```text
00:00:01 rip,error No enabled RIP interfaces
```

### Step 2: Validate RIP Network Statements
```bash
/routing rip instance print
```
**Output**:  
```text
0 name="default" redistribute=static,ospf,connected routing-table=main
   networks=172.23.80.0/24
```

**Issue**: Misconfigured network (`172.23.80.0/24` instead of `/25`).  

### Step 3: Verify RIP Interface Bindings
```bash
/routing rip interface print
```
**Output**: No interfaces bound to RIP instance.  

---

## 5. Key Findings & Root Cause Analysis
**Root Cause**:  
- **Misconfigured RIP Network**: Network statement `172.23.80.0/24` included the LAN subnet (`172.23.80.128/25`) but prevented RouterOS from advertising the specific `/25` route.  
- **Missing Interface Binding**: No interfaces were added to the RIP instance, causing no route advertisements.  

**Impact**:  
- RIP routes not propagated to upstream routers.  
- Return traffic to `172.23.80.128/25` blocked at ISP edge.  

---

## 6. Solution Implementation Steps
### Before Configuration:
```bash
/routing rip instance set [find] networks=172.23.80.0/24
/routing rip interface print  # No entries
```

### After Configuration:
1. **Correct RIP Network**:  
   ```bash
   /routing rip instance set [find] networks=172.23.80.128/25
   ```

2. **Bind LAN Interface to RIP**:  
   ```bash
   /routing rip interface add interface=ether2
   ```

---

## 7. Verification Process
1. **Confirm RIP Routes**:  
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=rip
   ```
   **Output**: RIP routes reappear (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0` via ISP gateway).  

2. **Test Connectivity**:  
   ```bash
   /ping 8.8.8.8 count=5
   ```
   **Output**: 5/5 packets received.  

3. **Validate RIP Neighbors**:  
   ```bash
   /routing rip neighbor print
   ```
   **Output**: ISP router now listed as neighbor.  

---

## 8. Prevention Measures
1. Use explicit subnets in RIP network statements (e.g., `/25` instead of `/24`).  
2. Enable RIP logging:  
   ```bash
   /system logging add topics=rip
   ```
3. Schedule monthly configuration audits.

## 9. Related Commands Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/routing rip instance print` | List RIP instances |
| `/routing rip interface print` | Show RIP-enabled interfaces |
| `/ip route print where protocol=rip` | Display RIP-learned routes |
| `/log print where topics=rip` | View RIP-specific logs |

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Overlapping Networks**: Avoid broad network statements (e.g., `/24` instead of `/25`).  
2. **Passive Interfaces**: Ensure WAN interfaces are excluded from RIP.  
3. **Version Mismatch**: Use `version=2` for CIDR support.  
4. **Authentication**: Enable MD5 auth if ISP requires it.  
```bash
/routing rip interface set [find] authentication=md5 auth-key=secret123
```
```
