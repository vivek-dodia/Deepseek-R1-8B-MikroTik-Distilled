Hi,This router should be 1700MHz according to the datasheet.Or did i got the fast one?Cheers,HarryCode:Select all[admin@x]/system/resource>printuptime:4m25sversion:7.16.2(stable)build-time:2024-11-2612:09:40factory-software:7.15free-memory:3764.3MiBtotal-memory:4096.0MiBcpu:ARM64

Nominal CPU frequency is 1700MHz. But it's possible to overclock it by setting/system/routerboard/settings set cpu-frequency=<value>. Nowdays default setting isautowhich allows ROS to scale frequency up or down depending on CPU core load. Sometimes this doesn't work too well (it takes sone time to scale up and during that period of time router performance lags somehow).

I checked it, winbox doesn't show that option.CLI kind of the same:Code:Select all[admin@x]/system/routerboard/settings>setcpu-frequency=1700input doesnotmatch anyvalueofcpu-frequency[admin@x]/system/routerboard/settings>setcpu-frequency=2000input doesnotmatch anyvalueofcpu-frequency[admin@x]/system/routerboard/settings>setcpu-frequency=autoinput doesnotmatch anyvalueofcpu-frequency[admin@x]/system/routerboard/settings>setcpu-frequency=[admin@x]/system/routerboard/settings>Running export doesn't show any changes to the default.I guess its a cosmetic bug.

If you useset cpu-frequency= and then TABwhat options do you get ?

Also check settings in/system/device-mode... Ithinkyou have to enablerouterboardproperty to change cpu frequency setting ... just don't know which particular ROS version started to require that (could be it's 7.17).

I get zero options. It like it did not press TAB.If you useset cpu-frequency= and then TABwhat options do you get ?

That's a good one.. but it seems i can not see the values. Maybe this is from v7.17 and later.I'm running v7.16.2Code:Select all[admin@x]/system/device-mode>printmode:enterpriseAlso check settings in/system/device-mode...

I'm running v7.16.2Then yeah, you're locked by default.Code:Select all/system/device-mode/update routerboard=yesbeware, you will be forced to reboot- it tells you to unplug power or press button, but pressing button will reboot.After the reboot, you will have settings available in/system/routerboard/set.And if you do/system/device-mode/print, it will say something like:Code:Select allmode:enterprise
  routerboard:yes

HiI have upgrade and change the device mode.But nothing really change still the wrong value and no way to adjust it.Cheers,HarryCode:Select all[admin@MR1]/system/device-mode>printmode:advanced

You can't set CPU frequency like this?Code:Select all/system/routerboard/settings/setcpu-frequency=auto(or press <TAB> before enteringautoto see possible values)
