Okay, let's craft some detailed documentation for configuring IP routing on a MikroTik router, targeting RouterOS 7.11 (and mentioning 6.48 and 7.x compatibility), with a specific focus on the given scenario.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario involves configuring basic IP routing for a VLAN interface on a MikroTik router. We have a network with the subnet `92.210.3.0/24` that will be associated with a VLAN interface named `vlan-25`. This VLAN interface will require an IP address to allow devices within this network to communicate. We will ensure basic connectivity by allowing devices on this vlan to use the router as a gateway. This configuration serves as the foundation for network segmentation and allows the router to act as a router in a local area network.

## Implementation Steps:

This configuration assumes that the VLAN interface `vlan-25` is already created on your router. However, we will provide the commands to create that as well. If the interface doesn't exist, follow Step 1.

1.  **Step 1: (Optional) Create the VLAN Interface**

    *   **Description:** If the VLAN interface `vlan-25` does not yet exist, we must create it. This involves assigning a VLAN ID to a physical interface (usually an Ethernet port) creating a virtual interface associated with that physical interface.

    *   **Before:** We check what interfaces exist on the router.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface print
    ```
    *Example Output*:
    ```
    Flags: D - dynamic ; R - running; X - disabled; I - inactive
      #     NAME                                  TYPE      MTU   L2MTU   MAX-L2MTU
      0 R   ether1                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
      1 R   ether2                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
      2 R   ether3                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
    ```

    *   **Action:** We use the `/interface vlan` command to create the vlan interface. Replace `ether2` with the physical interface your VLAN should be on.

    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan add name=vlan-25 vlan-id=25 interface=ether2
        ```
        *   `name=vlan-25`: Sets the name of the interface to `vlan-25`.
        *   `vlan-id=25`: Sets the VLAN ID to 25.
        *   `interface=ether2`: Specifies that `vlan-25` will be created on `ether2`.

    *   **After:** We can verify the existence of the vlan-25 interface with the following command.
        ```mikrotik
        /interface print
        ```
        *Example Output*:
        ```
        Flags: D - dynamic ; R - running; X - disabled; I - inactive
        #     NAME                                  TYPE      MTU   L2MTU   MAX-L2MTU
        0 R   ether1                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
        1 R   ether2                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
        2 R   ether3                                 ether     1500  1598    9194
        3 R   vlan-25                              vlan      1500  1598    9194
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Navigate to `Interfaces`.
        *   Click the "+" button and select `VLAN`.
        *   Set the `Name` to `vlan-25`.
        *   Set the `VLAN ID` to `25`.
        *   Select the `Interface` to `ether2`.
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`.

2.  **Step 2: Assign an IP Address to the VLAN Interface**

    *   **Description:** Now we assign an IP address to the VLAN interface to make it an active participant in the network. This address will act as the default gateway for devices in the 92.210.3.0/24 subnet.

    *   **Before:** We check for the presence of an IP address with the command
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print
    ```
    *Example Output*:
    ```
    Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
    #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
    ```

    *   **Action:** We use the `/ip address add` command to assign an IP address to `vlan-25`. For this example, we will use 92.210.3.1/24.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address add address=92.210.3.1/24 interface=vlan-25
        ```
        *   `address=92.210.3.1/24`: Sets the IP address to `92.210.3.1` with a `/24` subnet mask.
        *   `interface=vlan-25`: Assigns the IP address to the `vlan-25` interface.

    *   **After:** We can verify the assigned address with
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address print
        ```
        *Example Output*:
        ```
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
        #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
        0   92.210.3.1/24      92.210.3.0      vlan-25
        ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Navigate to `IP` > `Addresses`.
        *   Click the "+" button.
        *   Set the `Address` to `92.210.3.1/24`.
        *   Select the `Interface` to `vlan-25`.
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`.

3.  **Step 3: Ensure IP Forwarding is Enabled**

    *   **Description:** This step is crucial. MikroTik does not enable IP forwarding by default. In order for the router to act as a router, it has to forward packets between its network interfaces.
    *   **Before:** Check the current state of IP forwarding:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip settings print
        ```
        Look for the `ip-forward` parameter. It will likely be set to "no".

    *   **Action:** Enable IP forwarding using the `/ip settings set` command.

    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip settings set ip-forward=yes
        ```
        *   `ip-forward=yes`: Sets IP forwarding to enabled.

    *   **After:**
    Check the status again
        ```mikrotik
        /ip settings print
        ```
        The `ip-forward` should now show as "yes".

    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Navigate to `IP` > `Settings`.
        *   Check the box for `Enable IP Forwarding`.
        *   Click `Apply` then `OK`.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
# Create VLAN interface (if needed)
/interface vlan add name=vlan-25 vlan-id=25 interface=ether2

# Assign IP address to the VLAN interface
/ip address add address=92.210.3.1/24 interface=vlan-25

# Enable IP forwarding
/ip settings set ip-forward=yes
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **VLAN ID Mismatch:** Ensure the VLAN ID configured on the MikroTik matches the VLAN ID used on your switch or other network equipment. Mismatch will result in a lack of connectivity.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the VLAN ID configuration in both the MikroTik and switch.
*   **Incorrect IP Address/Netmask:** Double check IP addresses and netmasks to ensure they are configured correctly. Otherwise, packets won't go to the right place.
    *   **Solution:** Use `/ip address print` to verify the assigned address. Use a subnet calculator to be certain that there are no errors in the network and subnet mask.
*   **IP Forwarding Disabled:** If IP forwarding isn't enabled, the router will not be able to forward traffic between the VLAN and other interfaces.
    *   **Solution:** Verify IP forwarding with `/ip settings print` and set it to `yes` if needed.
*   **No Route to Destination:** If devices behind the VLAN can't connect to the internet (or to other networks), ensure that a default route is configured correctly with the `ip route add` command.
    *   **Solution:** Add a default route for internet access. Example `/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=YOUR_GATEWAY`.
* **Firewall Rules**: Make sure that the firewall rules are not blocking traffic coming from the vlan-25 network. If the firewall is setup to block everything by default, you will have to configure firewall rules to allow traffic from 92.210.3.0/24 to get to your destination.
    * **Solution**: Use the `/ip firewall filter print` to make sure no rules are blocking traffic from this network, or add a rule allowing the desired traffic.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Ping Test:**
    *   **Description:** From a device on the `92.210.3.0/24` network, ping the router's IP address on the `vlan-25` interface (92.210.3.1).
    *   **Action:** From the host on 92.210.3.0/24 run:
        ```bash
        ping 92.210.3.1
        ```
    *   **Expected Outcome:** You should receive a reply from 92.210.3.1, indicating connectivity to the router on this VLAN.

2.  **Traceroute:**
    *   **Description:** Perform a traceroute from a device on the VLAN to an outside address. This checks the forwarding path from a host to an external host.
    *   **Action:** From a host on 92.210.3.0/24 run:
        ```bash
        traceroute 8.8.8.8
        ```
    *   **Expected Outcome:** You should see the first hop as 92.210.3.1 and then subsequent hops on the path to the internet, indicating traffic is being routed.

3.  **MikroTik Torch Tool:**
    *   **Description:** Use the Torch tool on the MikroTik to monitor traffic on the `vlan-25` interface.
    *   **Action:**
        *   In Winbox navigate to `Tools > Torch`.
        *   Select `Interface: vlan-25`.
        *   Click `Start`.
        *   Initiate traffic from a device on the VLAN.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** You should see traffic flowing on the `vlan-25` interface, indicating that the router is forwarding packets on the interface.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server:** Assigning addresses manually to each host is cumbersome. Consider adding a DHCP Server on `vlan-25` to make address assignment easy.
    *   **CLI Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip pool add name=dhcp_pool_vlan25 ranges=92.210.3.100-92.210.3.200
        /ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp_server_vlan25 interface=vlan-25 address-pool=dhcp_pool_vlan25
        /ip dhcp-server network add address=92.210.3.0/24 gateway=92.210.3.1
        ```
*   **Firewall Rules:** Add appropriate firewall rules to secure traffic between VLANs and the internet. If your policy is to block all traffic by default, ensure you create rules to allow traffic from vlan-25 to reach your desired destinations.
*   **Routing Protocols:** For more complex networks, consider using routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, or RIP to manage routing instead of static routes.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to control traffic to and from the `vlan-25` interface. Allow traffic from your 92.210.3.0/24 network to the internet or other destinations. If you block all traffic by default, ensure you add an explicit allow for the desired traffic. Use `chain=forward` and the `src-address` and `dst-address` parameters.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** If your MikroTik is acting only as a router, disable unnecessary services like the `www`, `api`, `telnet`, etc. to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Change default passwords for all accounts, including the admin account. Use strong passwords.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your MikroTik router's RouterOS updated to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Remote Access:** Disable or restrict remote access to your MikroTik unless necessary, and ensure access is secure via a VPN or other strong authentication method. Restrict the number of IPs that can access your router.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides the basics for IP routing within a VLAN.

*   **Improvement:** In the future, we can configure DHCP servers, add firewall rules to secure the traffic to and from the VLAN and configure a default route to access the internet.
*   **Improvement:** More elaborate configurations can be provided, depending on specific needs.
*   **Further modification:** More complex routing scenarios can be included, such as using OSPF, BGP, or other dynamic routing protocols for larger or more complicated networks, and VRF configurations.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

**IP Routing:** At its core, IP routing is the process by which network devices (like routers) forward data packets between different networks. When a device on your network wants to communicate with a device on a different network, the packet is sent to the router. The router examines the destination IP address and uses its routing table (a map of known networks) to determine the next hop – where the packet should be sent next. This process continues until the packet reaches the target network. In the case of this example, we allow the router to forward traffic between the vlan and the default gateway which will typically be the internet.

**VLANs (Virtual LANs):** VLANs are used to segment a network into logical subnetworks. They allow devices to communicate as if they are on the same physical LAN, even though they might not be. This segmentation enhances security, organization, and efficiency. VLANs are implemented using VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q), where a special tag is added to Ethernet frames to identify which VLAN they belong to. In this case, packets on the vlan-25 are tagged with `vlan-id=25`.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:**
    *   **Static Routing (like this setup):** Is simple to configure and doesn't require additional overhead. Good for small networks with predictable paths. However, if a link goes down, the routes are not automatically updated, and manual intervention is required.
    *   **Dynamic Routing:** Use routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP) to automatically discover networks and create routing tables. Useful for complex networks. There is an overhead associated with the routing protocols.
    *   **Trade-off:** For a small network with a single uplink to the internet, static routing is adequate and simple to configure. As a network grows, or gets more complex, dynamic routing may be a better choice.

*   **VLANs vs. No VLANs:**
    *   **No VLANs:** Can be easier for the smallest networks. Devices are all on the same network. As the network grows, collisions will become a problem.
    *   **VLANs:** Enhance security by separating devices into different logical networks, reducing broadcast domains and limiting lateral movement. There is a greater setup effort associated with creating VLANs.
    *   **Trade-off:** For smaller networks, VLANs may seem like extra configuration. However, as the network gets bigger, the increase in security by using VLANs will offset this disadvantage.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is valid for RouterOS versions 6.48, 7.x and 7.11, however:

*   **Prior to RouterOS 7**:
    *   The `/interface vlan` command is the same.
    *   The `/ip address` command is the same.
    *   The `/ip settings set ip-forward=yes` command is the same.
    *   The general concepts are still valid.

*   **RouterOS 7.11 and later:**
    *   The commands remain consistent.
    *   The REST API may have minor differences between RouterOS versions. Please verify the API endpoints to make sure they are correct for your version of RouterOS.
