Please help me!I'm a beginner, a few days ago I accidentally checked the deletion of the default configuration.And when I put it back to default, the mikrotik (mANTBox ax 15s) no longer displays the wifi configuration in 2GHz and 5GHz.I restored a backup (by a .backup configuration that I did), but nothing works.Currently, I can't see the configurations of the Channel, bands, etc. Which in my opinion causes me not to be able to see my wifi network on phone or others.Please help me!In PC, a screenshot in /interface/wifi.Please!Sincerely, GaÃ«tan

```
/system/reset-configuration no-defaults=yes skip-backup=yes
```

I sadly don`t have access to a mANTBox ax 15sSo I can not attempt and reproduce the Issue...Nevertheless, I would do another attempt to RESET the DeviceCode:Select allIf the Issue persist, i would attempt a reinstall via NETInstall
