Sure.That's how it default starts.You only need to look at the IP address, rest of config default starts as a pure switch (because ... that's what it is !).

Yes it can act as a router but the routing throughput is not the same as switching throughput.

Another option is the CRS326 is dual boot, so it can be configured to use SwitchOS.  Makes a great fully managed switch.
