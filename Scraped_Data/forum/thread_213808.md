Hello everyone,I have a Mikrotik router with RouterOS 7.8 . I have a successful PPPoE dialup on eth1 and a DHCP server on eth3.Everything works fine.I would now like any website request, for examplewww.heise.de,www.mikrotik.cometc. to be forwarded to a specific URL.I have already tried a few things with web proxy etc, but as soon as I activate my dst-nat rule with 443, nothing works anymore.How can I now forward any requests or traffic from any device in the DHCP to a specific website / URL?Thank you!BR TW
