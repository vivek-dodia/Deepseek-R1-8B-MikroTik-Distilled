# Analysis Process
Okay, let's tackle this MikroTik RIP troubleshooting scenario. The user wants a detailed scenario focused on OSPF adjacency problems in a SOHO environment using RouterOS 6.x. The subnet is 172.26.255.0/24, and it's a remote site with 72 users affected for 22 hours. 

First, I need to structure the answer according to the given format. Let's start with the initial problem report. The symptoms should include OSPF neighbors not forming, connectivity issues, and possibly routing table discrepancies. Maybe the users can't reach certain networks, leading to downtime.

Next, the environment description and network topology. Since it's a SOHO network, maybe there's a main router and a remote router connected via some link. The Mermaid diagram should show two routers connected, each with their own subnets. The remote site's subnet is given, so perhaps the main site has a different subnet. Let me make sure to label the interfaces correctly.

Initial assessment steps: Check OSPF status, interface configurations, IP addresses, routing tables. Use commands like `/routing ospf neighbor print` to see if neighbors are up. Verify interfaces are running, check IP addresses with `/ip address print`, and look at OSPF configuration with `/routing ospf instance print` and network areas.

For the debugging process, need to include CLI commands. Maybe check OSPF logs with `log print where topics=ospf`. Look for authentication errors, hello intervals mismatched, MTU issues. Verify the network statements in OSPF to ensure the correct interfaces are included. Maybe there's a subnet mask mismatch or an interface not listed in OSPF networks.

Key findings could be an authentication mismatch. Suppose the main router uses MD5 authentication but the remote doesn't. Or maybe the network isn't properly advertised in OSPF. Another possibility is the OSPF timer settings not matching, like hello and dead intervals.

Solution implementation would involve adding authentication to both routers, adjusting timers, or correcting network advertisements. Show before and after configs. For example, before: OSPF instance without authentication. After: adding authentication settings.

Verification steps would involve checking neighbors again, testing connectivity, and confirming routes. Prevention measures could include consistent configurations, documentation, monitoring tools, and regular checks.

Common pitfalls might be forgetting authentication, mismatched timers, or incorrect network statements. Also, ensuring that the OSPF areas are consistent.

I should include example CLI commands in code blocks, maybe some log outputs that show authentication failures. Also, ensure that all RouterOS 6.x commands are compatible since some syntax might differ in later versions.

Wait, the topic is RIP but the scenario is OSPF adjacency problems. That's a conflict. The user might have made a mistake. Let me check the original query again. Oh, the topic is RIP, but the scenario is OSPF adjacency. That's conflicting. Maybe it's a typo. But I need to follow the user's input. The topic says RIP, but the scenario is OSPF. That's confusing. Should I point that out? Well, the user might have intended OSPF, given the scenario. Perhaps they mixed up the terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is RIP but the scenario is OSPF. Hmm. But the user wrote "Topic: RIP" and "Scenario: OSPF Adjacency Problems". That's contradictory. Maybe it's a mistake. But I have to proceed as per the user's instruction. So the topic is RIP but the scenario is OSPF. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the overall topic is RIP, but the specific scenario is OSPF adjacency. That seems odd. Wait, maybe the user intended the topic to be OSPF. Let me check again. The user wrote:

"Create a detailed MikroTik RouterOS troubleshooting scenario for:

Topic: RIP
RouterOS Version: 6.x
Network Scale: SOHO
Subnet: 172.26.255.0/24
Environment: Remote Site
Scenario: OSPF Adjacency Problems
Affected Users: 72
Duration: 22 hours"

So the topic is RIP, but the scenario is OSPF adjacency. That's conflicting. Maybe the user intended the topic to be OSPF, but wrote RIP. Alternatively, the scenario is about RIP but the adjacency problem is with OSPF. That's inconsistent. I need to clarify. But since I can't ask the user, perhaps I should proceed assuming that the scenario is OSPF Adjacency Problems, even though the topic says RIP. Maybe it's a mistake, but the scenario clearly states OSPF. So proceed with OSPF troubleshooting.

Therefore, in the answer, I'll note that there's a discrepancy but proceed with OSPF as per the scenario. Alternatively, if the topic is RIP, then the scenario should involve RIP issues. But the user specified OSPF Adjacency. Hmm. This is a problem. The user might have mixed up the terms. Well, the answer should be as per the user's request. If they want OSPF Adjacency Problems under the topic RIP, that's conflicting. But perhaps the user intended the scenario to be about RIP, but wrote OSPF by mistake. Alternatively, the topic should be OSPF. This is unclear. But given that the scenario is OSPF Adjacency, I'll proceed with OSPF troubleshooting steps, even if the topic says RIP. I'll mention in the answer that there's a possible discrepancy.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a RIP scenario but wrote OSPF. That's possible. But since the scenario is OSPF Adjacency, I'll proceed accordingly. Maybe it's a typo. The answer will focus on OSPF adjacency troubleshooting as per the scenario, even though the topic says RIP. To avoid confusion, perhaps note that in the answer. But the user might have intended OSPF. So proceed with OSPF steps.

# Troubleshooting Guide

# MikroTik RouterOS Troubleshooting Scenario: OSPF Adjacency Problems

## 1. Initial Problem Report and Symptoms
**Reported Issue**:  
Remote SOHO site (172.26.255.0/24) users report intermittent connectivity to HQ resources.  
**Symptoms**:  
- OSPF adjacency between Remote Router (RR) and HQ Router (HQ) fails to establish.  
- 72 users experience packet loss to central services (e.g., file servers).  
- Routing table on RR lacks HQ subnets (e.g., 10.10.0.0/16).  
- Issue persists for 22 hours after initial report.  

---

## 2. Environment Description and Network Topology
**Network Scale**: SOHO (2 routers, 1 subnet)  
**Environment**: Remote site connected via ISP-provided L2 link.  

```mermaid
graph TD
  RR[Remote Router: 172.26.255.1/24] --> ISP_Cloud
  ISP_Cloud --> HQ[HQ Router: 203.0.113.2/30]
  HQ -->|OSPF Area 0| Internal_Network[10.10.0.0/16]
```

---

## 3. Initial Assessment Steps
1. **Verify OSPF neighbor status**:  
   ```bash
   /routing ospf neighbor print
   # Output: No neighbors listed
   ```
2. **Check interface configurations**:  
   ```bash
   /interface print    # Confirm interfaces are UP
   /ip address print   # Verify IP assignments
   ```
3. **Validate OSPF configuration**:  
   ```bash
   /routing ospf instance print
   /routing ospf network print
   ```

---

## 4. Detailed Debugging Process
### Step 1: Enable OSPF Debugging
```bash
/log print where topics=ospf
# Sample log output:
# "OSPF: Hello packet from 203.0.113.2: authentication mismatch"
```

### Step 2: Verify OSPF Authentication
```bash
# Check HQ Router (example):
/routing ospf instance set default authentication=md5 authentication-key=secret123
# Check Remote Router:
/routing ospf instance print
# Output: authentication=none
```

### Step 3: Compare OSPF Timers
```bash
# On Remote Router:
/routing ospf interface print
# Output: hello-interval=10, dead-interval=40

# On HQ Router (via SSH):
/routing ospf interface print
# Output: hello-interval=5, dead-interval=20  # Mismatch!
```

---

## 5. Key Findings and Root Cause Analysis
**Root Cause**:  
- **Authentication Mismatch**: Remote Router used `authentication=none`, while HQ Router used MD5.  
- **Timer Mismatch**: Hello/dead intervals differed (RR: 10/40 vs. HQ: 5/20).  

**Impact**:  
- OSPF adjacency failed due to authentication and timer incompatibility.  
- Remote site routes were not propagated to HQ.  

---

## 6. Solution Implementation Steps
### Before Configuration (Remote Router):
```bash
/routing ospf instance print
# authentication=none, hello-interval=10, dead-interval=40
```

### After Configuration:
```bash
/routing ospf instance set default authentication=md5 authentication-key=secret123
/routing ospf interface set [find interface=ether1] hello-interval=5 dead-interval=20
```

---

## 7. Verification Process
1. Confirm OSPF adjacency:  
   ```bash
   /routing ospf neighbor print
   # Output: state="Full" address=203.0.113.2
   ```
2. Validate routing table:  
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=ospf
   # Output: 10.10.0.0/16 via 203.0.113.2
   ```

---

## 8. Prevention Measures
- Standardize OSPF authentication and timers across all routers.  
- Use configuration templates for SOHO deployments.  
- Implement monitoring (e.g., `Toolbox` or `The Dude`) for OSPF status alerts.

## 9. Related Commands Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/routing ospf neighbor print` | List OSPF neighbors |
| `/log print where topics=ospf` | Filter OSPF logs |
| `/routing ospf interface set [find] hello-interval=5` | Adjust timers |

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Mismatched authentication types** (e.g., MD5 vs. None).  
- **Inconsistent OSPF areas** (e.g., Area 0 vs. Area 1).  
- **Firewall rules blocking OSPF multicast (224.0.0.5)**.  
- **MTU mismatches** on WAN interfaces.
