I just upgraded to Winbox 4 and (beta 16), routeros 7.17 and I have a multiline system note that uses whitespace to format some large ACII text.In Winbox 3, this displayed correctly using the same font as the terminal does when the system note is displayed on the GUI.In Winbox 4, the whitespace is not displayed consistently, and space characters are compressed at login on the GUI. The terminal still shows it correctly.Looks like the wrong font was used to display the system notes at Winbox login. Is there any way to get it to use a proper terminal font like it did in earlier versions?

Why do not post this on dedicated winbox 4 topic instead of uselessly open another topic?

Same here, v4 still needs some more work before itâ€™s usable.
