I didn't try ... but how about /interface/wifi/access-list on CAPsMAN device?Thanks, you pointed me in the right direction. The problem then was that my 2.4GHz interfaces, both local and remote, are created dynamically and there is no way for the access list entries to be relevant to, say, all interfaces whose name matches a regex pattern. So I had to come up with an interface list populated automatically via a datapath. The whole experience has been as frustrating and painful as it gets, truly a horrible user journey.Thanks again for your help!
