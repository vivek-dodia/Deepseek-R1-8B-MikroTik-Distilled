# MikroTik RouterOS Advanced Configuration: Subnet 35.205.220.0/24 on bridge-31

This document provides an in-depth guide to configuring a MikroTik router with the subnet 35.205.220.0/24 on a bridge interface named `bridge-31`, targeting RouterOS 7.11 (or 6.48/7.x). We will cover advanced IP addressing, routing, and related features with detailed explanations, security best practices, and troubleshooting. This configuration is designed for an Enterprise-scale network environment.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario

**Scenario:**

We are configuring an enterprise router that connects multiple internal networks. We need to create a bridge interface `bridge-31`, assign the subnet 35.205.220.0/24 to it, and configure basic routing and DHCP services for devices connected to this bridge. We will also cover IPv6 configuration and related features.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS version 7.11 (or 6.48/7.x)
*   A physical or virtual MikroTik router.
*   Available interfaces to add to the bridge.
*   Understanding of basic networking concepts.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

### 2.1. Using CLI

*   **Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge
    add name=bridge-31
    ```
    This command creates a bridge interface named `bridge-31`.

*   **Step 2: Add Interfaces to the Bridge**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=bridge-31 interface=ether2
    add bridge=bridge-31 interface=ether3
    ```
    Replace `ether2` and `ether3` with the actual interfaces you wish to include in the bridge. You can add more interfaces if needed.

*   **Step 3: Assign an IP Address to the Bridge Interface**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=35.205.220.1/24 interface=bridge-31
    ```
    This command assigns the IP address `35.205.220.1/24` to the `bridge-31` interface.

*   **Step 4: Configure DHCP Server**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool_31 ranges=35.205.220.100-35.205.220.200
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=dhcp_pool_31 interface=bridge-31 name=dhcp_srv_31
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=35.205.220.0/24 gateway=35.205.220.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```
    These commands configure a DHCP server for the bridge with IP addresses from 35.205.220.100 to 35.205.220.200.

*   **Step 5: Basic Firewall Rule (Optional, but highly recommended)**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add action=accept chain=input connection-state=established,related
    add action=drop chain=input in-interface=bridge-31
    add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
    add action=drop chain=forward
    ```
    This firewall rule accepts established connections and drops new, unwanted connections. Adapt as per your specific security needs.

### 2.2 Using Winbox GUI

*   **Step 1: Navigate to Interface > Bridge**
    *   Click on the "+" icon to add a new bridge.
    *   Enter `bridge-31` as the name and click "Apply."

*   **Step 2: Add Ports to the Bridge**
    *   Navigate to the "Ports" tab within the bridge configuration window.
    *   Click the "+" icon to add each interface to the bridge (e.g., `ether2`, `ether3`).

*   **Step 3: Configure IP Address**
    *   Go to IP > Addresses.
    *   Click the "+" icon.
    *   Enter `35.205.220.1/24` in the "Address" field and select `bridge-31` for the interface.

*   **Step 4: Configure DHCP Server**
    *   Go to IP > Pool
    *   Click the "+" icon to add an IP pool for DHCP. Name it `dhcp_pool_31` and configure ranges as mentioned previously (e.g., `35.205.220.100-35.205.220.200`).
    *   Go to IP > DHCP Server.
    *   Click the "+" icon, name it `dhcp_srv_31`, select interface as `bridge-31` , and set the address pool to `dhcp_pool_31`.
    *    Go to IP > DHCP Server > Networks
    *   Click the "+" icon. set address to `35.205.220.0/24`, gateway to `35.205.220.1` and DNS servers to `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`.

*  **Step 5: Basic Firewall Rule**
   * Go to IP > Firewall
   * Select filter tab and create rules as mentioned before.

    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface bridge print detail` to examine bridge port membership and ensure no conflicts.

*   **Pitfall 2: Firewall Blocking DHCP:**  If no DHCP addresses are assigned, check if your firewall rules are blocking DHCP traffic (UDP ports 67 and 68).
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Examine firewall rules using `/ip firewall filter print` and temporarily disable filter rules to identify the cause.

*   **Pitfall 3: Incorrect IP Address Configuration:** Overlapping subnets or incorrect subnet masks will cause routing conflicts.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip address print` to check for address conflicts.

*   **Pitfall 4: Interface Issues:** If you've added an interface to the bridge but are experiencing connectivity issues ensure the interface is enabled and connected with appropriate cabling.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface print` to check the interfaces and the `monitor-traffic` command to analyze traffic flow.

*   **Diagnostic Tools:**
    *   **Ping:** `/ping 35.205.220.x` (replace 'x' with an IP address on the network) to test connectivity.
    *   **Traceroute:** `/traceroute 35.205.220.x` to check routing path.
    *   **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=bridge-31` to monitor real-time traffic.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** A bridge operates at Layer 2, forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses. It creates a single broadcast domain. MikroTik bridges can have multiple physical or virtual ports, acting as a single switch.

*   **Routing:** Routing occurs at Layer 3, forwarding traffic based on IP addresses. Routers select the best path for traffic delivery, using routing tables. MikroTik supports static, dynamic, and policy based routing.

*   **Firewall:** MikroTik firewalls use filter rules to control packet flow, based on source/destination IP, protocol, port, and state. They protect networks from malicious traffic.

*   **DHCP Server:** Assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices on the network. MikroTik DHCP servers provide IP addresses, DNS server information, and default gateways to clients.

*   **VLANs:** Virtual networks that allow isolation of devices at the layer two level.

*   **VXLAN:** Virtual extensible LAN used to overcome the scalability limitations of VLANs.

*   **Connection Tracking:**  Tracks ongoing network connections, allowing stateful firewall rules. MikroTik connection tracking is efficient and flexible.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for router access. Change the default passwords.
*   **API Security:** Secure the API using proper authentication and restrict API access to trusted sources.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules. Block all incoming traffic by default, then allow required services. Filter both input and forward chains.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable unused services to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS and firmware updated.
*   **Disable Neighbor Discovery:** If you're not using Neighbor Discovery, disable it, especially on public-facing interfaces to prevent potential information leakage.
*   **Limit WinBox Access:** Restrict WinBox access to specific IP addresses.
*  **IP Services:** Only enable services as required.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for the required MikroTik Topics

This documentation contains in depth explanations and examples of each topic specified in the request, refer to **6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**, and the other sections for related topics.

## 11. Trade-offs Between Configurations

*   **Bridging vs. Routing:** Bridging is simple, creates a single broadcast domain, and doesn't offer routing functionality. Routing is more complex but provides more granular control, network segmentation, and path selection. Choose bridging for simple networks, routing for complex setups.

*   **Hardware vs Software Bridge:** Hardware bridging is faster, but has less flexibility than software bridging.

*   **Static vs Dynamic Routing:** Static routes are simple but require manual configuration. Dynamic routing is scalable but needs additional configurations and adds more complexity. Static for small networks, dynamic for larger and complex setups.

*   **Simple Queues vs HTB:** Simple Queues are easier but less flexible. HTB offers advanced traffic shaping with more flexibility for more complex scenarios.

*   **Stateful vs Stateless Firewall:** Stateful firewalls provide more protection, but increase processing overhead, while stateless firewalls have less overhead but may have limited protection. Statefull firewalls offer better security but require more processing overhead.

*   **Different Routing protocols:** Each routing protocol has different advantages and disadvantages in terms of convergence, performance, scalability and security, and should be picked based on the use-case.
