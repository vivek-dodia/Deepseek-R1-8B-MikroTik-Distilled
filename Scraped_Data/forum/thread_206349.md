```
:globalipaddress[/queue simpleget1target];:globaltest[:globalipaddress;:find $ipaddress"/"];
```

Code:Select allInside the function, ipaddress is not known so you have refer to it by :global ipaddress.

```
:globalipaddresses[/queue simpleget[find name=queue1]target]:globalipaddress[:pick $ipaddresses0]:globalcidrmark[:find  $ipaddress"/"]:put"$[:pick $ipaddress 0 $cidrmark]"
```

```
{:localipaddress([/queue simpleget[find name=queue1]target]->0);:put"$[:pick $ipaddress 0 [:find  $ipaddress /]]"}
```

Couple other things too:- The first line use "get 1", however that's not an *id so it depends on print being called to establish the index of 1.  Using "get ([find]->0)" or "get [find name=queue1]" instead avoid needing.- There can be multiple "target" from "/queue simple get", and :find does not work with arrays & so need use get the 1st element listed as "target" firstFor example,Code:Select allAlthough these could be a locals and combined:Code:Select all

Hi,Thank you for your answersCode:Select allInside the function, ipaddress is not known so you have refer to it by :global ipaddress.With this solution, I have a result : "$ipaddress"Couple other things too:- The first line use "get 1", however that's not an *id so it depends on print being called to establish the index of 1.  Using "get ([find]->0)" or "get [find name=queue1]" instead avoid needing.- There can be multiple "target" from "/queue simple get", and :find does not work with arrays & so need use get the 1st element listed as "target" firstFor example,Code:Select allAlthough these could be a locals and combined:Code:Select all- The first line use "get 1", however that's not an *id so it depends on print being called to establish the index of 1.  Using "get ([find]->0)" or "get [find name=queue1]" instead avoid needing.It was for the example, I understood that the get 1 corresponded to the number present in this menu on Winbox- There can be multiple "target" from "/queue simple get", and :find does not work with arrays & so need use get the 1st element listed as "target" firstIndeed, you have found my problem, I had not seen this return as an array but a character string !thanks a lot for your helpGood evening to youXavier
