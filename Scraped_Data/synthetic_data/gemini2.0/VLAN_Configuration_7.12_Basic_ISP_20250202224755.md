**VLAN Configuration in RouterOS 7.12 for ISPs**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

* Configure VLANs for customer isolation and traffic segregation within an ISP's network.
* Provide separate VLANs for different customer services (e.g., internet, VoIP, IPTV).

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**1. Create VLAN Interfaces**

Create VLAN interfaces for each required VLAN. For example, for VLAN 100:

```
/interface vlan add name=vlan100 vlan-id=100
```

**2. Assign VLANs to Ports**

Assign VLANs to specific switch ports to create VLAN-aware segments. For example, assign VLAN 100 to port 1:

```
/interface ethernet switch port set ether1-1 vlan=vlan100
```

**3. Configure Routing Between VLANs**

Enable layer-3 routing on the VLAN interfaces and create static routes to connect different VLANs. For example, to allow traffic from VLAN 100 to VLAN 200:

```
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.100.0/24 gateway=192.168.200.1
```

**4. Configure DHCP Server on VLANs (Optional)**

Configure DHCP servers on the VLAN interfaces to automatically assign IP addresses to devices connected to those VLANs. For example, for VLAN 100:

```
/ip dhcp-server add interface=vlan100 address-pool=pool1
```

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/interface vlan add name=vlan100 vlan-id=100
/interface ethernet switch port set ether1-1 vlan=vlan100
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.100.0/24 gateway=192.168.200.1
/ip dhcp-server add interface=vlan100 address-pool=pool1
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

* Ensure that the switch ports are configured in switch mode, not routed mode.
* Check that the VLAN ID is valid (1-4094).
* Verify that the routing table has appropriate static routes to connect different VLANs.
* Ensure that the DHCP server address pool has a sufficient range of IP addresses.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

* Ping between devices on different VLANs to verify connectivity.
* Check the MAC address table to confirm that devices are assigned to the correct VLANs.
* Use the DHCP client on devices to obtain IP addresses.

**Related Features and Considerations**

* **Bridge VLANs:** Create a bridge interface and add VLAN interfaces as members to extend VLANs across multiple switches.
* **Layer-2 Isolation:** Enable MAC address learning only within each VLAN to prevent unauthorized traffic from crossing VLAN boundaries.
* **VLAN Filtering:** Configure firewall rules to restrict traffic between specific VLANs or MAC addresses.

**MikroTik REST API Examples**

**Endpoint:** `/interface/vlan`

**Request Method:** GET

**JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "interface": "vlan100"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
[
  {
    ".id": "1",
    "name": "vlan100",
    "vlan-id": 100,
    "interface": "vlan100"
  }
]
```

**Notes:**

* Refer to the official RouterOS documentation for more advanced configuration options.
* Double-check VLAN configurations to ensure the intended level of isolation and security.
