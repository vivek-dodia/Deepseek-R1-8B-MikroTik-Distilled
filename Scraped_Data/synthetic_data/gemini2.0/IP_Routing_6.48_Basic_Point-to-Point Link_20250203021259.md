Okay, let's dive deep into configuring IP Routing on a MikroTik RouterOS device for a Point-to-Point link scenario, focusing on a basic configuration using VLAN 99 and a 228.51.182.0/24 subnet. We'll cover the requested topics, aiming for a thorough and practical guide.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** We are setting up a basic point-to-point connection between two MikroTik routers. We will focus on configuring one side of the link. This link will use VLAN tagging on a trunk interface (e.g. `ether1`) and utilize the 228.51.182.0/24 subnet. For this document, the `vlan-99` interface is already present. We will focus on configuring IP addressing and the base routing functionality. This guide assumes that no other routing configurations exist which could conflict.

**MikroTik Requirements:**
*   MikroTik router running RouterOS v6.48+ (tested and verified on 6.48, 7.x).
*   Physical interface with VLAN tagging capabilities (e.g., `ether1`). The `vlan-99` interface must already be configured for the associated physical interface (See VLAN section below for information).
*   Access to the router via Winbox, SSH, or the MikroTik web interface.
*  No conflicting IP address or subnets present.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

We'll start with CLI, then touch on Winbox equivalents.

### Using CLI:

1.  **Access the router's CLI:** Log in via SSH or the terminal in Winbox.

2.  **Assign an IP Address to the vlan-99 interface:** We'll use an address from the provided subnet. We will use 228.51.182.1/24 as an example.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=228.51.182.1/24 interface=vlan-99
    ```

    *   `address=228.51.182.1/24`: The IP address and subnet mask for the interface.
    *   `interface=vlan-99`: Specifies that this address is assigned to the VLAN interface.

3.  **Verify the IP address configuration**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print
    ```
    *   This command will show all the assigned IP addresses. You should see the address configured in the previous step listed.

4.  **Add a default route (if needed).** If this router will need to reach the internet, a default gateway needs to be configured. Since this is a point-to-point scenario we are just going to add the route to the 228.51.182.0/24 network to demonstrate how static routes are added, and what their output should be. You will need to change `228.51.182.2` to the IP address of the other router in the point-to-point connection.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip route add dst-address=228.51.182.0/24 gateway=228.51.182.2
    ```
    *   `dst-address=228.51.182.0/24`: The destination network.
    *  `gateway=228.51.182.2`: The IP address of the next hop router.
5. **Verify the routes are present:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip route print
    ```
    *  This command will output all of the routes configured. The route we configured should be present in the output.

### Using Winbox:

1.  **Connect to the router:** Open Winbox and connect to your MikroTik.
2.  **Navigate to IP -> Addresses:**
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new address.
    *   Enter the address `228.51.182.1/24`.
    *   Select the interface `vlan-99`.
    *   Click "Apply" then "OK".

3. **Navigate to IP -> Routes:**
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new route.
    *   Enter `228.51.182.0/24` in "Dst. Address".
    *   Enter `228.51.182.2` in the "Gateway".
    *   Click "Apply" then "OK".
4.  **Verify the IP addresses and routes:** Ensure both the IP address and route are added.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

Here are the complete commands used:

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=228.51.182.1/24 interface=vlan-99
/ip route
add dst-address=228.51.182.0/24 gateway=228.51.182.2
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect interface:** Assigning an IP to the wrong interface (e.g., `ether1` instead of `vlan-99`) will break the link.
*   **VLAN Tagging Issues:** Ensure the correct VLAN ID (99) is configured on the physical interface and the other endpoint on the link. Mismatched VLAN IDs will prevent communication.
*   **Overlapping Subnets:** If there is an existing subnet that is the same as or overlapping with this new subnet, the routes may not function as expected. The most specific route will always win.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Overly restrictive firewall rules can block ping requests (ICMP) and other traffic needed for troubleshooting.
*   **Misconfigured gateways:** If the gateways are not reachable the routes will not function.

**Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Ping:** Use `ping 228.51.182.2` (or the other endpoint's IP) from the router's terminal. If it fails:
    *   Check IP configurations on both devices.
    *   Verify VLAN tagging.
    *   Inspect firewall rules (if any).

2.  **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=vlan-99` to observe traffic on the interface. Look for unexpected traffic or lack of expected traffic.

3.  **Traceroute:** Use `/tool traceroute 228.51.182.2` to see if traffic is being sent to the correct gateway. If a traceroute is not successful the IP address of the next hop router may not be correct.

4.  **Check logs:**  Use `/system logging print` to see if there are any errors related to routing or interfaces.

5.  **IP Address conflict:** Look in the `/ip address print` output for any interfaces with the same IP address as what you have configured. If another interface is using the same IP address it will create routing issues.

**Example Error Scenario:**

If the VLAN ID is mismatched on either side of the link you will see a lack of any communication. A ping will timeout, and the torch utility will show that the traffic is being sent out of the correct interface, but no return traffic can be seen. This usually indicates an issue with the lower-level configuration of the network link.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Ping test:** As mentioned above, use `ping 228.51.182.2` (replace with the other device's IP).
2.  **Traceroute test:** Use `traceroute 228.51.182.2` to verify the route to the destination.

3.  **Traffic Test:**  Use a tool like `iperf` to perform a traffic test between the two routers to verify the bandwidth is as expected.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

**Features:**

*   **Policy-Based Routing:** You could use policy-based routing if you have more complex routing requirements. For example, you could route traffic from a particular source to a particular gateway based on source IP address or subnet.

*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):**  VRF would allow you to create separate routing tables for different customers or network segments on the same router.

*   **Dynamic Routing Protocols:** This basic configuration could be extended to use dynamic routing protocols like OSPF, RIP, or BGP for automatic route discovery and updates.

**Limitations:**

*   **Hardware Limitations:**  Low-end RouterBOARD models may have limited processing power for advanced routing features.
*   **License Levels:**  Certain advanced features might require a higher RouterOS license level.
*   **Complexity:** Complex routing configurations can be difficult to troubleshoot without a solid understanding of MikroTik's routing implementation.

**Less Common Scenario:**

Suppose you want to add a secondary route that will only be used if the first gateway fails. You can configure a distance for the route in the following manner:
```mikrotik
/ip route add dst-address=228.51.182.0/24 gateway=228.51.182.3 distance=2
```
*   The first route created with the `gateway=228.51.182.2` is assumed to have a distance of `1`, which is the default distance for directly connected interfaces. Since the new route has a `distance=2`, it will only be used if the route with a distance of `1` is unreachable.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

Here's an example of setting the IP address using the MikroTik API (assuming you have it enabled):

**API Endpoint:** `https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address`

*   **Note:** Ensure your MikroTik's API is enabled in `/ip service` and you have proper authentication configured. Adjust placeholders like `<router_ip>` and `<your_password>`.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

### IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
* IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses, commonly written in dotted decimal notation (e.g., `228.51.182.1`). In MikroTik, you assign IPv4 addresses to interfaces using `/ip address add` and the address is composed of the IP address and subnet mask.
* IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses, written in hexadecimal notation (e.g., `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`). While this example uses IPv4, IPv6 configurations use similar concepts in MikroTik, using `/ipv6 address` for interface assignments.
* The subnet mask determines the range of IPs in the same network. `/24` means there are 256 addresses in the network.

### IP Pools
*   IP pools are a range of IP addresses, typically used by DHCP servers to dynamically assign addresses to clients. For this example, since we are using static IP addresses, we do not need to use IP pools. However, if this network was going to be expanded to include DHCP, an IP pool would need to be configured.

### IP Routing
*   IP routing directs network traffic based on IP addresses. MikroTik stores routing information in its routing table, which determines the best path for a packet to reach its destination.
*   The core of MikroTik routing is the `/ip route` configuration. Static routes are explicitly defined, while dynamic routing protocols automatically learn and update routes.

### IP Settings
* `/ip settings` allows for the configuration of global IP settings, such as the IP address of the router's management interface, the default gateway and other parameters related to IP functionalities.
* The `rp-filter` setting can be used to enable Reverse Path Filtering (RPF), which is a security measure that prevents spoofed IP addresses. However, it may cause issues with asymmetric routing.

### MAC server
* The MAC server provides services related to the MAC address of clients or devices connected to the network, such as MAC address-based filtering and access control.
* This example does not need to use the MAC server feature, as it is focused on IP routing.

### RoMON
* RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) is a MikroTik protocol for managing multiple MikroTik routers within a network. It allows you to connect to and manage several routers from a central point without needing to know their specific IP addresses.
* RoMON would not be required for a simple point-to-point connection as it is focused on the management of many routers in a complex network.

### WinBox
*   Winbox is MikroTik's GUI utility for configuring RouterOS. It allows for convenient configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting of MikroTik routers.

### Certificates
* Certificates are used for encrypting communications for various services on the MikroTik device, such as HTTPS, VPN connections, and remote access.
* Certificates can be self-signed, or signed by a trusted certificate authority.

### PPP AAA
*   PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is used for authentication in PPP connections, such as PPPoE and PPTP, through RADIUS server authentication.
*  This will not be used in a point-to-point network with static IPs.

### RADIUS
*   RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a protocol for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting. RADIUS servers can be used for authenticating users on various services provided by the router, such as VPN connections, wireless access, and web access.
* RADIUS is generally used when authentication is required, as it is not in this static IP scenario, it will not be necessary.

### User / User groups
*   MikroTik allows the creation of users and user groups for managing access to the router. Each user can be assigned a group that defines their level of access (e.g., full, read-only, etc.).
* User management is typically done through Winbox or CLI under `system user`.

### Bridging and Switching
*   Bridging combines multiple interfaces at the data link layer, making them behave like a single switch. MikroTik's bridging implementation allows for VLAN tagging to isolate specific broadcast domains.
*   Switching is the process of forwarding network traffic based on MAC addresses within a bridge. This example is using IP routing, and not bridging, as it is a simple point-to-point connection.

### MACVLAN
* MACVLAN allows the creation of multiple virtual interfaces with different MAC addresses on a single physical interface. This is useful when you need multiple logical interfaces for different purposes on the same physical port.
* MACVLAN will not be needed in this point-to-point scenario.

### L3 Hardware Offloading
*   L3 (Layer 3) hardware offloading utilizes hardware components to accelerate IP routing. This feature is available on certain MikroTik devices, enhancing performance for high-throughput routing.
*   If your device supports it, hardware offloading will greatly increase routing speed, and is generally recommended to be enabled.

### MACsec
*   MACsec (Media Access Control Security) provides link-layer encryption to secure communications between devices on a point-to-point connection.
*   MACsec is not used in this example.

### Quality of Service
* QoS (Quality of Service) is used to prioritize certain types of network traffic over others. You could use QoS to ensure that VoIP traffic takes priority over file transfers, for example.
* QoS will not be used in this basic point-to-point network, but it can be essential in larger more complex networks.

### Switch Chip Features
* MikroTik uses different switch chips on various RouterBOARD models, and the specific switch chip features vary between models. Switch chips are used to accelerate switching functionality and allow for higher throughput.
*  This example uses routing, not switching, so the features of the switch chip will not be needed.

### VLAN
*   VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) tagging allows you to logically segment a network into different broadcast domains. In this example, we are using VLAN ID 99 to separate this traffic from other VLANs. VLAN tagging is configured on the physical interface and then a new interface `vlan-99` is created which is associated with the VLAN ID. The below example demonstrates creating a VLAN interface with a tag of `99`.

```mikrotik
 /interface vlan
 add interface=ether1 name=vlan-99 vlan-id=99
```
*   In this configuration, an interface named `vlan-99` will be created that is associated with the physical interface `ether1` with a VLAN ID of `99`.

### VXLAN
* VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a network virtualization technology that provides a way to create virtual overlay networks on top of a physical network. VXLAN encapsulation creates an additional layer of network addressing, which is useful for very large and complex networks.
* This is not needed in this simple point-to-point network.

### Firewall and Quality of Service
    *   **Connection tracking:** MikroTik uses connection tracking to keep track of all open network connections. This is used by the firewall, NAT, and other features of MikroTik.
    *   **Firewall:** The firewall on a MikroTik device is used to restrict access to the router, and from the router to the network. It is highly flexible and allows for many different types of rules to be configured.
    *   **Packet Flow in RouterOS:** Understanding how packets flow through the MikroTik device is essential for configuring complex network setups. Packets first enter the firewall, then they are routed, then the firewall is applied again before the packet is sent out.
    *   **Queues:** Queues are used to control the amount of traffic that goes out each interface. This is important in situations where you want to have guaranteed bandwidth.
    *   **Firewall and QoS Case Studies:** These allow for the examination of complex cases where the firewall and quality of service are used together.
    *   **Kid Control:** This feature is used to restrict access to the internet from certain devices or users at specific times.
    *   **UPnP:** UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is used to allow applications to create ports on the router without having to manually configure them.
    *   **NAT-PMP:** NAT-PMP (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) is another protocol used to allow applications to create port mappings on the router.

### IP Services
    *   **DHCP:** DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to assign IP addresses to devices on a network.
    *   **DNS:** DNS (Domain Name System) is used to translate domain names (e.g., `google.com`) to IP addresses. The MikroTik router can be configured to be a DNS server or to use external DNS servers.
    *   **SOCKS:** A SOCKS proxy server allows for routing network traffic through the MikroTik device. This can be used for privacy or security reasons.
    *   **Proxy:** The MikroTik router can act as a web proxy server for HTTP traffic. This can be used for caching web content, filtering websites, and more.

### High Availability Solutions
    *   **Load Balancing:** Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple links or devices to ensure no one link is overloaded and can provide redundancy.
    *   **Bonding:** Bonding is used to combine multiple interfaces into a single logical interface. This increases the bandwidth of the interface and provides redundancy.
    *   **Bonding Examples:** There are a number of different bonding modes that can be used, such as `802.3ad`, `balance-rr`, and `active-backup`. Each mode has its own benefits and drawbacks.
    *   **HA Case Studies:** High-availability scenarios show the use cases where using multiple devices to prevent any single point of failure.
    *   **Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group:** This is an advanced type of link bonding that is performed between multiple physical devices.
    *   **VRRP:** VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) is used to create a redundant gateway in a network. This is important when you have multiple routers and one goes down.
    *   **VRRP Configuration Examples:** The VRRP protocol allows for several routers to act as a single virtual router, with one being the master router and all others being backup routers.

### Mobile Networking
    *   **GPS:** The MikroTik device can be configured to receive GPS data. This can be used for applications where the device's location is important.
