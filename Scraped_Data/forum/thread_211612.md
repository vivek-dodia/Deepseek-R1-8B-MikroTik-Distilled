Hi All,Just looking for a santiy check here before I go back to EE!I have a LtAP Mini (the new 2024 version) with an external antenna.EE as the network obviously.RSSI -77 dBmRSRP -92dBmSINR 2dBRSRW -13dBScreenshot 2024-10-09 131002.pngI've configured the APN for EE as "everywhere" with "eesecure" and "secure" as the username/password. Doesn't seem to matter if I use PAP or CHAP.Screenshot 2024-10-09 131033.pngI keep getting an internet IP of 254.128.0.0 and can't ping 8.8.8.8 for example on the lte1 interface.LTE interface is configured for bands 3 and 20. (I have tried specifying no bands, and it picks up Band1 (-86,-100,3,-13 respectively on that band)Screenshot 2024-10-09 131148.pngCell monitor sees plenty of Cell ID's on Band 3.Screenshot 2024-10-09 131336.pngSeems like things are up, but not getting an IP. Can anyone suggest some troubleshooting please?

If you put an APN manually, It Is ignored if the "use network APN" is ticked.Not to be overly critic of the good Mikrotik guys, but I think that GUI designer apprentices learn on the first or maybe second day that when a check box disables a field, the field must be grayed out and made not editabile.Still ...

Ok, this doesn't seem to have affected anything sadly. Still getting that 254.128.0.0 IP.Put a known working SIM in also, and it registers OK, but doesn't seem to change no matter if I try CHAP or PAP or leave the Use Network APN enabled or not!

Cracked it - had the IP set to "Auto" not "IPv4".FFS!!!

```
Code:Select all[admin@MikroTik]>/interface/lte/apn/printdetailFlags:*-default0*name="default"apn="data.uk"use-peer-dns=nouse-network-apn=noadd-default-route=yesdefault-route-distance=2ip-type=autoauthentication=none
```

With 1pMobile (an MVNO on EE), the following works:It might be that they run their own PGW and so the allocation process is different, but I get an EE IP address (not locally, it's a CGNAT NAT44 external address) so I'm tending to think they don't.
