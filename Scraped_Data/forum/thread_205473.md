Hello there!I recently got a single cAP ax for my homelab and am currently evaluating CAPsMAN for our office network. I got CAPsMAN setup with 3 cAP ax and everything is running smoothly so far. However, when it comes to steering neighbour groups with CAPsMAN, I am unsure if this is exptected behaviour or a possible bug. The documentation states that without explicitly configuring a steering neighbour group, a dynamic group is created with all APs with the same SSID. While this is true for my single AP setup at home, the office setup shows no neighbour group at all unless I explicitly configure it. Is this expected behaviour?

Default following parameters are set in steering:neighbour-group based on SSIDrrm = yeswnm = yesIt's not because you do not see it that it is not working.That's the whole point of default values.Put it otherwise, how do you know it is not working ?Tip:open terminal and use /interface/wifi/steering/neighbor-group/printI think you will see something there. A dynamic entry.

Hi holvoetn,that's exactly what I did. With the single AP setup at home, I can see the dynamic group when executing '/interface/wifi/steering/neighbor-group/print'. With the CAPsMAN setup, the list is empty unless I configure a neighbor-group explictly.My (sanitized) config looks like this:With 'steering.neighbor-group=ng1' a group is created and I can see all MAC addresses that are part of this group. Without this setting, no dynamic group is created.

Silly question: the commandwhich returns an empty list is issued on the capsman device?

Yes, in which case it is 'ap001'

If you use capsman, you should check this on capsman controller.Don't set anything manual on AP since it will overwrite capsman settings.


---
### Author: Tue Mar 12, 2024 3:12 pm

All configuration is done on the CAPsMAN controller and, like I said, did issue the command on the controller as well. Basically all I did on the CAPs was setting it into caps-mode and changed the password.

### Author: Tue Mar 12, 2024 3:34 pm

Thus, am I right if I say that one of the cAP ax is the capsman controller (ap001) and the other twos are CAPs? (Sorry, I imagined that there was a 4th device involved.)Another probably silly question: how are the wifi interfaces configured on ap001? Using capsman or by directly applying the configurations to the interfaces?Moreover, do you mind to share your exported configuration?

No problem, I could have been more specific with the general setup in the first place. Just to make this clear, you are correct: 'ap001' is the CAPsMAN controller, the other two cAP ax's are configured as CAPs, no other MT components involved. Configuration profiles of 'ap001' are configured directly on the interfaces.Here's a config export:

If you go in Wifi / Steering, the button on the top with neighbor groups, doesn't it show a dynamic group ?I have nothing configured in steering nor configuration and all radios with the same SSID nicely come together in one single dynamic steering group.

I don't have any specific suspect, as your configuration seems similar to mine (with 2 APs instead of 3) and I do have the expected dynamic neighbor groups.One possible (unrelated) error is the configuration of the dhcp client (which you probably have to remove)Some random pointers to check (probably unrelated, just the main differences with my config):You are using EAP, while I am using PSK. Can you try to change to WPA2-PSK?The SSID has a - Can you try to remove? (Maybe there is some bug...)I cannot understand your topology (how are the other APs connected? Via a switch?) and how you configured the VLANs/datapaths

What exactly do you mean with configuration error of the DHCP client?The topology is as follows:all APs are managed within the same VLAN, which is the native VLAN configured on the switch portsall APs are getting a static DHCP leaseVLAN IDs for wireless clients are dynamically assigned by RADIUS attributes

I apologize if I was not clear. Your configuration includeswhile ether1 is part of the bridge. And I don't see how your APs (at least ap001) get their lease.I am not experienced enough to assess if your VLAN config is correct. I am expecting something different (for example, vlan-ids set in datapath, since you are using ax devices), but I cannot conclude that there are errors in the config. I apologize if my observation added noise to the discussion.Apart from my previous list (quite vague), I am out of ideas.

Aaand you got 100 points! As soon as I configured WPA-PSK as authentication mechanism, a dynamic neighbor-group is created. Thank you for helping me to pinpoint the problem! The next question is: What now? Is this something where I can open a support ticket at MT?

> That being said, regarding the original query. Feedback from developers currently is as follows:Dynamic neighbor groups are automatically created while using PSK, if the same SSID and PSK are used, these attributes tell us that interfaces have the same connection requirements, since we have this information, RouterOS can create a dynamic group for this scenario, for these specific interfaces.In the case of EAP, currently, it's not possible to create automatic neighbor groups, since there are no comparable attributes that would guarantee that the connection requirements are the same in all cases. Which, unfortunately, means that the network administrator needs to specify that interfaces are part of the same group.We might investigate in the future, if we can find some workaround that would allow dynamic neighbor steering groups for EAP, but currently, I can't give any guarantees regarding that.

True, can't comment anything when there's nothing new to share...It only affects profiles with EAP authentication.MT support finally responded and confirmed that no steering group is automatically created if EAP is used as a authentication mechanism:I asked them to add some information to the documentation, which they did right away:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... properties

Which is great they added the line to the documentation. That's what brought me here. What they forgot to add is HOW do you add a neighbor group manually? I've been looking for a way to do this, but there isn't an ADD button and the CLI doesn't have an ADD command under neighbor-groups.

You make a neighbour group in steering. Two locations (and from the GUI there is a tab steering:/interface/wifi/configuration/steering/interface/wifi/steering

No, you can't!? One level up you can define custom steering settings which can refer to an existing neighbor-group, but as far as I can tell there is no possibility to create your own custom neighbor-group.

> /interface/wifi/steering> add neighbor-group=test name=test

Can you actually display/print the neighbor-group (and its BSSIDs)? To me it appears that you just added a steering configuration with a reference to a non-existent neighbor-group.Edit: My bad, it works as described! As soon as you assign the steering configuration to a wifi interface, the referenced neighbor-group is created automatically. I never tried this before, as I was expecting to see an empty neighbor-group before assignment.
