Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive documentation for IP Pools on MikroTik RouterOS 7.12, within an Enterprise-level environment, focusing on your specified subnet and interface. This will be a deep dive, addressing all your requested components.

# IP Pools in MikroTik RouterOS 7.12: An Enterprise Deep Dive

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**

We are tasked with configuring a MikroTik router in an enterprise setting to provide DHCP services for devices connected to the `ether-99` interface. This interface is part of a dedicated network segment with the subnet `227.196.6.0/24`. We will create an IP Pool from which addresses are assigned. We need to ensure high availability and consider advanced features like custom lease times, multiple address ranges within the same subnet, and secure DHCP services. Additionally, we’ll explore how to manage IP pools via the REST API.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.12 (or 6.48/7.x compatibility)
*   **Configuration Level:** Expert
*   **Network Scale:** Enterprise
*   **Subnet:** 227.196.6.0/24
*   **Interface:** ether-99
*   **DHCP Server:** Required
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   Multiple IP Ranges
    *   Custom Lease Times
    *   API Management
    *   Secure Configurations
    *   HA considerations

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)

### Step-by-Step using CLI:

1.  **Add IP Addresses to Interface:**

    *   We'll assign `227.196.6.1/24` to `ether-99`. This will be our gateway IP for the subnet.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=227.196.6.1/24 interface=ether-99
    ```

2.  **Create an IP Pool:**

    *   Let's create a pool named "ether99-pool" from `227.196.6.10` to `227.196.6.200`.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=ether99-pool ranges=227.196.6.10-227.196.6.200
    ```
3.  **Configure DHCP Server:**

    *   Set up the DHCP server to use the created pool.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=ether99-pool interface=ether-99 lease-time=10m name=ether99-dhcp
    ```

4.  **Configure DHCP Network:**

    *   Add the network configuration to be provided by DHCP

    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=227.196.6.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=227.196.6.1
    ```

### Step-by-Step using Winbox:

    *   Navigate to *IP* > *Addresses*.
    *   Click the "+" button to add a new IP address.
    *   Enter `227.196.6.1/24` as the address and select `ether-99` as the interface.
    *   Click *Apply* and *OK*.

2.  **Create IP Pool:**
    *   Go to *IP* > *Pool*.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   Enter "ether99-pool" as the name.
    *   Enter `227.196.6.10-227.196.6.200` in the `Ranges` field.
    *   Click *Apply* and *OK*.

3.  **Configure DHCP Server:**
    *   Navigate to *IP* > *DHCP Server*.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   Select `ether-99` in the `Interface` field.
    *   Set the `Address Pool` to `ether99-pool` and `Lease Time` to 10m. Give the DHCP server a name (ie: ether99-dhcp)
    *   Click *Apply* and *OK*.

4.  **Configure DHCP Network:**
    *   Go to *IP* > *DHCP Server* and select the *Networks* tab.
    *   Click the "+" button.
    *   Enter `227.196.6.0/24` in the `Address` field.
    *   Set the `Gateway` field to `227.196.6.1`.
    *   Set the `DNS Servers` to `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`.
    *   Click *Apply* and *OK*.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

Here’s a consolidated view of all the CLI commands used in the above implementation:

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=227.196.6.1/24 interface=ether-99

/ip pool
add name=ether99-pool ranges=227.196.6.10-227.196.6.200

    *   `address`: The DHCP network subnet address.
    *   `dns-server`: A list of comma-separated DNS servers.
    *   `gateway`: The default gateway IP address.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Common Pitfalls:**

*   **IP Overlap:** Ensure the IP pool range doesn't overlap with other IP addresses assigned on the same subnet.
*   **Interface Mismatch:** Double-check the correct interface is specified for DHCP server operation.
*   **Firewall Blocking:** The firewall could be blocking DHCP packets, resulting in failed DHCP assignments.
*   **Misconfigured DHCP Network:** Errors in the DHCP Network address, gateway or DNS server setup
*   **Insufficient Pool Range:** Having a pool that's too small for the number of devices
*   **Incorrect Lease Times:** Short lease times can cause constant lease renewals, and long lease times can cause issues if devices move often.

**Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:**

*   **Check Logs:** Review the system logs (`/system logging`) for DHCP-related errors.

    ```mikrotik
    /system logging print topics=dhcp
    ```

*   **Packet Sniffer:** Use the built-in packet sniffer to capture DHCP packets on the interface:

    ```mikrotik
    /tool sniffer
    set filter-interface=ether-99 filter-ether-type=ip filter-udp-port=67,68
    start
    print
    stop
    ```
    Analyze the captured traffic for potential issues.

*   **Torch:** Use Torch to monitor real-time traffic:
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether-99 protocol=udp port=67,68
    ```
*   **Ping:** Confirm that your DHCP server IP is reachable.

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 227.196.6.1
    ```

*   **Lease Status:** Check the status of DHCP leases:

    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server lease print
    ```

*   **Error Scenario:** If no addresses are being assigned, ensure:
    *   The interface is up.
    *   The firewall isn’t blocking DHCP traffic (UDP ports 67 and 68).
    *   The pool has available IP addresses.
    *   The DHCP server is enabled.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Connect a Test Device:** Connect a device (laptop, VM) to the `ether-99` interface.
2.  **Verify IP Assignment:** Check that the device receives an IP address within the range `227.196.6.10-227.196.6.200`.
3.  **Test Network Connectivity:** Verify that the device can:
    *   Ping the gateway IP (227.196.6.1).
    *   Resolve DNS (e.g., `ping google.com`).
    *   Access the internet.
4.  **Check DHCP Leases:** Review the active DHCP leases in MikroTik (using CLI: `/ip dhcp-server lease print` or via Winbox in the DHCP Server's "Leases" tab).
5.  **Test Lease Renewal:** After the initial lease time, test the device obtains a new lease.
6. **Advanced testing:** Consider setting a static lease for a test device using its MAC address in the `/ip dhcp-server lease` options. Observe the assigned IP and the lease time.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Multiple Pools:** MikroTik supports multiple pools, enabling different address ranges for different purposes within the same interface.
*   **Static Leases:** Assign specific IP addresses to devices based on their MAC addresses for consistency.
*   **DHCP Options:** Configure custom DHCP options (e.g., specific DNS servers, WINS servers).
*   **DHCP Relay:** Relay DHCP requests to another DHCP server if needed.
*   **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):** Dynamic ARP entries are managed via MikroTik automatically.
*   **HA Considerations:** Configure redundancy with VRRP.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   DHCP servers are interface-specific.
    *   Complex logic within MikroTik for address allocation needs to be configured (e.g., subnetting) through IP address planning.

**Less Common Feature Scenario: Multiple Address Ranges within One Pool**

You can specify multiple ranges in a single pool:
```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=ether99-pool ranges=227.196.6.10-227.196.6.100,227.196.6.150-227.196.6.200
```

This will create a single pool where addresses from `227.196.6.10` to `227.196.6.100` and `227.196.6.150` to `227.196.6.200` are allocated.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

MikroTik provides a REST API to manage devices. Here are some relevant examples for IP Pools:

**Prerequisites:**

**Note:**
*   Ensure that the ID of the resource (*1, *2, etc) is replaced with the correct ID
*    `-k` option is used to disable SSL certificate verification, this should be removed for production
* The API paths and JSON structures depend on RouterOS version and features

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

**IP Addressing (IPv4):**
   * **Concept:** IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numeric identifiers assigned to devices to participate in an IP network. An address consists of a network and a host component.
   * **MikroTik Implementation:** RouterOS uses CIDR notation (e.g., `227.196.6.1/24`) to define an address and its network mask. Addresses are added to interfaces using `/ip address add`. The router maintains an ARP table to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.

**IP Pools:**
   * **Concept:** An IP Pool is a defined range or set of IP addresses used by DHCP servers to automatically assign to client devices.
   * **MikroTik Implementation:**  MikroTik uses the `/ip pool add` command to define the pool's name and ranges. DHCP servers are then configured to use the defined pools to assign IP addresses dynamically. The pool is used to track and prevent double assignment.
   * **Why:** Pools are used to automate and centralize IP address management. They're crucial for large networks to avoid conflicts and for DHCP servers to function.

**IP Routing:**
   * **Concept:** IP Routing is the mechanism that enables packets to be forwarded from one network to another. Each router uses routing tables to decide the next hop for a packet.
   * **MikroTik Implementation:** MikroTik supports static routes, dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP) and policy based routing. The `/ip route` command manages routing tables. MikroTik automatically creates a directly connected route for subnets that have addresses assigned to an interface.
   * **Why:** Enables communication across multiple subnets and networks. Routes direct packets to the intended destination network.

**IP Settings:**
  *   **Concept:** These settings control a router's network configuration such as how the router treats ICMP or how it handles certain TCP/IP parameters.
  *   **MikroTik Implementation:** MikroTik uses the `/ip settings` command to configure features such as TCP syncookies, ICMP rate limits, ARP timeout, etc.
  *   **Why:** These settings are used to fine-tune or enhance network functionality, and also to mitigate certain types of attacks.

**Bridging:**
   * **Concept:** A bridge acts like a switch, forwarding traffic between its ports, making the multiple interfaces behave as if they are in the same LAN.
   * **MikroTik Implementation:** Use `/interface bridge` to create a new bridge and then `/interface bridge port` to add interfaces to the bridge.
   * **Why:** Used to create a single LAN out of multiple physical interfaces. Useful for passing broadcast traffic and having multiple switches in a network topology.

**Firewall:**
   * **Concept:** A firewall inspects network traffic and either permits or denies it based on rules. Protects networks from unauthorized access and malicious traffic.
   * **MikroTik Implementation:** MikroTik's firewall operates at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP). The `/ip firewall` command manages chains and rules to filter traffic based on source/destination IPs, protocols, ports etc. Connection tracking allows stateful firewalling.
   * **Why:** Provides network security by filtering and managing network traffic, protecting against various security threats.

**DHCP:**
    *   **Concept:** DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automates the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateway addresses and other network settings to devices connected to a network.
    *   **MikroTik Implementation:** MikroTik implements both DHCP server and client functionality. The server is set to use a defined IP pool and is configured to provide network information (gateway, DNS, lease time). The client requests this information to get network connectivity.
    *   **Why:** Simplifies network administration by removing the need to statically assign IP addresses. Reduces manual overhead and possible errors.

## 9. Security Best Practices

1.  **Secure API Access:** Use strong passwords for API access, disable unneeded API services, restrict access by IP, and use HTTPS.
2.  **Firewall Hardening:** Configure firewall rules to block all unnecessary access to your router and its services. Limit access to the router management interfaces (Winbox, web, SSH, etc).
3.  **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all router accounts, including the admin account. Regularly change these passwords.
4.  **Disable Unused Services:** Disable unused services (e.g., unused VPN protocols, SOCKS proxy, etc). This reduces the attack surface.
5.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly update RouterOS to patch security vulnerabilities. Enable auto-update feature if needed.
6.  **Limit DHCP Server Access:** Enable a DHCP relay agent in the interface you want to block DHCP traffic and configure the DHCP relay with an external DHCP server.
7. **Limit Interface Access:** Limit access to the interface, for example, only allow traffic from VLANs that the interface should be associated with.
8.  **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor logs for unusual activity.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for Specified MikroTik Topics

Due to the extensive nature of this section and the limited length of a single response, I cannot provide complete, comprehensive examples for *every* item. However, I will provide *detailed* examples for many of the key areas and provide insights, including CLI commands and explanations for the others.

### IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

*   **IPv4:** We have already covered the IPv4 portion of the IP addressing in the previous sections. Adding, configuring, and managing IP addresses for interfaces.

*   **IPv6:**

    *   **Concept:** IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses designed to replace IPv4.
    *   **Configuration:** You must have an IPv6 prefix to configure an IPv6 address on your router. If you get one via DHCP-PD (Prefix Delegation) from your ISP, you will need to set up an interface to request this prefix:
        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 dhcp-client
        add add-default-route=yes interface=ether1 request=prefix use-peer-dns=yes
        ```
        Note that `ether1` should be replaced with your internet-facing interface
        Then, assign IPv6 address to your local interface using the received prefix:
       ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 address
        add address=::1/64 from-pool=isp-prefix interface=ether-99
        ```
        This assumes you created an `/ipv6 pool` named `isp-prefix` with the prefix from your ISP, or are using the built in prefix delegation.
    *   **Explanation:** IPv6 addresses are more complex than IPv4 and are typically given in a hexadecimal format such as `2001:db8::/32`. IPv6 also supports auto-configuration via Neighbor Discovery.
    *   **Trade-offs:** IPv6 offers a larger address space and better security mechanisms, but it is more complex to set up and configure. IPv6 is essential for modern networks as IPv4 addresses are becoming increasingly scarce.

### MAC Server

*   **Concept:** The MAC Server function in MikroTik provides remote access to the device via MAC-Telnet, which doesn’t rely on IP connectivity.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool mac-server
    set allowed-interface=all enabled=yes
    /tool mac-server mac-winbox
    set allowed-interface=all enabled=yes
    ```
    This enables MAC server for all interfaces. You should restrict this to selected interfaces for better security.
*   **Explanation:** Useful for troubleshooting if you lose IP connectivity. MAC-Telnet communicates directly on Layer 2 rather than relying on Layer 3 IP connectivity. MAC Winbox allows you to connect via Winbox through the MAC address.
*   **Trade-offs:** Should be enabled with caution, and restricted to secure interfaces to prevent unauthorized access.

### RoMON

*   **Concept:** RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) is a proprietary protocol by MikroTik used to connect devices for remote management through a Layer 2 (MAC) overlay, it doesn't rely on IP routing.
*   **Configuration:** Enable RoMON on devices you want to manage centrally:
   ```mikrotik
    /tool romon
    set enabled=yes id=my-router password=secure_password
    ```
    The `id` should be unique for each device.
*   **Explanation:** Allows managing multiple MikroTik routers connected in a Layer 2 network as a single management view in Winbox.
*   **Trade-offs:** Secure the RoMON password.  Use carefully, only where needed as it can generate additional broadcast traffic, but a very powerful management tool when implemented correctly.

### Winbox

*   **Concept:** Winbox is MikroTik’s GUI administration tool, designed to operate on Layer 2.
*   **Usage:** Connect directly via IP address of the router, or via MAC address, using a discovery tool that scans for nearby MikroTik devices.
*   **Explanation:** An alternative to the CLI or API for most operations, making it ideal for users who are not as familiar with command-line interfaces.

### Certificates

*   **Concept:** Certificates are used for secure communication, such as HTTPS, VPNs, and other secure services.
*   **Configuration:** RouterOS can generate self-signed certificates or import trusted certificates from a certificate authority.
    ```mikrotik
    /certificate
    add name=my-cert common-name=my.router.local generate-key=yes days-valid=365
    ```
    Then use `/certificate sign my-cert` to self-sign the certificate.
*   **Explanation:** Essential for securing services and communication. Certificates can protect user passwords, private data, and authenticate servers and devices
*   **Trade-offs:** Self-signed certificates don't provide the same level of trust as CA-signed certificates. They can only be used if every client agrees to "trust" the certificate.

### PPP AAA

*   **Concept:** PPP AAA (Point-to-Point Protocol Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) manages authentication and authorization of PPP connections using Radius or locally defined user accounts.
*   **Configuration:** You would need to create a PPP profile:
    ```mikrotik
    /ppp profile
    add name=ppp_profile_secure local-address=172.16.0.1 remote-address=172.16.0.2 dns-server=8.8.8.8
    ```
   And configure a PPP server, such as PPPoE:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface pppoe-server server
    add service-name=pppoe_server_secure interface=ether-99 authentication=pap,chap profile=ppp_profile_secure
    ```
*   **Explanation:** It's a crucial service for secure access to your network via PPP connections, such as through PPPoE, PPTP, and L2TP. AAA provides control over which devices and users are allowed access.
*   **Trade-offs:** Radius authentication adds complexity but provides better user management than local user accounts.

### RADIUS

*   **Concept:** RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a networking protocol for AAA.
*   **Configuration:** Configure Radius server details in the `/radius` menu and set services like PPP or Hotspot to use it.
    ```mikrotik
    /radius
    add address=192.168.1.100 secret=radius_secret service=ppp timeout=10ms
    ```
    Then configure a PPP server to use this Radius config for authentication
    ```mikrotik
    /interface pppoe-server server
    set 0 authentication=radius profile=ppp_profile_secure
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Centralizes user authentication and accounting. RADIUS servers also provide accounting information (connection time, data transfer, etc).
*   **Trade-offs:** Adds complexity but greatly enhances user management for larger network environments.

### User / User groups

*   **Concept:** User and user groups management in RouterOS allows you to manage access to the RouterOS interface and restrict/provide access to only what they need.
*   **Configuration:** Create new users with specific permissions:
    ```mikrotik
    /user
    add name=new_user password=user_password group=read
    ```
    Then, you can create user groups and assign user access permissions.
    ```mikrotik
    /user group
    add name=monitor policy=read,test
    ```
    Then you can use the group in new or existing user accounts.
*   **Explanation:** Enables you to add users with custom access levels to the RouterOS system, limiting access to users according to their needs.
*   **Trade-offs:**  Carefully create groups and limit permissions to specific users.

### Bridging and Switching

*   **Concept:** As mentioned earlier, bridging creates Layer 2 networks. Switching occurs on a switch chip, providing high-speed local connectivity.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge
    add name=my-bridge
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether2
    add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether3
    ```
    This will create a bridge called `my-bridge` and adds interfaces `ether2` and `ether3` to this bridge.
*   **Explanation:** Bridges combine multiple interfaces into a single Layer 2 network, while switching uses switch hardware for efficient packet forwarding within the same Layer 2 domain.
*   **Trade-offs:** Bridging increases broadcast domains. Make sure that loops aren't created in the bridged interfaces.

### MACVLAN

*   **Concept:** MACVLAN allows creation of multiple virtual MAC interfaces on a single physical interface.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface macvlan
    add interface=ether2 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01 name=macvlan1
    add interface=ether2 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:02 name=macvlan2
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Useful for scenarios where you need multiple MAC addresses on the same physical link. MACVLAN is commonly used for running network appliances such as virtual routers, firewalls, and NAT instances.
*   **Trade-offs:**  Might require support from a switch if you connect the MACVLAN interface to a different device.

### L3 Hardware Offloading

*   **Concept:** L3 Hardware Offloading allows the router's switch chip or the CPU itself to handle certain layer 3 tasks at high speed.
*   **Configuration:** Some MikroTik devices with switch chips or capable CPU offer offload options for bridge or interfaces.  This setting is typically found in the bridge or interface configuration dialogs in winbox, or in the specific configuration pages in the CLI.
*   **Explanation:**  Enhances router performance by offloading routing tasks from the CPU to more efficient hardware components.
*   **Trade-offs:** Offloading might reduce flexibility for advanced configurations and also might have limited feature support.

### MACsec

*   **Concept:** MACsec is an IEEE standard for encrypting Ethernet frames to provide secure communication at layer 2.
*   **Configuration:** Requires the use of a secure key, which is commonly used via a RADIUS server.
  ```mikrotik
  /interface ethernet security
  add interface=ether2 confidentiality=required
  ```
  You must also have a profile configured on the device, or on the RADIUS server.
*   **Explanation:** Secures Layer 2 communications, which helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing.
*   **Trade-offs:** Increases configuration complexity, and only supported with specific hardware or software features enabled on both sides of the link.

### Quality of Service

*   **Concept:** QoS is used to prioritize certain traffic over others to ensure that critical applications or users get better bandwidth and latency.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /queue simple
    add max-limit=10M/10M name=voip target=227.196.6.0/24 priority=1
    add max-limit=2M/2M name=default-traffic target=227.196.6.0/24 queue=default priority=8
    ```
   This creates two queues for traffic in the specified range: `voip` traffic gets priority 1, and `default-traffic` gets a lower priority of 8.
*   **Explanation:** QoS ensures fair bandwidth usage and prevents network congestion. Critical applications are given priority and can be allocated more bandwidth.
*   **Trade-offs:** Involves careful planning to prevent configuration errors and possible misconfigurations.

### Switch Chip Features

*   **Concept:** Switch chips in MikroTik devices have certain features like VLAN tagging, port isolation, and flow control.
*   **Configuration:** VLAN configurations for a device's switch chip are typically configured via `/interface ethernet switch vlan` and `/interface ethernet switch port`.
*   **Explanation:** These features offload certain network functions from the CPU for higher performance.
*   **Trade-offs:** Can be specific to the switch chip and its capabilities.

### VLAN

*   **Concept:** VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are used to segment networks logically, allowing devices in different VLANs to be separated from each other.
*   **Configuration:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add interface=ether2 name=vlan100 vlan-id=100
    add interface=ether2 name=vlan200 vlan-id=200
    /interface bridge port
    add bridge=my-bridge interface=vlan100 pvid=100
    add bridge=my-bridge interface=vlan200 pvid=200
    ```
    This creates two VLANs (100 and 200) on interface `ether2`. It then adds them to the bridge `my-bridge` with their corresponding PVIDs.
*   **Explanation:** VLANs enhance network security, organization, and management, particularly in complex environments.
*   **Trade-offs:** Improperly set VLAN configurations can break connectivity and network communication.

### VXLAN

*   **Concept:** VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a layer-2 encapsulation protocol that creates a logical overlay over an existing network, which allows to extend layer 2 networks across IP boundaries
*   **Configuration:**
  ```mikrotik
    /interface vxlan
    add name=vxlan100 vni=100 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01  remote-address=192.168.2.100 interface=ether1
  ```
  This will create a VXLAN tunnel to remote IP `192.168.2.100` using VNI `100` and interface `ether1`
*   **Explanation:** Helps to create stretched networks across IP boundaries and provides multi tenancy capabilities
*   **Trade-offs:** Complex to setup and can add overhead in terms of CPU usage and packet sizes.

### Firewall and Quality of Service

*   **Concept:** We already touched on the basics. The firewall allows controlling traffic flow through rules based on source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and state. QoS (simple or PCQ queues) allows for managing bandwidth allocation.
*   **Configuration:** See examples in previous sections for basic configurations. More advanced configurations can use address lists, mangling and connection tracking, etc.
*   **Explanation:** Critical for maintaining network security and optimal performance.
*   **Trade-offs:** Requires deep understanding to avoid blocking legitimate traffic.

### IP Services

*   **DHCP:** Configured as previously explained.
*   **DNS:** Configured in `/ip dns`, enable the DNS cache
