I have a switch (CRS312-4C+8xg) and 2 AP's (cAP ax).  They are all running RouterOS 7.16.2.I'm trying to configure Capsman on the switch, but it appears it's running the "old" capsman version.  It doesn't show configs for 80mhz channels, WPA 3 etc.How do I upgrade Capsman?  I've seen tons of posts and references to the new version, but zero pages telling me how to install it.

You don't, CAPsMAN is automatically installed with version 7.13.x and up.It has moved, can be configured on /interface wifi (or the wifi menu item).Here is a link to the official documentation:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... iFiCAPsMANAnd...if you don't use the old CAPsMAN, you could consider removing the wireless package (which is of no use).
