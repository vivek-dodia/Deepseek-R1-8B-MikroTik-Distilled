## Initial Question
Good evening, Mikrotik Team and Community.I would like to kindly ask the Mikrotik Community to vote for a following feature in the android app.Please add the ability to arrange a bookmarks on the main app screen - right below the CPU/Mem and above 'Other settings'.These bookmarks can lead to any existing page for example to Wireless->Registration, or IP->Firewall->Connections, or Tools->Netwatch, or Interfaces->Interface->eth5->Traffic etc. Any existing page can be bookmarked and can be visible on the main app page.The bookmarks order can be also changed.It will improve the app usability because if a user frequently needs a certain page then it can open it in one tap right after sign in. Instead of navigating in the menu tree.I asked for this feature twice by the email and twice received the answer - they will consider implementing it only if more people will ask for it too.Thanks in advance.SUP-154828 ---

What? You dont want a stilted design based on absolutely no HFE and MMI lessons learned, how impetuous.I do not blame anybody, I understand that this whole ecosystem is for people who rule in the black scary terminals, so do I.Mikrotik Support told me that they will implement this feature if they will receive more similar requests, I just wonder how many requests are enough.9 votes are not so bad. Will wait a little bit more time and come back to them. ---
