Hi, I have a MikroTik hAP ac3. Almost every time I update it, it crashes, and I have to reset it and reload the configuration. Any tips on a solution or what might be causing this? (I'm running 6.49.17 now)

- Today, for example, I updated to the latest version.- Restarted.- Connected via Wi-Fi.- Then, after a few seconds, everything (the network) dropped.- The modem stopped blinking.- Performed a reset and logged in with the default settings. Did a new update, updated the routerboard, and restored the configuration.- Everything is working normally again.

My first approach would be to netinstall to latest ROS6.Then import config block by block via terminal, don't restore from backup because you will bring the problems right back in.It's a working assumption for most experienced users here that after upgrade to upgrade to upgrade ... some blobs can remain in config causing havoc (not visible but binary they are there).Netinstall makes sure to clean all that garbage.

I understand, but if I import block by block, won't I just bring the problem back again? Can't the exported file be cleaned up somehow? I currently have a solution to the problem that is relatively quick, but going through all the steps you mentioned seems like it will take a lot of time.

I currently have a solution to the problem that is relatively quick, but going through all the steps you mentioned seems like it will take a lot of time.No, the point is that the export is either clean or can be easily cleaned (or corrected), but there is (probably) some "cruft" that does not belong to (nor shows in) an export, you need to clean this "invisible" part (netinstall) and re-apply the exported settings (block by block, NOT by restoring a backup) this is the only way to make sure that the *whatever* is invisible is the "standard", "factory" default and is not corrupted/altered (for *whatever* reason that happened)

it will be good to write full pack from netinstall to latest version, because I have started from routeros-arm-6.47.9(found on internet) and when jumped I guess on 6.49.xx something and whenupgrade: 7.12.1. now latest is 7.17.thing is previous user did some updates, I don't know details but somehow it was on 7.15. and WiFi was not working without wireless package.it's interesting to have really good understanding as I'm only using one package since NET install:D
