I managed to solve the issue.Forlocal interfaces wifi-qcom-acon the MT where you runCapsman2 with VLANS:set up interfaces (main and secondary) with vlan tag in Interface menuadd local wifi interfaces to vlan rules on the bridgea and b settings are simillar to section 'CAP using "wifi-qcom-ac" package' inhttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... %22package:the only difference is that you do not set option configuration.manager=capsman on local interfacedo not provision config on local radionor set local radio as controlled by capsman. do not enable CAP on local radio. (provisioning on local radio would remove your interfaces and vlan settings from point a and b.)in WIFI menu set up previously defined configurations which you normally use in capsman configurationWhen FT is enabled in the configuration which you use for cap and local radios - roaming should work.A note from help turns to be trueFor a client device to successfully roam between 2 APs, the APs need to be managed by thesame instance of RouterOS.To check FT works:- go to /system/logging and add a rule for topic: wireless- you can temporarily disable all rules beside wireless- see logs. you should get something similar to:00:00:00:MAC@wifi1roamedto 00:00:00:MAC@CAP-2g-, signal strength -73Michal
