## Initial Question
I have RB5009 and I want to setup Home Assistant there.There is a USB flash installed and used for container
```

---
```

## Response 1
Have you tried enabling logging "container, debug"? Maybe he'll show what he's missing? ---

## Response 2
Have just logging=yes in the container it salves.Can you give me a hint how to enable debug logging? ---

## Response 3
```
/system loggingaddtopics=container,debug action=memory

---
```

## Response 4
Thank you, but does not helps. No records in log aftercontainer start 0 ---

## Response 5
Also check if all the points specified in this article are followed.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... eAssistant ---

## Response 6
When I'm pulling the image it does shows log records ---

## Response 7
Has the container been downloaded completely? No errors at the end? (this happens sometimes)Is container mode enabled?
```
/system/device-mode/update container=yes

---
```

## Response 8
It it has status "extracting" for a while and I can see how it is pulling layers in the log.Than the status is tiring into "stopped".Sure containers are enabled otherwise I won't be able to pull an image.
```
[admin@MikroTik]>/system/device-modeprintmode:enterprise
  container:yes

---
```

## Response 9
Can you please provide your full configuration?
```
/exportfile=config

---
```

## Response 10
The last message in the log before container status turns to "stop" is
```

```

```

---
```

## Response 11
Also i think your container is not properly deployed, from your recording it is visible that OS and arch is missing.

---
```

## Response 12
Try removing the container completely. Format USB and try again ---

## Response 13
I've had the same problem for months, I've never been able to figure out where the problem was.I tried to format the USB disk also changing the filesystem but nothing to do, it always stops at the same point:mikrotik ha.pngThe file download always stops at 171BI don't know if it's a ROS bug... ---

## Response 14
I'm trying to pullstableimage.Errors a totally random every time.Some times it pulls arch and os and some times it is not.I was trying all formats of the flash. With and without MBR.What is consistent is it is always stuck on this layer.From it's size I can see it is that one

## Response 15
I had issues with my HASS container not starting on my hAP AX3 and after some debugging I determined that I needed to disable jemalloc which is described here -https://www.home-assistant.io/installat ... imizationsYou can disable it by simply adding the env variable DISABLE_JEMALLOC=1Might not be your case but thought it worth mentioning. Runs fine after this is set for me. ---

## Response 16
You can disable it by simply adding the env variable DISABLE_JEMALLOC=1Thank you, but it doesn't helps in my case.If the flash is formatted with MBD it always ends up witherrorstatus.If the flash is formatted without MBD it always ends up withstoppedstatus and not starts no matter what.(Sure I'm changing path everywhere accordingly usb1/usb1-part1) ---

## Response 17
Try to load as a file. With no luck so far...After command

Try to load as a file. With no luck so far...I also tried to load as file a few weeks ago without success... at this point only MikroTik support can help us, have you already created a ticket? ---

## Response 19
..only MikroTik support can help us, have you already created a ticket?No. I do not think they will help with 3rd party software which HA is. ---

## Response 20
Out of curiosity I tried now with a hAP ax3 and it works perfectly!ha2.pngha1.png ---

## Response 21
I checked on hAP ac3 and everything works. Perhaps something with the RB5009, but I don't have it to check ---

## Response 22
It is interesting, is anybody has positive experience installing HA on RB5009? ---

## Response 23
It is interesting, is anybody has positive experience installing HA on RB5009?In a quick test on RB5009 (arm64), I get a layer error (specifically, "error getting layer: resolving error" when downloading a layer). On RB1100Ahx4 (arm/v7), it imports and goes to start.There is a Traefik container that works fine on same RB5009, so /container is enabled/working otherwise. You might want to try an older tag of HA instead of latest, dunno.It should work since Mikrotik specifically documents how to set it up:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... eAssistant ---

It eats like it is not there.b) The container is in 10.10.0.1 and all my devices are in 192.168.88.1. And it seams like 10.10.0.1 is not visible from within 192.168.88.1. So I can't add the home assistant as a hub to Apple Home so far.UPDATE:ffmpeg is there but working with some errors. But it is not related to Mikrotik for sure ---

## Response 25
To all:It is not possible to pull the latest image or even stable image of homeassistant for arm64 on Mikrotik RB5009, because the size of image is more then 1.5GB, but the storage on RB5009 is only 1GB, you must change your settings in container to use usb disk for pulling-downloading images:
```
container/config/settmpdir=usb1/pullBest regards!

## Response 27
PS C:\Users\allan> docker save -o ha_arm64.tarEven if "ha_arm64.tar" wasn't bound as the option to the -o flag, making it unavailable to be interpreted as the "IMAGE" argument, it it isn't an "IMAGE" in the context of that command at all. The -o flag names an OCI imagearchive, not the same thing. The "save" command wants the actualinputimage name:
```
docker save-o ha_arm64.tar homeassistant/home-assistant:latestBeware thedocumented limitationsof the HASS container. I faced this decision myself just yesterday, and while I found lack of one-click upgrades of little concern â€” the container engine handles that for you â€” lack of add-on support and broken backups doesn't work for me at all. I went with the HAOS VM image instead, now running on my NAS.

## Response 28
Has anyone found a solution to this problem. The image is showing in usb1/pull as a tar.gzip file, was around 300mb but now showing as 171B.I am using Mikrotik L009 which supports container and advertises that it supports home assistant.I am following the Mikrotik instructions to the letter.Any help would be appreciated. ---

was around 300mb but now showing as 171B.See my previous message:viewtopic.php?t=208697&sid=87d3bc06e309 ... a#p1082019I have the same problem with hAP ac2 and I have never been able to understand the cause. ---
