Hello,Is it possible to create a rule on CAPsMAN (access list, firewall... wherever) that the wireless uses a password at a specific time and to be open beyond that time?For example, who knows the password can use wifi all the time and who doesn't know the password can use from 10 - 11h and 13 - 14h.

IMHO this is impossible with single SSID. but you can use one SSID protected and one open SSID and use access list rules for the open SSID.

No problem:Use /system scheduler for the scheduling part and /sysstem/script for enabling/disabling the wifi interface.

Access list have time filter. no need for scheduler Scripting

Thank you for answers. I will probably create slave interface on CAPsMAN for second configuration, leave it open and use access list for time interval.

PS: Don't forget the "default reject" rule for this secondary SSID. Allow by specific time and final rule is a reject.
