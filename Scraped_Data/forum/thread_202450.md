Is it possible to configure code 67 within an option set using option matcher? I've observed that unless I specify the boot file name under network settings, the boot file doesn't get applied, while other settings do. I'm seeking advice on how to effectively designate a boot file using either an option matcher or a MAC static lease, as both methods don't seem to be functioning as expected. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.mikrotik 7.13rc4/ip dhcp-server optionadd code=60 name=DOCSIS_option value="'docsis'"add code=66 name=TFTPServer value="'100.64.0.1'"add code=67 name=BootFileName value="'20mb.bin'"add code=67 name=Wall value="'wall.bin'"add code=43 name=NTPServer value="'100.64.0.1'"add code=7 name=syslogserver value="'100.64.0.1'"/ip dhcp-server option setsadd name=DOCSIS3Options options=TFTPServer,NTPServer,syslogserver,BootFileNameadd name=Wall options=TFTPServer,Wall,NTPServer/ip pooladd name=dhcp_pool0 ranges=100.64.0.2-100.64.0.254/ip dhcp-serveradd address-pool=dhcp_pool0 interface=bridge1 name=dhcp1/ip dhcp-server matcheradd address-pool=dhcp_pool0 code=60 name=match1 option-set=DOCSIS3Options \value=docsis3.1/ip dhcp-server networkadd address=100.64.0.0/24 boot-file-name=20.bin dns-server=100.64.0.1 gateway=\100.64.0.1/ip tftpadd real-filename=fast.bin req-filename=20.binadd real-filename=wall.bin req-filename=wall.bin/system loggingadd topics=dhcp/system noteset show-at-login=no/system ntp serverset enabled=yes/tool snifferset filter-interface=ether1 filter-stream=yes streaming-enabled=yes \streaming-server=100.64.0.253if I don't set 20.bin the dhcp server network doesn't send the boot file nameas seen below (edited)image.pngdhcp offerimage1.png

Maybe, 67 file 20mb.bin and the file is 20.bin?

if that was the case 20.bin would in in the DHCP offer but it isn't.going forward assume 20.bin for everything. I did attempt to change it to 20mb.bin but no change.

Can anyone verify DHCP option matcher works? And provide a working configuration based on the info I provided?

I think you need to provide bootfile name via bootp via this commands.boot-file-name (string; Default: )next-server (IP; Default: )https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:I ... r#Networks

If I want to have dynamic boot files for cable modems, I would like to make use of the mikrotiks built in DHCP options matcher and push next server and boot file.

I was finally able to fix the problem last night.apparently bootp need to be set to dynamic and dhcp option 66 has a bug where you have to put the value in hex? the rest of the settings work without an issue with strings.

Hello good morning how are you, I hope you are well, I am also trying to get the docsis provisioning to work through mikrotik, I was trying that same config, but I get an error from what I see in the modem log when it asks the configuration file "init(o) - modem ready to download config file" any suggestions? I also tried putting the dhcp option value ip in hexadecimal and I see that it gives me this error in the mikrotik log Unknown(66) = 64-40-00-01Thanks
