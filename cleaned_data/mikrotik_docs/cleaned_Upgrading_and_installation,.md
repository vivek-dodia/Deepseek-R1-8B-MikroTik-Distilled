# Overview
MikroTik devices are preinstalled with RouterOS, so installation is usually not needed, except in the case where installing RouterOS on an x86 PC or virtual instance CHR. The upgrade procedure on already installed devices is straightforward.
# Upgrading
# Version numbering
RouterOS versions are numbered sequentially when a period is used to separate sequences, it doesnotrepresent a decimal point, and the sequences donothave positional significance. An identifier of 2.5, for instance, is not "two and a half" or "halfway to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision. Therefore v5.2 is older than v5.18, which is newer.
RouterOS versions are released in several "release chains": Long term, Stable, Testing, and Development. When upgrading RouterOS, you can choose a release chain from which to install the new packages.
# Standard upgrade
The package upgrade feature connects to the MikroTik download servers and checks if there is another RouterOS version for your device under the selected release channel. Can also be used for downgrading, if you, for example, are using stable release at the moment, but changed the release channel to the long-term.
After clicking theCheck For Updatesbutton in QuickSet (or in the System â†’ Packages menu) theCheck For Updateswindow will open with the current or the latest changelog (if a newer version exists). If newer version exists, buttonsDownloadandDownload&Installwill appear. By cicking theDownloadbutton a newest version will be downloaded (manual device reboot is required), by clickingDownload&Install, download will start, and after a successful download will reboot a device to install the downloaded packages.
The versions offered will depend on the selected release channel. Not all versions migh be available. It will not be possible to upgrade from an older version to the latest version in one go, when using check-for-updates approach. For example, if running RouterOS v6.x, even selecting the major release upgrade channel, called "Upgrade", you will only see v7.12.1 as the available version. You must first upgrade to that intermediate version and only then newer releases will be available in the channels. This intermediate step can be done using check for updates too, but you will simply have to repeat check for updates after the first update to the intermediate version.
If custom packages are installed, the downloader will take that into account and download all necessary packages.
You canautomatethe upgrade process by running a script in the system scheduler. This script queries the MikroTik upgrade servers for new versions, if the response received says "New version is available", the script then issues the upgrade command below. Important note, this will not work, if you are running it for the first time on a release that is older. It might not see latest versions as available, if you are running v6.x, you would first have to manually select the "Upgrade" channel to do a major release upgrade to v7.12.1 intermediate version, and only afterwards newer v7 releases will be visible in the upgrade channels.
```
[admin@MikroTik] >/system package update
check-for-updates once
:delay 3s;
:if ( [get status] = "New version is available") do={ install }
```
# Manual upgrade
You can upgrade RouterOS in the following ways:
# Manual upgrade process
Menu:/system/package/update installignore-missingcommand allows upgrading only the RouterOS main package, while omitting packages that are either missing or not uploaded during a manual upgrade process.
# Using WinBox
Choose your system type, and download the upgrade package. Connect to your router with WinBox, Select the downloaded file with your mouse, and drag it to the Files menu. If some files are already present, make sure to put the package in the root menu, not inside the hotspot folder! The upload will start.
After it finishes - reboot the device. The New version number will be seen in the Winbox Title and in the Packages menu
# Using FTP
```

[admin@MikroTik] >/system reboot
Reboot, yes? [y/N]: y

[admin@MikroTik] >/system package print

[admin@MikroTik] >/log print without-paging

# RouterOS local upgrade

```
You can upgrade one or multiple MikroTik routers within your local network by using one device which have all needed packages. Feature is available from7.17beta3version in (system > packages local update) and will replace (system > auto update) feature. Here is a simple example with 3 routers (the same method works on networks with infinite numbers of routers):
Place needed packages under Files menu, on your main router:
Optional, you can set mirror device between main one, if not needed, skip this step:
# RouterOS upgrade using Dude
# The Dude auto-upgrade
The dude application can help you to upgrade the entire RouterOS network with one click per router.
# The Dude hierarchical upgrade
For complicated networks, when routers are connected sequentially, the simplest example is "1router-2router-3router| connection. You might get an issue, 2router will go to reboot before packages are uploaded to the 3router. The solution is Dude Groups, the feature allows you to group routers and upgrade all of them with one click!
# License issues
When upgrading from older versions, there could be issues with your license key. Possible scenarios:
# Netinstall
NetInstallis a widely-used installation tool for RouterOS. It runs on Windows systems or via a command-line tool, netinstall-cli, on Linux, or through Wine (with superuser permissions required).
The NetInstall utilities can be downloaded from theMikroTikdownloadsection.
NetInstallis also used to re-install RouterOS in cases where a previous installation has failed, been damaged, or where access passwords have been lost.
To use NetInstall, your device must support booting from Ethernet, with a direct Ethernet connection between the NetInstall computer and the target device. All RouterBOARDs support PXE network booting, which can be enabled in the RouterOS "routerboard" menu (if RouterOS is accessible) or in the bootloader settings using a serial console cable.
Note:For RouterBOARD devices without a serial port or RouterOS access, you can activate PXE booting using theReset button.
NetInstallcan also directly install RouterOS onto a disk (USB/CF/IDE/SATA) connected to the NetInstall Windows machine. Once installed, simply transfer the disk to the Router machine and boot from it.
Attention!Do not try to install RouterOS on your system drive. Action will format your hard drive and wipe out your existing OS.
