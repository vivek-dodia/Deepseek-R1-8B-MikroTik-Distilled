# MikroTik RouterOS: Advanced IP Addressing and Networking Configuration

This document provides a detailed guide for configuring IP addressing and related networking features on a MikroTik router running RouterOS 7.12. It is geared towards advanced users managing small to medium-sized business (SMB) networks.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** A small business needs to set up its internal network on the 48.31.242.0/24 subnet, using a wireless interface named `wlan-24`. The goal is to provide network connectivity to clients connected to this wireless interface, including DHCP addressing, internet access, and basic security measures. This scenario will be built out to include relevant and less common features to demonstrate advanced functionality.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS Version: 7.12 (with notes applicable to 6.48 and 7.x)
*   Wireless Interface: `wlan-24` must be properly configured.
*   IPv4 Subnet: 48.31.242.0/24
*   DHCP Server: Must provide IP addresses within the subnet.
*   NAT:  Must be configured for internet access.
*   Firewall: Basic security measures will be implemented.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation Using CLI and Winbox

Here's a step-by-step guide, covering CLI and Winbox options:

### Step 1: Configure the Wireless Interface

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /interface wireless
    set wlan1 disabled=no mode=ap-bridge ssid="MyBusinessWiFi" band=2ghz-b/g/n channel-width=20mhz frequency=2437
    set wlan1 name=wlan-24
    /interface wireless security-profiles
    add name=my-wifi-profile mode=dynamic-keys authentication-types=wpa2-psk wpa2-pre-shared-key="YourStrongPassword"
    /interface wireless set wlan-24 security-profile=my-wifi-profile
    ```

    *   `wlan1` is renamed to `wlan-24`, ensure you change it to the proper interface if needed.
    *   `ssid` is the name of the Wi-Fi.
    *   `band`, `channel-width`, and `frequency` are examples.
    *   `my-wifi-profile` should be unique and secure.

*   **Winbox:**
    *   Go to `Wireless` -> `Interfaces`, find your wireless interface (e.g., `wlan1`), and enable it.
    *   Rename `wlan1` to `wlan-24`.
    *   Go to `Security Profiles`, add a profile, select `WPA2 PSK` and enter a strong passphrase. Assign this security profile to `wlan-24`.

### Step 2: Configure IP Address on the Interface

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=48.31.242.1/24 interface=wlan-24
    ```
    *   This assigns the IP address `48.31.242.1` to the `wlan-24` interface.

*   **Winbox:**
    *   Go to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
    *   Click the `+` button and add `48.31.242.1/24` with the interface `wlan-24`.

### Step 3: Configure a DHCP Server

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool ranges=48.31.242.10-48.31.242.254
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=wlan-24 lease-time=10m authoritative=yes
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=48.31.242.0/24 gateway=48.31.242.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```
    *   `ranges` specifies the range of IP addresses that will be leased out.
    *   `lease-time` is how long each IP lease will last (10 minutes in this example).
    *   `authoritative=yes` means this server is the single DHCP server for the network.
    *   `dns-server` specifies which DNS servers clients will use.

*   **Winbox:**
    *   Go to `IP` -> `Pool`, add a new pool named `dhcp_pool`.
    *   Go to `IP` -> `DHCP Server`, add a DHCP server using `dhcp_pool` and the `wlan-24` interface.
    *   Go to `IP` -> `DHCP Server` -> `Networks`, add the network configuration with `48.31.242.0/24`, gateway `48.31.242.1`, and DNS server details.

### Step 4: Configure NAT for Internet Access

*   **CLI:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall nat
    add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=WAN
    ```
    *   `WAN` must be replaced with your internet-facing interface. This could be eth1, pppoe-out1, etc. This enables internet access for clients on this subnet.

*   **Winbox:**
    *   Go to `IP` -> `Firewall` -> `NAT` tab.
    *   Add a new rule, set `chain` to `srcnat`, `out. interface` to your WAN interface, and action to `masquerade`.

### Step 5: Implement Basic Firewall Rules
*  **CLI**

    ```mikrotik
     /ip firewall filter
     add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow established/related connections"
     add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Allow ICMP"
     add chain=input in-interface=WAN action=drop comment="Drop all other input connections on WAN"
     add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow established/related forward connections"
     add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forward connections"
    ```
*  **Winbox**
   *Go to `IP` -> `Firewall` -> `Filter Rules`
   * Add an input rule to allow establised and related connections.
   * Add an input rule to allow ICMP.
   * Add an input rule to drop other connections on the WAN interface
   * Add a forward rule to allow established and related connections
   * Add a forward rule to drop all other forward connections.

## 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

Here is the complete CLI configuration, combining the previous steps into one block:

set wlan1 name=wlan-24
/interface wireless security-profiles
add name=my-wifi-profile mode=dynamic-keys authentication-types=wpa2-psk wpa2-pre-shared-key="YourStrongPassword"
/interface wireless set wlan-24 security-profile=my-wifi-profile
/ip address
add address=48.31.242.1/24 interface=wlan-24
/ip pool
add name=dhcp_pool ranges=48.31.242.10-48.31.242.254
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=wlan-24 lease-time=10m authoritative=yes
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=48.31.242.0/24 gateway=48.31.242.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=WAN
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow established/related connections"
add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Allow ICMP"
add chain=input in-interface=WAN action=drop comment="Drop all other input connections on WAN"
add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow established/related forward connections"
add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forward connections"
```

**Note:** Replace `YourStrongPassword`, `wlan1` (if necessary), and `WAN` with your actual values.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Common Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect Interface:** Forgetting to rename the wireless interface or selecting the wrong one in the DHCP server setup.
*   **Conflicting IP Addresses:** Overlapping IP ranges with other subnets or misconfigured static IP addresses on the same network.
*   **Firewall Issues:**  NAT rules misconfigured to block access to the internet, or overly restrictive firewall rules.
*   **DHCP Issues:** DHCP pool exhaustion, or misconfigured DNS settings
*   **Wireless Issues:** Weak signal, channel interference, and incorrect security settings.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Check Interface Status:** Use `/interface print` to check if `wlan-24` is enabled and running.
*   **IP Address Verification:** Use `/ip address print` to check if the IP is correctly assigned to the interface.
*   **DHCP Server Status:** Use `/ip dhcp-server print` and `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to check if DHCP is working and IPs are being leased.
*   **NAT Rule Check:** Use `/ip firewall nat print` to check if the `masquerade` rule exists and has the correct `out-interface`.
*   **Firewall Rule Check:** Use `/ip firewall filter print` to see if there any obvious rules that would block traffic.
*   **Ping Test:** Use `/ping 48.31.242.1` from the router to test its IP address, then `/ping 8.8.8.8` for internet access (when NAT is enabled).
*   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-24` to see live traffic on the interface. This can help to diagnose issues at the protocol level.
*    **Log:** Use `/system logging print` to view current logs, these logs can provide additional information for diagnosing issues.
*   **Packet Sniffer:** Use `/tool sniffer start` to capture raw network traffic, this is helpful for debugging complex routing issues.

**Error Scenarios and Diagnostics:**

*   **Scenario:** Clients cannot obtain IP addresses.
    *   **Diagnosis:**
        *   Check DHCP server is running: `/ip dhcp-server print`
        *   Check DHCP pool: `/ip pool print` and ensure address pool is within the 48.31.242.0/24 subnet
        *   Check logs for DHCP errors: `/system logging print`
        *   Use `/tool sniffer` on the interface to check for DHCP requests and responses.
*   **Scenario:** Clients can connect to Wi-Fi but cannot access the internet.
    *   **Diagnosis:**
        *   Check the NAT rule: `/ip firewall nat print` (ensure the `out-interface` is correct.)
        *   Ping the gateway address (48.31.242.1): `/ping 48.31.242.1`.
        *   Ping an external IP, example, 8.8.8.8: `/ping 8.8.8.8`. This confirms internet connectivity from the router itself.
        *   Check firewall rules: `/ip firewall filter print` and look for rules which would drop traffic.
        *   Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-24` to monitor traffic.
        *   Ensure DNS is properly configured in DHCP network: `/ip dhcp-server network print`
*   **Scenario:** Clients are not connecting to the Wi-Fi
    *   **Diagnosis:**
        *   Ensure the correct Wi-Fi password is being used.
        *   Check signal strength
        *   Check for radio frequency interference.
