Hi! I appeal to the developers of IOS-7.We are an ISP.ROS-7 does not have the /ip/route/check tool, which is available in ROS-6.This is the command we use the most in ROS-6.The lack of this tool in ROS-7 makes it very difficult to work./ip/route/print where 8.8.8.8 in dst-address routing-table=main activeit takes a long time to type and does not show which interface the traffic is going through.Return this tool, plz

It works with IPv4 but there is no equivalent /ipv6/route/check for IPv6 yet. /ip/route/check understandably does not accept IPv6 destination addresses.
