## Initial Question
Author: Sat Jan 04, 2025 7:19 pm
Hi everyone, does anyone have any experience with the Cube Pro over 2.4km? I need to make a 1gbps link at 2.8km and I would like to understand if I should use or discard the product ---

Use Tachyon Networks or Ubiquiti Wave 60GHz. Cube's won't do that distance. ---

Ubiquiti AF60LR will get you 2Gbps aggregate (1Gbps "full duplex"), and Wave LR will get you 1500Mbps aggregate (up to 1Gbps each way and 500 the other, or 700-800ish both ways simultaneously). Wave LR has a backup 5GHz radio in case of rain fade, although at that distance both radios should be pretty solid. ---
