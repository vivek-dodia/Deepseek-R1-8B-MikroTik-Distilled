Hey everyone, I'm new to Mikrotik and I'm trying to get a better understanding of it. I'm wondering why this script has different syntax but the same output. Is there anyone who can explain it to me? thank youCode:Select allCode:Select all

```
:localaUsrNote[/ip hotspot usergetname=$user comment];
```

```
:localaUsrNote[/ip hotspot usergetname="$user"comment];
```

```
:localaUsrNote[/ip hotspot usergetname="$username"comment];
```

the first iswrong, because find results is one array, andgetdo not accept arrays as parameters.Coincidentally if exist only one possible results from find, it work, because pass only one array with one single itemThank you very much sir rex. what about this.Code:Select allCode:Select allCode:Select alla little confuse with" ",$userand$username
