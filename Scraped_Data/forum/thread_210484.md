I guess that what erlinden asked for as "logging" was meant as:Code:Select alland copy and paste a few related lines of the log around the "probably loop"  error you posted.

Error:vlan2251:bridge RX looped packet-MAC e4:8d:8c:3a:x:x->ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff ETHERTYPE0x0806
```

Try to set MAC of bridge manually ... to MAC different than any of bridge ports. For ideas about proper MAC address "invention", have a look atUniversal vs. local (U/L bit)section ofMAC addresswikipedia article (use MAC address of one of bridge ports as a basis and apply the L bit to it).My bridge has MAC from ether1 which I disabled and the management vlan on bridge also has same MAC but upon disabling the ether1 port, bridge didn't change its MAC and neither I loose the access to my device. So, is there any chance that the bridge changes its MAC in the future and better to take precautions to avoid any access issues ?The reason why i disabled the ether1 port is because I occasionally loose access to my all devices on management vlan 2251 for about few second and sometimes about 10-15 seconds and I suspect this occurs whenever the ether1 port changes its STP states frequently on the mikrotik switch under discussionSince firmware upgradation I haven't received any loop packets message in this device but my DHCP router for all network management vlans is also a mikrotik and I see loop broadcast message for this management vlan repeatedly at different intervals.Code:Select all
