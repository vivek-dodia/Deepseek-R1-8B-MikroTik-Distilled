It is not easy/straightforward, and there are limitations.For ARM devices there is a "better" solution through a container:viewtopic.php?t=193785the same thread contains some hints towards the possibility of using /interface/ppp-client/at-chat:viewtopic.php?t=193785#p1043120But it has to be seen how it works in practice on the Knot.Check also:viewtopic.php?t=207137https://wiki.mikrotik.com/Sending_text_ ... erial_portviewtopic.php?t=168644 ---
