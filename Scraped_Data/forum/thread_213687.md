Hi everyone, does anyone have any experience with the Cube Pro over 2.4km? I need to make a 1gbps link at 2.8km and I would like to understand if I should use or discard the product

Use Tachyon Networks or Ubiquiti Wave 60GHz. Cube's won't do that distance.

Ubiquiti AF60LR will get you 2Gbps aggregate (1Gbps "full duplex"), and Wave LR will get you 1500Mbps aggregate (up to 1Gbps each way and 500 the other, or 700-800ish both ways simultaneously).  Wave LR has a backup 5GHz radio in case of rain fade, although at that distance both radios should be pretty solid.
