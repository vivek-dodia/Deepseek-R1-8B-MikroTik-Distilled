Hello everyone. I'm new to these forums and will try not to make a fool of myself.I registered here after experiencing an issue following the upgrade to 7.15. I had recently managed to get a working dot1x setup using freeradius. I have several Mikrotik switches connecting to it using radsec. Today, I upgraded one of these switches, aCRS312-4C+8XG, to 7.15, which broke something in the communication. The TLS handshake works as normal, then the initial Access-Request is sent and received by freeradius. And no matter which response is sent in return, the switch is not apparently seeing it.I have temporarily fixed this by downgrading to an unsecured connection. Since I didn't see anyone reporting a similar issue, I figured I should write about it, in case it affects other people.Some relevant bits of my configuration:Code:Select all# 2024-06-02 20:37:52 by RouterOS 7.15# software id = H9BC-RUMQ## model = CRS312-4C+8XG/radiusaddaddress=192.168.0.1certificate=radius_client protocol=radsecrequire-message-auth=noservice=wireless,dot1x timeout=10s/interfacedot1x serveraddauth-types=dot1x,mac-authinterface=dot1x radius-mac-format=XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX/interfacelistaddname=dot1x/interfacelist memberaddinterface=ether4 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether5 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether6 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether7 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether3 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether2 list=dot1xaddinterface=combo1 list=dot1xaddinterface=combo2 list=dot1xaddinterface=combo3 list=dot1xaddinterface=combo4 list=dot1xaddinterface=ether8 list=dot1xSome relevant bit of logCode:Select all17:12:10dot1x,packet s ether3 rx EAPOL-Start17:12:10dot1x,packet s ether3 tx EAPOL-PacketEAP-Requestid:0method:IDENTITY17:12:10radius,debugnewrequest82:09code=Access-Requestservice=dot1x called-id=12-34-56-78-90-AB17:12:10radius,debug sending82:09to192.168.0.1:208317:12:10radius,debug,packet sendingAccess-Requestwithid2to192.168.0.1:208317:12:10radius,debug,packetSignature=*************17:12:10radius,debug,packetFramed-MTU=140017:12:10radius,debug,packet     NAS-Port-Type=1517:12:10radius,debug,packetCalled-Station-Id="12-34-56-78-90-AB"17:12:10radius,debug,packetCalling-Station-Id="FE-DC-BA-09-87-65"17:12:10radius,debug,packetService-Type=217:12:10radius,debug,packet     EAP-Message=0x0200000a01766172646917:12:10radius,debug,packetUser-Name="host"17:12:10radius,debug,packetAcct-Session-Id="86300003"17:12:10radius,debug,packet     NAS-Port-Id="ether3"17:12:10radius,debug,packetUnknown-Attribute(type=102)=0x0017:12:10radius,debug,packet     NAS-Identifier="nas"17:12:10radius,debug,packet     NAS-IP-Address=192.168.0.217:12:10radius,debug,packetMessage-Authenticator=************17:12:10dot1x,packet s ether3 rx EAPOL-PacketEAP-Responseid:0method:IDENTITY17:12:20radius,debug timeoutfor82:09Configuration and logs have been redacted.

Hi,I can confirm that it is broken. Spent couple of hours troubleshooting the AP that was not getting the replies from RadSec server, claiming that the server timed out, when I saw the access-accept in the server logs every time; until I have stumbled accross your post.Not the first time something gets broken in the new version ...MikroTik, cmon, get your Â£$@% together !Downgrade to 7.14.3 solves the issue - RadSec works again.C.

I have the same issue with the Hotspot using Radius on 7.15.I've confirmed via Wireshark that 'Access-Accept' packets are being received by the Mikrotik, yet the 'Accepts' on the Mikrotik shows 0 (and the Hotspot doesn't auth users).example_of_hotspot_radius_fail.png

it is kind of disturbing that things break in areas not related to changelog. this somehow reduces my trust in ROS changelog. It is rather a fairy book

Thats not good.I'm writing a custom radius server program at the moment, and using MT as my test tool.Lets hope that gets sorted

In fairness I think this is the first ever issue I've had with Hotspot Radius in 10+ years of using Mikrotiks.

In my case this actually turned out to be a user error (on my part).I'd failed to see these lines in the release note:) radius - added "require-message-auth" option that requires "Message-Authenticator" in received Access-Accept/Challenge/Reject messages;) radius - include "Message-Authenticator" in any RADIUS communication messages besides accounting for all services;...setting 'require-message-auth = no' resolved the issue (for me).I can see this is not the same issue as the OP was having (as they've already set that attribute).

I can also confirm that radsec is completely unusable in 7.15. This occurs regardless of the "require-message-auth" setting.RouterOS reports a RADIUS timeout when radsec is enabled, leading me to believe that the code enforcing the presence of a message authenticator returns a DROP decision forallreceived radsec replies.Going back to udp with shared secrets solves the issue for now, but it's obviously far less secure.Please fix this!

Given this newBlast radiusvulnerability, it would be really nice to have radsec working...

I submitted a ticket to Mikrotik support on June 6th regarding this issue (SUP-155235). It is still in the WAITING FOR SUPPORT status and has had no comment. Rather surprising to have such a significant infrastructure and security feature go un-addressed this long, especially with two subsequent minor releases.

Just as an update, I can confirm this regression is still present in RouterOS 7.17-beta4.Iopened a support ticketas well, which has received no activity.

I too dropped in a case on this (still waiting to hear back 2 weeks later).On Freeradius side, I see the first access-callenge go unanswered:Code:Select allradiusd:60366:1736548197.362852:FriJan1014:29:572025:FriJan1014:29:572025:Debug:(6)SentAccess-ChallengeId16from0.0.0.0:2083to172.18.96.1:49559length64radiusd:60366:1736548197.362875:FriJan1014:29:572025:FriJan1014:29:572025:Debug:(6)EAP-Message=0x010200061920radiusd:60366:1736548197.362897:FriJan1014:29:572025:FriJan1014:29:572025:Debug:(6)Message-Authenticator=0x00000000000000000000000000000000radiusd:60366:1736548197.362920:FriJan1014:29:572025:FriJan1014:29:572025:Debug:(6)State=0x05b269d605b070e56f176b1c6a5cb5cbAfter configured timeout is reached on Mikrotik side, the eapol session terminates due to timeout.If I test with Cisco/Meraki/Ubiquiti/Ruckus radsec works with existing freeradius config without issues as expected.  I also did confirm reverting to 7.14 radsec seems to work again.Toggling the require-message-auth configuration has no effect.

Trouble with RADIUS in Mikrotik using TekRADIUS.My configuration has been working well for over a decade, but upgrading beyond 7.14.3 breaks the implementation.A RADIUS reply that simply provides authorization works...  However, RADIUS replies that have a FRAMED-IP-ADDRESS or a ROUTE attached to the username, fails against the server.  I've selected "Require Message Auth: NO" - and it does not solve the matter.  Unfortunately,  I was unable to obtain any wireshark captures as this was on a production network and I had to revert to 7.14.3.   I have tried 7.15 and 7.16.2 - I've avoided 7.17 as I had some trouble with winbox with this release.Has anyone had any luck in resolving?
