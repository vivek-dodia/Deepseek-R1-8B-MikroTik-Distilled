Hello,I'm trying to configure my network as in the image bellow, but I am unable to configure the port from ether1 to forward traffic to port ether3.So basically i would like ether3 to become a hybrid port to receive all the traffic from ether1 and to sent back traffic from other vlans.I have been able to configure tagged traffic using thehelp mikrotik docsCan anyone please help me with this situation ?

Looks doable, post your config and this will help.

Here is my configCode:Select all# 1970-01-02 00:07:12 by RouterOS 7.11.2# software id = IEFQ-RNUW## model = RB760iGS/interfacebridgeaddname=BR1 protocol-mode=none vlan-filtering=yes/interfaceethernetset[finddefault-name=ether2]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether4]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=sfp1]disabled=yes/interfacevlanaddinterface=BR1 name=MGMT_VLAN vlan-id=18/interfacewireless security-profilesset[finddefault=yes]supplicant-identity=MikroTik/ip hotspot profileset[finddefault=yes]html-directory=hotspot/portset0name=serial0/interfacebridge portaddbridge=BR1 frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-taggedinterface=\

I have asked my ISP if they see any attempt for me to connect and they told me basically there are NO attempts which means the traffic it's not reaching the ISP.So i'm stuck at the level that whatever i'm getting on port ether1 it's not getting passed over to port ether3 using VLANS

Before fixing the config,Is the ISP giving you two WANIPs ???WHY the second router doing pppoe. ( why do you need it, all could be done via hex for example )Is the hex acting as a switch or router?I am thinking without a proper understanding of the setup and your intent, this could be a chasing game.So only one device connected to pppoe router?

Before fixing the config,Is the ISP giving you two WANIPs ???A: I'm getting only one Public IP on the WAN Interface, but when i'm connected i'm getting a tunnel private ip and the Public IP!WHY the second router doing pppoe. ( why do you need it, all could be done via hex for example )A: Because i want to use my hex as a switch and to pass all the traffic to my other router which will handle the PPPOE connection, firewall-ing and all the additional stuffIs the hex acting as a switch or router?A: My hex it's acting as a switch and the reason behind it is because of the way my physical cabling and where i have the equipment all around my house. So i am not able to pass other cables and i don't have another network port available on the 2nd router. So i decided the best way to achieve my goal is to use VLAN'sI am thinking without a proper understanding of the setup and your intent, this could be a chasing game.So only one device connected to pppoe router?A: there are many other devices connected behind the 2nd router which should be connected to the PPPOEthe topology is simple :ISP -> [ether1]HEX (acting as a switch) -> [ether3] 2nd router (pppoe connection) -> my internal devices behind the firewal/routerAlso then on port ether5 will be an access point which should receive tagged traffic for the LAN as in my picture above.Please do let me know if I haven't been clear enough.Like i said, the hex I want to be used as a managed switch with vlans only.

Remove serial number from your posted config!!Ether3 has to be a trunk port carrying all vlans between hex switch and Router.Ether1 and Ether5 are access ports, untagged as required when leaving the port.I dont understand this nomenclatureadd address=10.87.2.28/28interface=MGMT_VLAN network=10.87.2.16I think the .16 should be .0 and the subnet mask is fine if you really only wanted 14 usable IP addresses!!If you wanted to keep your setup as is, .....close to what you have now.......# model = RB760iGS/interface bridgeadd name=BR1 protocol-mode=none vlan-filtering=yes/interface ethernetset [ find default-name=ether2 ] disabled=yesset [ find default-name=sfp1 ] disabled=yes/interface vlanadd interface=BR1 name=MGMT_VLAN vlan-id=18/interface listadd name=TRUSTED/interface bridge portadd bridge=BR1ingress-filtering=yesframe-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=ether1 pvid=187 comment="internet from isp"add bridge=BR1ingress-filtering=yesframe-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=ether5 pvid=18add bridge=BRingress-filtering=yes frame-type=admit-only-vlan-taggedinterface=ether3 comment="trunk port to router"/ip neighbor discovery-settingsset discover-interface-list=TRUSTED/interface bridge vlan   { untagged entries not required, but I put them in manually so visible on printed export }add bridge=BR1 tagged=BR1,ether3untagged=ether5vlan-ids=18comment="trusted LAN subnet"add bridge=BR1 tagged=ether3untagged=ether1vlan-ids=187comment="vlan for carrying internet"/interface list memberadd interface=MGMT_VLAN  list=TRUSTED/ip addressadd address=10.87.2.28/28 interface=MGMT_VLAN network=10.87.2.0/ip routeadd distance=1 gateway=10.87.2.30/system identityset name=SwitchHybrid/system noteset show-at-login=no/ip dnsset server=10.87.2.30/tool mac-serverset allowed-interface-list=none/tool mac-server mac-winboxset allowed-interface-list=TRUSTED+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Personally I would actually have a management VLAN and an off bridge port for for actual vlan configurating from a safe spot on both MT devices......Management vlan is not the normal LAN subnet you are using for all users.........keep management separated.Would look like.Changes ingreenfrom your config for easy comparison.# model = RB760iGS/interface bridgeadd name=BR1 protocol-mode=none vlan-filtering=yes/interface ethernetset [ find default-name=ether2 ] disabled=yesset [ find default-name=sfp1 ] disabled=yesset [ find default-name=ether4 ]name=OffBridge4/interface vlanadd interface=BR1 name=MGMT_VLAN vlan-id=99/interface listadd name=TRUSTED/interface bridge portadd bridge=BR1 ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=ether1 pvid=187 comment="internet from isp"add bridge=BR1 ingress-filtering=yes frame-types=admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged interface=ether5 pvid=18add bridge=BR ingress-filtering=yes frame-type=admit-only-vlan-tagged interface=ether3 comment="trunk port to router"/ip neighbor discovery-settingsset discover-interface-list=TRUSTED/interface bridge vlanadd bridge=BR1 tagged=ether3  untagged=ether5  vlan-ids=18comment="normal LAN subnet"add bridge=BR1 tagged=ether3  untagged=ether1  vlan-ids=187comment="vlan for carrying internet"add bridge=BR1 tagged=BR1,ether3, vlan-ids=99comment="management subnet"/interface list memberadd interface=MGMT_VLAN  list=TRUSTEDadd interface=OffBridge4 list=TRUSTED/ip addressadd address=192.168.99.2/30 interface=MGMT_VLAN  network=192.168.99.0{ increase subnet size if have additional smart devices }add address=192.168.44.1/30  interface=OffBridge4 network=192.168.44.0/ip routeadd distance=1 gateway=192.168.99.1/system identityset name=SwitchHybrid/system noteset show-at-login=no/ip dnsset server=192.168.99.1/tool mac-serverset allowed-interface-list=none/tool mac-server mac-winboxset allowed-interface-list=TRUSTEDNote: make changes for ether4 first, then one can plug in laptop to either4, change IPV4 settings to 192.168.44.2  and you should be in and working.

add bridge=BR1 interface=ether3 pvid=187 -if I add this admit-only-vlan-tagged i'm losing access to the other VLAN'stry setting the PVID to 1 (or 4094 when not used otherwise) --> 187 coming in tagged and also PVID set to that VLAN ID does not go well in ROS ... still

What do you mean exactly??ETher1 is simply capturing the internet traffic stuffing the untagged traffic into vlan187 through the hex and bringing it to your router to be terminated as vlan187 traffic.VLAN 18 is your managment subnet and also your main subnet.The hex gets its address from here.You should be able to access the hex for managment purposes via winbox from any vlan18 device.At your generic router coming from ether3 on the hex are two VLANs,  187 which should be terminated on the pppoe router and vlan18 which should be handled appropriately.Its not our problem that you havent identified said router or what its capable of doing,Perhaps its the wrong type of device for this setup.Also final point your comment makes zero sense, there are no other vlans to access.......................+++++++++++++++confirm, the ISP device provides untagged traffic to the hex  ( not already tagged with 187)a.  if its not tagged, no changes requiredb. if its already tagged then ether1 becomes a trunk port and you would need to modify /interface bridge vlan to show tagged on ether1 and ether3 for 187confirm the pppoe router can accepteithera.  tagged vlans for both main vlan and internet vlanORb.  tagged vlan for main vlan and untagged traffic.ORc.  untagged traffic for main vlan and tagged vlan for internet.If none of the above, then its time to ditch the router and let the hex do it all.
