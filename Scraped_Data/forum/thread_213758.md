We need to see the current IPv6 config: `/ipv6/export`

Ah, apologies. Thanks for highlighting this.Configuration is as follows:Code:Select allSetting use-peer-dns=no to yes does not make a difference in the current configuration.

I don't know if that would fix the problem, but:don't create IPv6 pool manually. DHCPv6 client will create it automatically after it receives prefix.don't useprefix-length=48(either set it to 64 or omit it altogether), it doesn't do what you probabky think it does. It's about prefix length when they are handed out: either to DHCPv6 server if your router is set up to pass prefixes further) or when assigning ipv6 address using syntaxaddress=::1 from-pool=<pool name>.If you want to indicate desired prefix size to upstream DHCPv6 server, you can setprefix-hint=::/48property of DHCPv6 client (but it's a hint and upstream DHCPv6 server is likely to ignore it).It could be that your ISP is handing out smaller (longer) prefixes than /48 (mine is giving /56, some are giving /60 and some brain-dead ISPs are giving /64) and since your setting says you'll be using /48 prefixes, any received prefix smaller than /48 might be ignored by DHCPv6 client.Also: settingadd-default-route=yesis conceptually wrong, but it might work with some ISPs. What this option does is that it takes DHCPv6 server's (link-local) address and uses it as upstream gateway in default IPv6 route. This works fine if DHVPv6 server is a router as well (either actually intended one or just happpens to support routing), but thr correct way would be to tisable this property and set/ipv6/settings/set accept-router-advertisements: yes(default is effectively "no" while ideally that would be enabled per interface).But the setting, discussed in previous paragraph, doesn't prevent your DHCPv6 client from obtaining prefix.

Thank you for your guidance.I have gone ahead and deleted my manually created pool.When trying to enable accept router advertisements, I get an error like so:Code:Select allAdditionally, the DHCPv6 client isn't happy when I try to specify no pool, or a blank prefix. (When I set it to /64, it gets stuck in the "searching..." state again - my ISP has assured me they are assigning /48s in this case)Is this an issue with WinBox, the router, or my understanding?

Code:Select allSorry, it should beCode:Select allIf it doesn't allow you to unset prefix-length, then set it to 64.You can omit requesting address ... it's not always needed and some DHCP servers might have problems providing both in response to single request.Are you using winbox4? I'm not closely following its development, but it might still have some teething problems here and there. So you can try using webfig (web UI) or CLI to verify that DHCPv6 client settings are indeed as intended.

Is it feasible to disable all IPv6 firewall rules, reboot the router and then attach the output of `/ipv6/pool/print`?

you use pppoe????problably is pppoe that provide you the IP connectivity, not the dhcp on ether1...I can fail on this because I do not understand correctly how you have setup yout router...The first user that reply you on this topic must ask first how is configured and attached your router...put/ip route prion terminal and post results on forum, obfuscating (not removing) real IPs (not the 192.x, 10.x, 172.x obviously....)

Unfortunately it doesn't look like my ISP will actually be much help in getting this sorted as they're taking the "it's a third-party router, not our responsibility" route.If that is their way of dealing with this THEN i suspect they are using a Mac Addy or Serial number lock on your account  .... so then you should TRY the spoofing solution I mentiomed earlier:Find out the Mac Addy of their provided Router and Serial number then on your TIK change the Mac Addy of your Tik ether1 port to their Routers Mac Addy and see if that solves the problem  --  I suggest that you use the ipv6 Config I provided you earlier ...Make sure to record the default Mac addy for the port [ether1] you want to make changes on in case you have to revert backIn teminal issue the following directive:/interface ethernet set ether1 mac-address=xxxIf that does not work then you may try one other method.The cryptic wall box [ONT] -- How does your Tik router connect to the ONT? is it via ethernet cable or SFP moduleWhat brand is the ONT ?

So I'm now trying to receive a prefix via RA.I have a single Ipv6 address being received via DHCPv6 and believe I have my Mikrotik configured correctly to receive RAs.In my log, I see some activity on the ether1 interface.Code:Select allHowever it never progresses any further than receiving some kind of RA from that bogon address, no prefix, no address, nothing else. I find it weird that my ISP has a bogon address on their end, which makes me believe that I may not be actually talking to their upstream router, but that the ONT may be more intelligent than it has to be.Unfortunately, my ISP is still of the opinion that as long as I have RA enabled, it should work. I'm bouncing back to them yet again for an update on this one, but I'm not holding my breath.My current IPv6 config:Code:Select all

You may have to add options to your logging rule to see detailed information - typicallydebug, and if there is too much output!packetcan be useful too.The address looks fine - IPv6 uses link-local addresses in many places, rather than global unique addresses.Unfortunately the IPv6 standards allow for various methods of providing and configuring addresses, the most common is Router Advertisments to provide the ISP - customer WAN prefix with the customer WAN address being formed from this prefix plus the WAN interface MAC address, additionally DHCPv6 prefix delegation to obtain addresses for the customer LAN(s).Just having/ipv6 settingsset accept-router-advertisements=yesshould be sufficient for IPv6 connectivity from the Mikrotik itself, then/ipv6 dhcp-clientadd interface=ether1 pool-name=litv6 request=prefixshould request the delegated addresses.I've never seen an ISP trying to provide the delegated prefix in Router Advertisments, I'm not convinced the standards have a mechanism to do so.
