```
{
:local test "2024-06-28 01:30:11"
:local findfrom       -1                             ; # -1 mean "from the start"
:local spaceposition  [:find $test " " $findfrom]    ; # find inside the string the character [SPACE] from the start
:local dstartposition 0                              ; # the date start at the begin of the string
:local   dendposition  $spaceposition                ; # the date end before the [SPACE] position
:local tstartposition ($spaceposition + 1)           ; # the time start after [SPACE] position
:local   tendposition [:len $test]                   ; # the time end at the last character of the string
:local d [:pick $test $dstartposition $dendposition] ; # pick the date
:local t [:pick $test $tstartposition $tendposition] ; # pick the time
:put "Date is >$d< and Time is >$t<"
}
```

```
{
:local test "2024-06-28 01:30:11"
:local d [:pick $test 0 10]
:local t [:pick $test 11 19]
:put ">$d<"
:put ">$t<"
}
```

Do not use useless ; and put everytime the : on :local and :putNo matter if is only one examle. Bad habit stay on all little things.Code:Select allSince the format have everytime the same lenght and position, can be simplified with static lenght and position:Code:Select all
