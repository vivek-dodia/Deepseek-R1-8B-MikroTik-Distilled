# MikroTik RouterOS VLAN Configuration for SOHO Environments (v6.x)

**Documentation for MikroTik Certified Engineers**

**Topic:** Virtual LANs (VLANs)
**RouterOS Version:** 6.x
**Network Scale:** Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)
**Complexity Level:** Basic

## 1. Architecture Diagram Requirements

A VLAN (Virtual LAN) logically separates a physical network into multiple broadcast domains. In a SOHO environment, VLANs can enhance security and network organization by isolating different types of traffic, such as guest networks, internal networks, and IoT devices.

**Diagram Explanation:**

*   **Internet:** Represents the external network.
*   **MikroTik Router:** The central device managing network traffic and VLAN segregation.
    *   **WAN Interface (ether1):** Connects to the internet.
    *   **Bridge Interface (bridge1):**  Acts as a virtual switch, handling traffic between VLANs and physical ports.
    *   **VLAN 10 (vlan10):**  Represents the internal network VLAN.
    *   **VLAN 20 (vlan20):** Represents the guest network VLAN.
*   **Internal Network (VLAN 10):** Devices intended for private use, like PCs and printers.
*   **Guest Network (VLAN 20):** Devices for guest users, providing internet access but isolated from the internal network.

## 2. CLI Configuration with Inline Comments

This section provides CLI commands to configure VLANs on a MikroTik router. We will create two VLANs: VLAN 10 for the internal network and VLAN 20 for the guest network.  We will use `ether2` and `ether3` as physical ports assigned to these VLANs, bridged together.

```routeros

## 3. REST API Implementation (Python Code)

This Python script uses the `requests` library to configure VLANs via the MikroTik RouterOS REST API. Ensure the REST API service is enabled on your MikroTik router (`/ip service enable api`).  Replace `<router_ip>`, `<api_user>`, and `<api_password>` with your router's IP address and API credentials.

```python
import requests

router_ip = "192.168.88.1" # Replace with your router's IP
api_user = "api_user"      # Replace with your API username
api_password = "api_password" # Replace with your API password

base_url = f"http://{router_ip}/rest" # Consider HTTPS for production

headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

def api_request(method, path, data=None):
    try:
        response = requests.request(method, f"{base_url}{path}", json=data, auth=(api_user, api_password), headers=headers, verify=False) # verify=False for self-signed certs in testing
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return response.json() if response.text else None
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"API Request Error: {e}")
        if response is not None:
            print(f"Response Status Code: {response.status_code}")
            print(f"Response Text: {response.text}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    configure_vlan()
    print("VLAN configuration applied successfully via API.")
```

**Python Script Explanation:**

*   **`api_request(method, path, data=None)` function:**  Handles sending API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Includes basic error handling for HTTP requests.
*   **`configure_vlan()` function:** Contains a series of `api_request` calls to configure different aspects of VLANs, mirroring the CLI configuration.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block in `api_request` catches potential network errors and HTTP errors from the API.  It prints error messages and response details for debugging.
*   **Security Note:** The `verify=False` in `requests.request` disables SSL certificate verification, which is **not recommended for production environments**. For production, use HTTPS and handle certificate verification properly or use a trusted certificate.

## 4. Common Debugging Scenarios

When setting up VLANs, you might encounter these common issues:

| Scenario                     | Possible Cause(s)                                  | Debugging Steps                                                                                               | RouterOS Tools                       |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **No internet access in VLAN** | - Incorrect VLAN ID                                 | - Verify VLAN ID configuration on router and switches (if any). - Check IP address, gateway, and DNS settings. | `/interface vlan print`, `/ip address print`, `/ip route print`, `ping` |
|                              | - Firewall blocking traffic                         | - Check firewall rules, ensure NAT is configured correctly for the VLAN subnet.                                 | `/ip firewall filter print`, `/ip firewall nat print` |
|                              | - DHCP server not configured or not working         | - Verify DHCP server is enabled and configured for the VLAN interface. - Check DHCP leases.                      | `/ip dhcp-server print`, `/ip dhcp-server lease print` |
| **Devices in VLAN cannot communicate** | - VLAN isolation firewall rules too restrictive | - Review firewall rules between VLANs. Ensure necessary inter-VLAN traffic is allowed if intended.         | `/ip firewall filter print`           |
|                              | - Incorrect bridge port configuration               | - Check bridge port settings, especially PVID and VLAN tagging settings.                                     | `/interface bridge port print`        |
| **VLAN tagging issues**      | - Mismatched VLAN IDs between devices                | - Double-check VLAN IDs on all involved devices (routers, switches, endpoints).                               | `packet sniffer`, `torch`              |
|                              | - Incorrect tagging/untagging on ports              | - Verify port VLAN configuration (PVID, VLAN IDs) on routers and switches.                                    | `/interface bridge port print`        |

**Example Debugging using RouterOS Tools:**

1.  **Ping:** Use `/ping <destination_ip> interface=<vlan_interface>` to test connectivity from the router to devices in the VLAN or to the internet via the VLAN interface.
2.  **Traceroute:** Use `/traceroute <destination_ip> interface=<vlan_interface>` to trace the path packets take, helping identify routing issues.
3.  **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=<vlan_interface>` to monitor real-time traffic on the VLAN interface, useful for verifying traffic flow and identifying protocol issues.
4.  **Packet Sniffer:** Use `/tool sniffer interface=<physical_interface> filter-vlan-id=<vlan_id>` to capture and analyze packets on the physical interface related to a specific VLAN ID, helpful for diagnosing tagging and protocol problems.

## 5. Version-Specific Considerations (RouterOS v6.x)

*   **Bridge VLAN Filtering (v6.x vs v7+):** In RouterOS v6.x, VLAN filtering on bridges is less feature-rich compared to v7+.  VLAN tagging/untagging is primarily handled via PVID and VLAN IDs on bridge ports.  VLAN filtering in v6.x is generally disabled by default on bridges. For more advanced VLAN filtering features, consider upgrading to RouterOS v7 or later.
*   **Hardware Offloading Limitations:** Hardware offloading for bridging and VLANs might have limitations in v6.x depending on the specific RouterBOARD model. Check the RouterBOARD's documentation for hardware offloading capabilities.
*   **STP/RSTP:** If using a bridge with multiple ports and potentially creating loops (e.g., with switches), ensure Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid STP (RSTP) is enabled on the bridge (`/interface bridge set bridge1 protocol-mode=rstp`) to prevent network loops and broadcast storms.

## 6. Security Hardening Measures

For VLANs in a SOHO environment, consider these security measures:

*   **VLAN Isolation Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to strictly control traffic between VLANs. In our example, we blocked Guest VLAN (VLAN 20) from accessing the Internal VLAN (VLAN 10). Customize these rules based on your specific needs.
*   **DHCP Snooping (Limited in v6.x on Bridges without VLAN Filtering enabled):** While full DHCP snooping as in enterprise switches might be limited on RouterOS v6.x bridges without VLAN filtering, ensure that DHCP servers are only running on the intended VLAN interfaces and not accidentally leaking to other VLANs.  In v7+, bridge VLAN filtering offers more robust DHCP snooping capabilities.
*   **Prevent VLAN Hopping (Mitigated by VLAN Isolation Rules):** The firewall rules that prevent inter-VLAN routing effectively mitigate basic VLAN hopping attempts. Ensure strong firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access between VLANs.
*   **Strong Wi-Fi Security (if using VLANs with Wi-Fi):** If guest VLAN is used for Wi-Fi, use WPA2/WPA3-Personal with a strong passphrase. Consider using separate SSIDs for different VLANs to clearly differentiate networks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review firewall rules, access policies, and router configurations to ensure ongoing security.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any RouterOS services that are not required (e.g., unused APIs, Telnet, FTP) to reduce the attack surface.

## 7. Performance Optimization Tips

*   **Hardware Offloading (Check RouterBOARD Support):** Enable hardware offloading for bridging and VLANs if supported by your RouterBOARD model (`/interface bridge set bridge1 hw=yes`). This can significantly improve performance, especially for higher traffic loads.
*   **FastTrack Firewall (Use with Caution):** FastTrack can accelerate established connections, but it bypasses some firewall features. Use FastTrack cautiously and ensure it doesn't compromise VLAN isolation rules. Generally, for security-focused VLAN setups, it's safer to avoid aggressive FastTrack rules that might bypass important checks.
*   **Efficient Firewall Rules:** Optimize firewall rule order and specificity. Place frequently matched rules higher in the list. Use efficient rule criteria (e.g., connection state) to reduce processing overhead.
*   **Limit Broadcast Domains:** VLANs themselves help limit broadcast domains. Avoid overly large VLANs in very dense SOHO environments; consider further subnetting if necessary.
*   **Regular RouterOS Updates:** Keep your RouterOS version updated to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes in newer releases. However, always test updates in a non-production environment first.

## Special Requirements for SOHO Environments

### Real-World Deployment Examples

1.  **Guest Wi-Fi Network:**  Isolate guest wireless users onto VLAN 20, providing internet access but preventing them from accessing internal network resources (file servers, printers, internal PCs on VLAN 10). This is the example we configured.
2.  **IoT Device Segregation:** Place IoT devices (smart home devices, cameras) on a separate VLAN (e.g., VLAN 30). This enhances security by limiting the potential impact if an IoT device is compromised.  IoT VLAN can have restricted internet access and no access to the internal network.
3.  **Voice VLAN:** In a small office with VoIP phones, a dedicated VLAN (e.g., VLAN 40) can prioritize voice traffic for better call quality. QoS (Quality of Service) rules can be applied to prioritize traffic on the Voice VLAN.

### Scalability Considerations

For basic SOHO VLAN setups like guest and internal networks, the described configuration is generally scalable for typical SOHO device counts (e.g., up to a few dozen devices per VLAN).

**Scalability Limits in SOHO:**

*   **Router Processing Power:**  Very high device counts and complex firewall rules might strain the router's CPU, especially on lower-end RouterBOARD models.
*   **Switch Port Density:** If you need to connect many VLAN-aware devices via wired connections, you might need VLAN-capable switches with sufficient port density.
*   **Wireless Capacity:**  If VLANs are used for Wi-Fi, the wireless access point's capacity and the number of concurrent wireless clients become limiting factors. Consider dedicated VLAN-aware access points for higher density deployments.

**When VLANs Might Become Insufficient in SOHO:**

*   **Extremely Large SOHO Networks:** For very large homes or small offices with hundreds of devices, more advanced network segmentation techniques beyond basic VLANs might be needed (e.g., VRF-Lite in more advanced RouterOS configurations or moving to more enterprise-grade networking equipment).
*   **Complex Multi-Tenant SOHO/Small Business:** If you have a SOHO environment with multiple distinct tenants or businesses sharing the same physical network, more sophisticated isolation and security measures than simple VLANs might be required.

### Monitoring Configurations

*   **Interface Monitoring:** Monitor VLAN interfaces (`vlan10`, `vlan20`) using RouterOS built-in monitoring tools (`/interface monitor-traffic`) or via SNMP to a network monitoring system (e.g., The Dude, Zabbix). Monitor interface traffic, packet loss, and errors.
*   **DHCP Lease Monitoring:** Check DHCP leases (`/ip dhcp-server lease print`) to track devices connected to each VLAN.
*   **Firewall Rule Counters:** Monitor firewall rule counters (`/ip firewall filter stats print`) to verify that VLAN isolation rules are working as expected and to identify potential traffic patterns or anomalies.
*   **Simple Logging:** Enable basic logging for dropped firewall packets (`/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop log=yes log-prefix="VLAN-Drop" ...`) to get basic insights into blocked traffic. For more detailed logging, consider using RouterOS's logging features to send logs to a syslog server.
*   **The Dude (MikroTik's Network Management Tool):** For a visual monitoring solution, use The Dude to map your network, monitor device status, interface traffic, and set up alerts for network issues.

### Disaster Recovery Steps

1.  **Regular Backups:** Implement automated configuration backups (see automated backup script below). Store backups securely off-router.
2.  **Safe Mode:** If you make a configuration change that breaks network access, reboot the MikroTik router into Safe Mode. Safe Mode disables the last saved configuration, allowing you to revert changes and troubleshoot. To enter Safe Mode, hold the reset button during boot until the RouterBOARD starts beeping.
3.  **Configuration Restore:** If a configuration is corrupted or lost, restore from a recent backup using RouterOS's import/export or backup/restore features (`/system backup load name=<backup_file.backup>`).
4.  **Document Configuration:** Keep a written or electronic record of your VLAN setup, IP addressing schemes, and firewall rules. This documentation will be invaluable during troubleshooting and disaster recovery.
5.  **Test Recovery Procedures:** Periodically test your backup and restore procedures to ensure they work as expected and that you are familiar with the recovery process.

### Automated Backup Scripts

This RouterOS script automates configuration backups and saves them to the router's flash storage with timestamps. You can schedule this script to run regularly using the RouterOS scheduler (`/system scheduler`).

```routeros
# --- Backup Script ---
:local backupName ("vlan_config_backup_" . [:system date format="%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"])
/system backup save name=$backupName dont-encrypt=yes
:log info "Automated VLAN configuration backup created: $backupName"

# --- Example Scheduler Configuration (run daily at 3:00 AM) ---
/system scheduler
add name="Daily VLAN Backup" interval=1d start-time=03:00:00 on-event="/system script run VLAN_Backup_Script" policy=ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sensitive,romon

# --- Create the script itself ---
/system script
add name="VLAN_Backup_Script" source={
    # --- Backup Script Code from above goes here ---
    :local backupName ("vlan_config_backup_" . [:system date format="%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"])
    /system backup save name=$backupName dont-encrypt=yes
    :log info "Automated VLAN configuration backup created: $backupName"
}
```

**Script Explanation:**

*   **`:local backupName ...`:** Generates a unique backup filename using the current date and time.
*   **`/system backup save name=$backupName dont-encrypt=yes`:** Creates a RouterOS backup file with the generated name. `dont-encrypt=yes` is used for simplicity in SOHO, but consider encryption for sensitive environments.
*   **`:log info ...`:** Logs a message indicating that the backup was created.
*   **Scheduler Configuration:** The example scheduler entry shows how to run the `VLAN_Backup_Script` daily at 3:00 AM. Adjust the `interval` and `start-time` as needed.

**Important Note:**  For enhanced security, consider storing backups off-router on a network share (using FTP, SFTP, or SCP) or using RouterOS's backup encryption features.

This comprehensive documentation provides a detailed guide for setting up VLANs in a SOHO MikroTik RouterOS environment, covering configuration, debugging, security, performance, and SOHO-specific considerations. Remember to adapt the configuration and security measures to your specific network requirements.
