Okay, let's dive deep into this comprehensive MikroTik configuration for a point-to-point link scenario, targeting RouterOS 7.11 (and also considering 6.48 & other 7.x versions). This will be an expert-level guide, covering the specified topics with practical examples and explanations.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** We are configuring a direct point-to-point wireless link between two MikroTik routers. One router will act as the "primary" end of the link, and the other will act as the "secondary" end. We need to configure IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, along with various other features to ensure a robust and secure connection.
*   **Specific Requirements:**
    *   **Subnet:** 48.51.131.0/24 for IPv4. We'll use `48.51.131.1/24` for the primary router's interface and `48.51.131.2/24` for the secondary's interface.
    *   **IPv6:** We will also configure a link-local IPv6 address on this interface.
    *   **Interface Name:** `wlan-59` will be the interface name for both routers. Note that `wlan-59` must be an active wireless interface configured to connect to other Mikrotik routers before any of the IP configuration is set. This setup does not cover wireless configuration, but any standard method for two wireless interfaces to connect to each other can be used.
    *   **Security:** We will implement basic firewall rules and secure access to the router.
    *   **Monitoring:** We'll utilize Mikrotik's monitoring tools.

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfalls:**
    *   **Incorrect Interface:**  Always double-check you are using the correct interface name. Typos are common. Use `interface print` to get the list of interfaces.
    *   **Firewall Blockage:** If you can't reach the router, check the firewall rules. An overly strict firewall is a very common mistake.
    *   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** Mistakes in the subnet mask will cause routing problems.
    *   **NTP Issues:** if time is not set correctly the router may have issues with SSL certificates.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Connectivity:** Use `/ping <IP address>` to test connectivity. If the ping fails, start with simple checks like making sure both IP addresses are correctly set.
    *   **Firewall:** Use `/ip firewall filter print` to review the active rules. If you cannot connect via Winbox, make sure that you have an input rule that accepts traffic on `port 8291`.
    *   **Interface Status:** `/interface print` shows interface status. Make sure the interface is enabled.
    *   **Logs:** Use `/system logging print` and `/system logging action print` to check if anything is wrong.
    *  **Neighbours:** Use `/ip neighbor print` to check if other router is discovered.
*   **Diagnostics:**
    *   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-59` to see real-time traffic. You will need to configure torch to see all traffic, by using `display-options="bytes,src-mac,dst-mac,src-address,dst-address,src-port,dst-port"`
    *   **Packet Sniffer:** Use `/tool sniffer` to capture traffic for later analysis.
    *   **Traceroute:** Use `/tool traceroute <IP address>` to follow the path of packets.
    *   **Bandwidth Test:** Use `/tool bandwidth-test` to test speed.
    *   **Graphs:** `/tool graphing print` to see interface traffic in graphs
    *   **Interface stats:** `/interface monitor wlan-59` to see interface statistics.
*   **Error Scenarios:**
    *   **Example:** If you see error logs about "invalid address", check the subnet mask, or make sure there are no IP address conflicts.
    *   **Example:** if you see `disconnected, unknown` on the interface you likely have not correctly configured the wireless interface.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps using MikroTik Tools**

1.  **Ping:**  From the primary router, execute `/ping 48.51.131.2`. From the secondary router, `/ping 48.51.131.1`. Successful pings indicate basic IP connectivity.
2.  **Traceroute:** From the primary router, execute `/tool traceroute 48.51.131.2`. This should show just one hop, indicating the direct point-to-point link.
3.  **Interface Status:**  On both routers, use `/interface print` and check that `wlan-59` is enabled, and that there are no errors or connection issues. The `R` flag should be set which means the interface is active and running.
4.  **Torch:** Use `tool torch` to monitor and verify that real traffic is flowing between the interfaces. This is useful for troubleshooting if the ping is successful but traffic is not flowing.
5.  **Winbox:** Open Winbox and connect to both the primary and secondary devices.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **Bridging:** In this simple PTP scenario, bridging isn't necessary. Bridging becomes important when connecting multiple devices to a single LAN segment.
*   **Routing:** We don't need specific routing protocols here, but in larger networks, you'd use OSPF, RIP, or BGP.
*   **Firewalling:** RouterOS's firewall is stateful and very powerful. We have just scratched the surface in this example.
*   **IP Pools:** IP pools are used for DHCP servers. We've added an example for you, if you want to configure this as DHCP server.
*   **MAC Server:** Allows MAC address connections and discovery via tools like winbox. This can be used to connect even if IP addresses are not set.
*  **RoMON:** RoMON allows access to devices using layer-2 discovery which can be used if there is an issue with layer-3 networking.
*   **Winbox:** Winbox is the native MikroTik configuration tool, which allows for easy configuration and debugging of MikroTik devices.
*  **Certificates:** Used for encrypting connections, certificates can be created for a variety of services including IPsec, OpenVPN, and more.
* **PPP AAA:** This is for authentication, authorization, and accounting for PPP connections. Useful for ISP scenarios.
*   **RADIUS:** Used for centralized authentication and accounting.
*   **User/User Groups:** RouterOS has granular user management. We've created an admin user as a basic example.
*   **Switch Chip Features:** MikroTik RouterBOARD devices that use switch chips can be used as dedicated switches. Features such as hardware offloading, VLAN and LAGS are only available on switch chips.
*   **MACVLAN:** This is a feature where a physical interface is able to host multiple virtual interfaces that each have their own MAC address, this is commonly used for containers.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:** MikroTik provides L3 hardware offloading on specific hardware platforms that use a dedicated switch chip, for the best performance this should be used.
*   **MACsec:** This is layer 2 encryption which can help secure layer 2 protocols.
*   **Quality of Service:** RouterOS's QoS system is very complex and able to create very granular shaping and prioritization. This could be useful for guaranteeing a minimum bandwidth for certain services.
*   **VLANs:** Virtual LANs can be configured on MikroTik devices for segmented networks.
*   **VXLAN:** Virtual Extensible LAN is a tunneling protocol used to extend layer 2 networks across layer 3 boundaries.
*   **IP Services:** RouterOS provides DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, and proxy services. We enabled the SSH service as part of this configuration.
*   **High Availability:** You can use VRRP or bonding for HA links.
*   **Mobile Networking:** RouterOS supports LTE/5G. This is used for cellular backup or main connections.
*   **MPLS:** MPLS is for advanced routing and traffic engineering.
*   **Network Management:** ARP, DHCP, DNS, and other protocols are well supported.
*   **Routing:** RouterOS has a wide variety of routing protocols such as BGP, OSPF, RIP and more. Policy routing and VRFs are also supported.

* **Diagnostics, monitoring and troubleshooting:** Tools for network analysis, logging, and packet capturing are supported.
* **Extended Features:** Containers, DLNA media server, SMB, and more.

**Less Common Features Scenarios:**

* **MACVLAN:** If you wanted to run multiple containers you can have each one assigned its own MAC address by adding a MACVLAN interface using the command `/interface macvlan add name=macvlan1 interface=wlan-59 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01` then you can set an IP address on that virtual interface using `/ip address add address=192.168.1.2/24 interface=macvlan1`
* **VRRP:** If you need to create a high-availability link you can set a VRRP interface that will automatically switch to the backup router if the primary router goes down. Here is an example `/interface vrrp add interface=wlan-59 vrid=1 priority=200 address=48.51.131.1/24 vrrp-v3=yes` then on the other router set it to `/interface vrrp add interface=wlan-59 vrid=1 priority=100 address=48.51.131.1/24 vrrp-v3=yes` In this example the device with a priority of 200 will be the primary router, and the other one will be the backup. In order to ensure seamless switching, set an IP address on both the interfaces using `/ip address add address=48.51.131.1/24 interface=vrrp1`

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts (MikroTik Implementation)**

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik uses bridging to create a single broadcast domain across multiple interfaces. Bridge interfaces must be created, then interfaces must be added to the bridge to be included in the bridge.
*   **Routing:** RouterOS maintains a routing table. Routes can be static or learned via dynamic routing protocols. Each interface can have its own VRF that uses its own routing table.
*   **Firewall:** MikroTik firewalls are stateful, using connection tracking to analyze and filter traffic. There are three main chains `input`, `forward`, and `output`.
    *   `input`: Used for connections destined to the router itself.
    *   `forward`: Used for packets that are being routed through the router.
    *   `output`: Used for connections that are initiated from the router itself.
    *   All the rules in a chain are traversed from the top down until a rule matches.
*   **IP Pools:** Used to dynamically assign addresses via DHCP or other services. The address pool is a range of IP addresses. The pool is associated with the DHCP service.
*   **IP Settings:** Contains many setting, including fast path which is highly recommended to be set to `yes` to take advantage of L3 hardware offloading.
*   **MAC Server:** MikroTik routers have a MAC server that provides low-level discovery to management tools, such as Winbox.

* **IPsec or Wireguard:** Use IPsec or Wireguard for encrypted tunnels, in the case that you must expose a service.
*   **Secure Wireless:** Use strong encryption and passwords on your wireless connections.
* **Disable Unnecessary Interfaces:** Disable any interface you are not currently using.

**10. Trade-offs Between Different Configurations**

*   **Bridging vs Routing:** Bridging is simpler but less flexible. Routing is more complex but allows greater control and more network segmentation.
*   **Static vs Dynamic Routing:** Static routing is easier to configure but not scalable for large networks. Dynamic routing is more complex but adapts to network changes.
*   **Complex QoS:** Complex QoS offers fine control but adds processing overhead. Simple QoS may be sufficient for most networks.
* **Complex Firewalls:** Complex firewalls take more resources, but provide more granular security.
*  **Hardware Offloading:** Hardware offloading improves performance but only applies to certain MikroTik platforms.
* **Switch chips:** Using a switch chip introduces several new benefits, but also brings its own unique configuration complexity.
