The option to add your ownuser-defined root servers(moons) was introduced back in Zerotier v1.2.0 but unfortunately there’s still no way to manage these settings in ROS. You can add the root servers yourself in a private server, container or VPS.

I am even happier upgrading to 1.14. If there is a moon function, it would be perfect
