Okay, let's craft a comprehensive guide to user and user group management in MikroTik RouterOS, specifically tailored for your scenario and expertise level.

## Scenario Description:

We'll configure user and user groups on a MikroTik router (RouterOS 7.12) operating in an SMB environment. The router is managing a network with subnet `60.27.242.0/24`, connected to the `vlan-48` interface. Our goal is to create a user group with specific permissions and assign a user to that group, for access control and auditing. We will be focused on local users created directly on the router and not external authentication, such as radius.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring users and user groups on your MikroTik router.

### Step 1: Create a User Group

* **Purpose:** Define a group with specific access privileges. This allows us to manage permissions at a group level rather than individually for each user.
* **Before:** No user groups are defined, and permissions are managed on a user by user basis.
* **Action:** Create a user group named "monitoring" that will have read-only access to all router configurations, without ability to modify the configuration.
* **CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user group add name=monitoring policy=read
```
* **Winbox GUI:**
  1. Go to `System > Users > Groups`
  2. Click the "+" button.
  3. Set `Name` to "monitoring".
  4. Set `Policy` to "read".
  5. Click `Apply` then `OK`.
* **After:** The `monitoring` user group will exist, with read access, but there are no users yet in the group.
* **Verification:** Use the following command to show newly created group.
```mikrotik
/user group print
```

### Step 2: Create a User and Add it to the Group

* **Purpose:** Create a new user and assign it to the "monitoring" group.
* **Before:** The "monitoring" group exists but no user is assigned to it, existing users do not have the needed permissions.
* **Action:** Create a user with username "monitoruser" and password "MonitorPass123!", adding this new user to the monitoring group.
* **CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user add name=monitoruser password=MonitorPass123! group=monitoring
```
* **Winbox GUI:**
   1. Go to `System > Users`
   2. Click the "+" button.
   3. Set `Name` to "monitoruser".
   4. Set `Group` to "monitoring"
   5. Set `Password` to "MonitorPass123!".
   6. Click `Apply` then `OK`.
* **After:** The "monitoruser" will be able to log in via SSH/Winbox and have read-only access to the router configuration.
* **Verification:** Use the following command to show newly created user.
```mikrotik
/user print
```

### Step 3: Testing User Access

* **Purpose:** Verify that our user "monitoruser" has the correct access level when they log in via Winbox/SSH.
* **Before:** "monitoruser" exists, but their access has not been verified by a log in.
* **Action:**
  1.  Attempt to connect to the router using Winbox with the "monitoruser" username and password.
  2.  Log in with SSH and use the "monitoruser" username and password
* **After:** The user `monitoruser` should be able to log into the router via Winbox/SSH and have read only access to the settings.
* **Verification:** Log into the router with user `monitoruser`.  After logging in attempt to modify a setting, to confirm that they do not have write access.  Any changes to the configuration should not be allowed, or will show an error of insufficient permissions.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
# Create the monitoring group with read access
/user group add name=monitoring policy=read

# Create the monitoruser and assign it to the monitoring group
/user add name=monitoruser password=MonitorPass123! group=monitoring
```
Parameter explanations:

| Command    | Parameter | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/user group add` | `name` | The name of the user group to create, e.g., "monitoring".                                      |
|             | `policy` | The permissions policy for the group, in this case, "read" for read-only access.                |
| `/user add` | `name` | The username for the new user, e.g., "monitoruser".                                           |
|             | `password`| The password for the new user, e.g., "MonitorPass123!".                                  |
|             | `group` | The name of the user group the new user belongs to, e.g., "monitoring".                        |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** User cannot login with the correct credentials.
    *   **Solution:** Double check the username and password. Check if the user is enabled. Verify that there are no firewall rules blocking access from the login location. Try logging in through different means, such as WebFig, Winbox or SSH to see if the issue persists across different interfaces.  The user must be a valid user or part of a valid group to log in.
*  **Problem:** User has too many or not enough permissions.
   *   **Solution:** Check the user's group membership and the associated policy for that group. Update the user policy and group membership as necessary.
*   **Problem:** Accidentally locking yourself out with restrictive permissions.
    *   **Solution:** If you lose administrative access, you can use the MikroTik's Netinstall tool, as described here [https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Netinstall](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Netinstall). This is a more complex process and requires physical access to the router.  It is recommended to have more than one administrator and ensure they have the correct access.  It is also important to only grant access necessary to do the work and not full administrative privileges to all users.
*   **Problem:** Passwords not working with special characters.
    *   **Solution:** Some special characters may cause issues with authentication. Stick to the general ASCII character set whenever possible. Be sure the password is typed correctly.
*  **Security:**  Avoid using easy-to-guess passwords and keep track of all users.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **User Login:** Try to log in using Winbox and/or SSH with the newly created `monitoruser` account to verify that you can log in to the router.
2. **Access Check:** Try to change a setting to confirm that the user does not have write access.
3. **User List Verification:** Use the command `/user print` to confirm the `monitoruser` and user group are configured correctly, and view the properties of the user.  Check that the user is assigned to the correct group.
4. **Group Verification:** Use the command `/user group print` to verify the `monitoring` group and confirm it is set to `read` access.
5. **Audit Logging:** Observe the router logs to verify login attempts are being logged properly.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **External Authentication:** You can use RADIUS to authenticate users, which is more suitable for larger networks.
*   **User Limitations:** You can set limits on session time and concurrent logins for users.
*   **Logging:** Configure detailed logging of user logins and actions for auditing purposes.
*   **API users:** RouterOS has an API user function, similar to the functions outlined here. API users will have access to the API, based on their associated group.
*   **User Profiles:** If you have many similar users, consider using a user profile to preconfigure them instead of setting them up individually.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While user management is often done via CLI or Winbox, here are examples of using the MikroTik REST API:

**Note:** MikroTik's API is powerful but requires careful management. The examples below use a generic API endpoint, this should be replaced with the correct one when using in your router configuration. To obtain a valid API endpoint and key for your router, you must enable the API and set up the appropriate user access via the command line interface or Winbox.

```json
### Creating a user group with API ###
# Endpoint: /user/group
# Method: POST
{
    "name": "monitoring",
    "policy": "read"
}
# Expected Response:
# 201 Created
{
    "id": "*1"
}

### Creating a user with API ###
# Endpoint: /user
# Method: POST
{
  "name": "monitoruser",
  "password": "MonitorPass123!",
  "group": "monitoring"
}
# Expected Response:
# 201 Created
{
    "id": "*2"
}


### Retrieving User Information with API ###
# Endpoint: /user
# Method: GET
# Expected Response:
[
    {
        "id": "*2",
        "name": "monitoruser",
        "group": "monitoring",
        "comment": "",
        "last-logged-in": "2023-10-27T22:10:00+0000",
        "disabled": "false"
    },
    {
       "id": "*3",
        "name": "admin",
        "group": "full",
        "comment": "",
        "last-logged-in": "2023-10-27T23:10:00+0000",
        "disabled": "false"
    }
]
```

**Error Handling:** If a user creation fails (e.g., password policy violation, duplicate username), the API will typically return a `400 Bad Request` status code with a JSON payload detailing the reason. Always check the response status and content for error information.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong passwords for all users, using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Assign only the necessary privileges to users and user groups. Use read-only access wherever possible, minimizing the potential impact of compromised user accounts.
*   **Audit Logs:** Regularly review audit logs for any suspicious login activity. Log all logins and changes to the router.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While not directly supported for local user login in standard RouterOS, consider using 2FA if you configure external authentication (RADIUS).
*   **Firewall Rules:**  Ensure that only trusted networks or specific IP addresses can access the router's login interfaces (Winbox, SSH, WebFig).
*   **API Security:** If using the API, protect the API endpoint using TLS/HTTPS and limit access through a strong access policy.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides a solid base for basic user management. However, improvements include:

*   **More Complex Policies:** For more intricate environments, consider using custom script policies to control more granular permissions.
*   **External Authentication:** In a larger SMB or enterprise context, RADIUS authentication would offer enhanced scalability and centralized control.
*  **Detailed User Information:** Document users, their associated group, and why the user requires access to the router. This documentation should be periodically reviewed and updated.
* **User Session Management:** Implement session timeouts and concurrent login limits for improved security.
* **Password Rotation:** Enforce regular password rotation policies for all users.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

*   **Users:** Represent individual accounts that can log in and manage the router. Each user is associated with a user group, which determines their level of access and ability to modify settings.
*   **User Groups:** Collections of users with shared access permissions. By assigning a user to a group, it inherits the policies defined for that group.
*   **Policies:** Policies are associated with groups and contain permissions that govern what the users are allowed to do on the system. Built-in policies include "read," "write," "test," and "full", while custom policies can be created with scripts.
*   **Authentication:** MikroTik RouterOS supports authentication for console/SSH, Winbox, and WebFig access using local users, and external authentication through RADIUS, among other options.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Local vs. External Authentication:** Local users are easier to manage in small setups, but they lack scalability. RADIUS/external authentication provides a central management point, but increases the complexity of your infrastructure.
*   **Granular vs. Group Permissions:** Individual user permissions allow for specific control, but are hard to maintain on larger environments. Group-based permissions simplify management by applying access control to groups of users and is recommended.
*   **Read-only vs. Write Access:** Granting read-only access to users who need to monitor the system minimizes the potential risk. Write access should only be granted when needed.
*  **API vs Winbox/CLI:** While the API allows for automation and integration into a management system, it is more complex and requires more programming experience to configure and manage. Winbox and CLI are easier for ad hoc access to the system.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This documentation targets RouterOS 7.12, 6.48 and 7.x versions. The commands and concepts described are generally consistent across these versions, but always verify command parameters and functionality with your current version's documentation. Be sure to use a stable and current version of RouterOS.

This comprehensive guide should give you a solid foundation for user and group management on your MikroTik router. Remember to thoroughly test any configuration changes in a test environment before applying them to your production network.
