can you ping that address from the CLI? are you sure that traffic originated from router leaves the router? Not the one originated from LAN.

Add firewall rule to accept port 123

There are dumb ISPs (there is one in my country) that prevent packets with destination port UDP 123 from reaching their customers. If that's the case, you'll might try this solution:viewtopic.php?f=13&t=208791&p=1082590#p1082590
