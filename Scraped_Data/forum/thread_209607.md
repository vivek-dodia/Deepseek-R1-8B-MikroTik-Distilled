Hey guys,I am back with a different issue I need more intelligent people than myself for.Hardware:Router: Mikrotik CCR2004-16G-12S+ with ROS 7.15GPON: Zyxel PMG3000-D20BSince I have switched to the Zyxel GPON I am having spontaneous link down and ups on the SFP interface. The GPON stays up (uptime is more than 3 days during which I had ~40 disconnects).I have used the following way to get access to the GPON directly:https://github.com/xvzf/zyxel-gpon-sfpWith the ISP-provided modem, the connection was rock solid, as such it seems highly likely that it is indeed the GPON that is at fault.The only thing that sticks out here is the following which can be found in the dmesg of the GPON:Code:Select allAny steps except to help my ISP to debug the issue? I already switched the fibre cable from the house delivery point (passive) to the GPON. I have found another occurrence about this but I don't speak Italian (viewtopic.php?t=204929). Another topic about this is also unsolved at the moment (viewtopic.php?t=197293).Regards,Enno aka matrixfueller
