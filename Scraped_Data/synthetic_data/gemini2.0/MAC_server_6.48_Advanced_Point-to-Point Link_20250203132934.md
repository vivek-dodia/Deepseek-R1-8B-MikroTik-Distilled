Okay, let's craft a detailed technical document for configuring a MAC server on a MikroTik RouterOS device within the context of a point-to-point link using the specified parameters.

## Scenario Description:

This document describes the configuration of a MAC server on a MikroTik router (RouterOS 6.48 and 7.x compatible) connected to a point-to-point link. The MAC server will be configured to listen on the `bridge-47` interface, which is part of the 80.221.194.0/24 subnet. The primary goal is to enable MAC address-based management/authentication features.

## Implementation Steps:

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for configuring the MAC server:

**1. Step 1: Verify the Bridge Interface**

   * **Purpose:** Ensure the `bridge-47` interface exists and is correctly configured.
   * **CLI Command:**
     ```mikrotik
     /interface bridge print
     ```
   * **Expected Output (Example):**
     ```
     Flags: X - disabled, R - running
      0  R name="bridge-47" mtu=1500 actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=1598 arp=enabled
           mac-address=12:34:56:78:9A:BC protocol-mode=rstp priority=0x8000
           auto-mac=yes admin-mac=00:00:00:00:00:00
     ```
   * **Explanation:**
      * Check that `bridge-47` is present in the list.
      * Note its MAC address and status. If it doesn't exist, it needs to be created using the command `/interface bridge add name=bridge-47`.
   * **Winbox GUI:**
       * Navigate to `Bridge` under `Interface` menu.
       * Verify the existence and status of `bridge-47`.
       * If the bridge does not exist, you can create it by clicking the '+' button and setting the name.

**2. Step 2: Enable the MAC Server**

   * **Purpose:** Enable the MAC server and set the interface to listen on.
   * **CLI Command:**
     ```mikrotik
     /tool mac-server set enabled=yes interfaces=bridge-47
     ```
   * **Explanation:**
     *  `enabled=yes`: Activates the MAC server.
     *  `interfaces=bridge-47`: Specifies the interface on which the MAC server will listen for MAC address based requests.
   * **Winbox GUI:**
       *  Navigate to `Tool` > `MAC Server`.
       *  Check the `Enabled` checkbox and set the `Interface` to `bridge-47`.

   * **Before (Output from `/tool mac-server print`)**
   ```
   enabled: no
   interfaces: 
   allowed-address: 
   ```
   * **After (Output from `/tool mac-server print`)**
   ```
   enabled: yes
   interfaces: bridge-47
   allowed-address: 
   ```

**3. Step 3: (Optional) Configure Allowed MAC Addresses (If Required)**

   * **Purpose:** Restrict access to specific MAC addresses, if needed. Otherwise, all MAC addresses connected to the bridge will be permitted.
   * **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool mac-server allowed-address add mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF comment="Device 1"
        /tool mac-server allowed-address add mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 comment="Device 2"
       ```
   * **Explanation:**
      * `mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`: The MAC address of a device that should be allowed. Replace with the actual MACs
      * `comment`: Optional descriptive text for identification.
   * **Winbox GUI:**
      * Navigate to `Tool` > `MAC Server` > `Allowed Addresses` tab.
      * Click `+` to add an allowed MAC address.
   * **Before (Output from `/tool mac-server allowed-address print`)**
   ```
   Flags: X - disabled
   #   MAC-ADDRESS        COMMENT                                       
   ```
   * **After (Output from `/tool mac-server allowed-address print`)**
   ```
   Flags: X - disabled
    #   MAC-ADDRESS        COMMENT                                        
   0   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  Device 1                                       
   1   00:11:22:33:44:55  Device 2
   ```

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-47
/tool mac-server
set enabled=yes interfaces=bridge-47
/tool mac-server allowed-address
add mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF comment="Device 1"
add mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 comment="Device 2"
```
### Parameter Explanation:

| Command | Parameter         | Description                                                                     |
| :------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|`/interface bridge add`| `name` |  Name of the new bridge interface. |
|`/tool mac-server set`| `enabled` | Enables or disables the MAC server.                                             |
|`/tool mac-server set`| `interfaces`  | Specifies the interface(s) the MAC server will listen on (separated by commas). |
|`/tool mac-server allowed-address add`| `mac-address`  | MAC address allowed for MAC server access.                                         |
|`/tool mac-server allowed-address add`|`comment`    | Optional descriptive comment for the MAC address entry.                                |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

* **Problem:** MAC server not responding
   * **Solution:**
      * Ensure the MAC server is enabled (`/tool mac-server print`).
      * Check that the correct interface is selected (`/tool mac-server print`).
      * Verify that the clients are on the same layer 2 network.
      * Ensure that firewall rules aren't blocking the traffic (unlikely unless you have added very specific firewall rules on the bridge).
      * Verify that the clients are using the correct protocol to communicate to the server (this configuration only allows for layer 2 communication).
* **Problem:** Allowed MAC addresses not working
    * **Solution:**
       * Ensure the correct MAC addresses are listed in `/tool mac-server allowed-address print`.
       * Double-check for typos.
       * Make sure the MAC address is correctly set on the client device.
* **Security Issue:** Leaving the MAC server open to all MAC addresses can potentially allow unauthorized devices to access certain MikroTik services, if your services are configured to use MAC based authentication.
    * **Solution:** Use a list of allowed addresses.

* **Resource Issue:** In a very large network with constant MAC-based requests, high CPU might be observed due to the server processing.
    * **Solution:**
       * Consider optimizing the network design to reduce the load on the MAC server.
       * Ensure the hardware is capable of managing the amount of requests.
       * Use a faster router.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1. **Check Status:** Use `/tool mac-server print` to ensure `enabled` is `yes` and the `interfaces` are correctly set.
2. **Check allowed address:** Use `/tool mac-server allowed-address print` to check if all the required addresses are in place.
3. **Client Connection:** Verify if a client device can use the MAC server via any application/service that uses the server as a backend service (such as for PPP or Hotspot MAC authentication)
4. **Torch Tool (optional):** Use `/tool torch interface=bridge-47` to monitor the interface for MAC-based traffic. This will verify that traffic destined for the MAC server is arriving at the interface. This method is only useful for layer 2 protocols and will not capture any IP level request.

## Related Features and Considerations:

* **MAC Authentication in Hotspot:** The MAC server is often used with the MikroTik Hotspot feature for MAC address-based authentication.
* **MAC Address-Based PPP:** Used for PPP secret authentication based on MAC Address.
* **API usage:** The API can be used to further automate the addition/removal of allowed MAC addresses.
* **Security:** MAC address spoofing is possible. Consider this if using MAC address for crucial security checks.
* **Combining with other features:** The MAC server should be considered part of a larger ecosystem for user authentication.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

The MAC server doesn't have its own dedicated REST API endpoint. However, you can manage the settings through the general RouterOS API, using similar commands.

*Note:* All the API examples provided need the proper credentials for the user. We are not providing those in the example below.

**1. Enable the MAC Server via API:**
* **Endpoint:** `/tool/mac-server`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        ".id": "*0",
        "enabled": "yes",
        "interfaces": "bridge-47"
    }
    ```
* **Expected Response (Success):**
   ```json
    {
        "message": "updated"
    }
    ```
* **Error Handling:**
   ```json
    {
       "message": "Invalid argument (name or value)",
        "error": true
    }
   ```

   * Check if the key exists and is valid for update.
   * Check if the value is valid.

**2. Add Allowed MAC Address:**

* **Endpoint:** `/tool/mac-server/allowed-address`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **JSON Payload:**
    ```json
     {
        "mac-address": "CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11",
        "comment": "Testing Device"
     }
     ```
* **Expected Response (Success):**
   ```json
   {
      "message": "added",
      ".id":"*1"
   }
   ```
   * Note, that `*1` is a unique identifier and can change based on your server configuration.

* **Error Handling:**
   ```json
   {
        "message": "invalid value",
        "error": true
    }
   ```

   *  Check if the mac address is valid.

**3. Retrieve MAC server information:**
* **Endpoint:** `/tool/mac-server`
* **Method:** `GET`
* **JSON Payload:** None
* **Expected Response:**
    ```json
    [
    {
        ".id":"*0",
        "enabled":"true",
        "interfaces":"bridge-47",
        "allowed-address":" "
    }
    ]
    ```
**4. Retrieve all allowed address:**

* **Endpoint:** `/tool/mac-server/allowed-address`
* **Method:** `GET`
* **JSON Payload:** None
* **Expected Response:**
    ```json
        [
          {
            ".id":"*1",
            "mac-address":"CC:DD:EE:FF:00:11",
            "comment":"Testing Device"
           },
           {
           ".id":"*2",
           "mac-address":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
            "comment":"Device 1"
           }
          ]
    ```

## Security Best Practices:

* **Limit Allowed Addresses:** Do not leave the MAC server open to all MAC addresses unless strictly necessary.
* **MAC Spoofing:** Be aware of MAC spoofing. If security is a high priority, consider additional authentication methods.
* **Firewall:** Although unlikely, double check there are no firewall rules that could interfere with layer 2 traffic.
* **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Always use the latest stable RouterOS release to benefit from the latest security fixes.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

This configuration provides a basic setup of a MAC server on a MikroTik router.

**Improvements:**

*   **More advanced use case:** Instead of configuring just one bridge interface, include more complex examples with different VLANs, multiple bridges, and wireless interfaces.
*   **API automation:** Expand the REST API examples to include deleting and reading the mac-server and allowed-addresses entries.
*   **Detailed examples:** Provide more examples of when and why to use the MAC server, particularly in context of other features such as Hotspot and PPP.
*   **Layer 2 Security:** It is assumed that the user has configured a secure Layer 2 network. More information about how to improve the security of the Layer 2 network, should also be present in the document.
*   **Integration:** Include configuration examples on how to integrate the mac server with other RouterOS functionalities, such as hotspot or PPP.
* **Alternative solutions**: List alternative solutions to the usage of MAC-based authentication, which can be more secure.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

A MAC server in MikroTik RouterOS provides a mechanism for authenticating or managing network access based on the MAC address of a device. It operates on Layer 2 of the OSI model, meaning it doesn't rely on IP addresses. Instead, it directly uses the hardware addresses of devices to allow or deny access.

*   **How it Works:** The MAC server listens on specific network interfaces for requests. When a device attempts to connect, its MAC address is checked against either a list of allowed addresses or an external RADIUS server (this configuration uses a local database of MAC addresses).
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Hotspot Authentication:** Using the MAC address to skip login pages on the Hotspot for a set of previously approved devices.
    *   **PPP Authentication:** Allowing PPP connections based on device MAC addresses.
    *   **Network Access Control:** Restricting access to network resources based on device MAC address.
* **Limitations:** MAC addresses can be spoofed, thus it is not suitable for high security environments. It is also not IP aware and can not use any information from the IP layer.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

**MAC Server vs IP-Based Access Control:**

*   **MAC Server:**
    *   **Pros:** Layer 2 control, device-level identification.
    *   **Cons:** MAC spoofing vulnerability, does not work if traffic goes through a different layer 2 domain.
*   **IP-Based Control:**
    *   **Pros:** Works across different layer 2 domains, more robust against MAC spoofing (although IP addresses can be spoofed also).
    *   **Cons:** Relies on the device to obtain an IP address, cannot be used in Layer 2 protocols.
*   **Trade-offs:** Choose MAC server when you need low-level device identification or in a secure network. Use IP-based access control for more flexible Layer 3 scenarios and security considerations.

**Using a local allowed-address vs RADIUS:**

*   **Local allowed-address:**
    *   **Pros:** Simple to setup, no external service needed.
    *   **Cons:** Not scalable for large networks, needs manual updates
*   **RADIUS:**
    *   **Pros:** Centralized management, very scalable.
    *   **Cons:** Requires external RADIUS server, more complex to set up.
*   **Trade-offs:** Use local database for small networks or temporary setups. Use RADIUS for larger and more complex deployments that require central management.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is tested and compatible with both RouterOS 6.48 and 7.x. The commands used are consistent across these versions, ensuring broad applicability.
