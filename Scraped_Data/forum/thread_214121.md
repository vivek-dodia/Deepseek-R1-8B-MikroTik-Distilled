CHR, well if you are using CHR at home and not in a  VPS, cannot help  you.The idea of CHR is to acquire a public  IP address  or at least a public WANIP in a specific geographic location.The key being  you no longer need BTH because regular wireguard will work just fine.Good point that it should be included in case one is use CHR behind a non-public IP....... probably they didnt think of it??I believe BTH is limited currently to arm and Tile devices, so there may be other limitations at play..
