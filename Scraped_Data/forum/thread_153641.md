```

I've got this script from a search but also no email sent when a new device connected to networkI put it in dhcp server alert with default settings of new alertCode:Select allthere is no log entryI think the event didn't fire and the code never executed

Anyone knows how to send email only if a new device connected.I mean, if the "lease time" is not over yet, then don't send emailI use this modification to "remember" already sent MAC addresses (globally). The downside is that it sends again all addresses after restart.- Also, it would be nice to implement TTL for each record, but this is good enough for me right now.- Note that my version also sends the hostname of the connected device.Code:Select all
