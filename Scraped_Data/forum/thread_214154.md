```
> interface/ethernet/set numbers=ether1 mtu=1499 ;
```

Let's hypothetically assume the following:I change the MTU value of an Interface.Code:Select allHow can I reset the DEFAULT (mtu=1500) value?

```
/interface/ethernet/set [find] mtu=1500

Code:Select all

```
/interface/ethernet/set [find] mtu=1500
```

Code:Select allBut how do you know that 1500 ???

```
/interface/ethernet/reset [find] mtu=
```

Code:Select allRuns with no complaints and chooses 1500 as default with RouterOS 7.16.2.

```
/interface/ethernet print
/interface/ethernet reset 0 mtu=
```

```
/interface/ethernet/reset [find default-name=ether1] mtu=
```

Yup, "reset" is the command to, well, reset something to default.  Most RouterOS config items support the "reset" subcommand.FWIW, at the Terminal prompt, you can do a:Code:Select allIn @ConradPino's example the [find] will find all ethernet, and reset the mtu to default on ALL ports.  Possible to add a filter in [find] to limit it to specific port(s).  Using [find] is needed if this is something you want to script for non-CLI use (since in /system/script, using the numbers= may change).  So for example, you can find by the "default name", since if you're reset'ing something in script, it's name may have changed... so using "default-name=" in the find let you get the right interface (even if user renamed the interface)Code:Select allIf you don't provide "mtu=" - reset will make all attributes the default value.

```
/interface/ethernet reset ether1 mtu=1500 l2mtu=1584
```

```
/interface/ethernet reset [find where default-name=ether1]
```

Stop suggest using "0" and use interface name.Ignoring the i*** of change randomly the MTU,the correct syntax isset ether1 mtu=1500and [find] must not be used alone, because change everything, not only that interface./interface ethernet reset NOT exist on v6 (exist only reset-counters and reset-mac-address)on v7 exist reset, reset-counters, and reset-mac-addressThe reset RESET ALL EXCEPT COMMENT... for reset and set AT SAME TIME can be added some parameters likeCode:Select allThis RESET ALL EXCEPT COMMENT, but after the reset set mtu and l2mtu to provided values.So the correct sytax to reset all ether1 parameters to default values, except comments, is:Code:Select allThere is not a command to reset to default value a single property.In this case is easy to know that the default is 1500 and must be keeped like that,because if you not know the default value, mean that you do not really understand what is the MTU and how it works.

```
/interface/ethernet reset [find where default-name=ether1]
```

So the correct sytax to reset all ether1 parameters to default values, except comments, is:Code:Select allThe "where" is redundant AFAIK, so not sure why you show that.  I am missing something?

```
/interface ethernet reset numbers=[/interface ethernet find where default-name=ether1]
```

I like corerct syntax and avoid shorting for unreadabilty.I dislike full syntax but not where:Code:Select all

@anavWhere is???even if you specificaties, the command will reset the whole interfaceAlready wroted, with explanation....viewtopic.php?t=214154#p1121429(obviously MTU and L2MTU are 666 and 777 just for test..........)terminal code
