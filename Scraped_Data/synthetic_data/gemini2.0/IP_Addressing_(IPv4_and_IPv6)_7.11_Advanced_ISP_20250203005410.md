Okay, this is a deep dive into MikroTik RouterOS configuration, tailored for an advanced user in an ISP environment, using version 7.11 (and noting relevant differences from 6.48 and 7.x). We will cover your provided topics, specifically focusing on IP addressing with your subnet and interface example, and then broadly discuss the additional topics you listed.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:**

We are an ISP managing a customer network. We have a VLAN interface (vlan-95) that needs to be configured with a specific IPv4 subnet (55.146.109.0/24). We'll also touch on adding IPv6 addresses. The configuration needs to be efficient, secure, and scalable. We need to leverage the core MikroTik capabilities to achieve this.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **Interface:** VLAN interface named `vlan-95` must be configured.
*   **IPv4 Address:** Address `55.146.109.1/24` needs to be assigned to `vlan-95`.
*   **Scalability:**  The design must be able to scale to manage more VLANs and subnets.
*   **Security:** Basic security considerations such as filtering access via management IP and firewall should be included.
*   **Monitoring:** We must have the ability to easily monitor the status of this interface.
*   **IPv6 Considerations:** Brief overview of how IPv6 would be integrated (as an example).

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)**

We will use the CLI primarily, as it provides more granular control, but will mention how to do it in Winbox as well.

**Step 1: Verify Interface Exists or Create It**
   *   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    print
    ```
    Look for `vlan-95`. If it doesn't exist, create it as shown below, making sure it is tagged with the proper VLAN ID (95).
     ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add name=vlan-95 vlan-id=95 interface=ether1
     ```
     (Replace `ether1` with the physical interface it is built on, likely a port for VLAN traffic)
     *   **Winbox:**
        1.  Navigate to `Interfaces`.
        2.  Click the `+` (Add) button.
        3.  Select `VLAN`.
        4.  Enter `Name`: `vlan-95`, `VLAN ID`: `95` and chose appropriate `Interface`.
        5.  Click `Apply` and `OK`.

**Step 2: Assign IPv4 Address to vlan-95**

   *   **CLI:**
     ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=55.146.109.1/24 interface=vlan-95
     ```
   *   **Winbox:**
        1.  Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
        2.  Click the `+` (Add) button.
        3.  Enter `Address`: `55.146.109.1/24` and select `vlan-95` for `Interface`.
        4.  Click `Apply` and `OK`.

**Step 3: Verify the Configuration**

   *   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    print
    ```
    Confirm `55.146.109.1/24` is listed with the `vlan-95` interface.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface print
     ```
    Confirm interface is active with the correct VLAN.
   *   **Winbox:**
        1.  Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`. Check that the address is listed.
        2.  Navigate to `Interfaces`. Check that `vlan-95` is `R` (running) and VLAN-ID.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

```mikrotik
# Create VLAN Interface
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-95 vlan-id=95 interface=ether1

# Assign IPv4 Address to VLAN interface
/ip address
add address=55.146.109.1/24 interface=vlan-95

# Optional: Add IPv6 address (example)
# /ipv6 address
# add address=2001:db8:1234:5678::1/64 interface=vlan-95

# Optional: Add description
/interface set vlan-95 comment="Customer VLAN for Subnet 55.146.109.0/24"
```

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Error Scenario 1: Interface Does Not Exist**

    *   **Error:** `input does not match any value of interface` when configuring IP address.
    *   **Cause:** The VLAN interface wasn't created.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface vlan print` to confirm. Use `/interface vlan add` to create it.
*   **Error Scenario 2: IP Address Conflict**
    *   **Error:** IP address is not accepted or has "invalid" flag (red).
    *   **Cause:** An overlapping IP address is used by another interface or a DHCP server has reserved this address.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip address print` to identify conflicts.  Check DHCP server leases ( `/ip dhcp-server lease print` ) if applicable.
*   **Error Scenario 3: Incorrect VLAN ID or Parent Interface**
    *   **Error:**  The network will not work even when everything is configured correctly.
    *   **Cause:** Mismatched VLAN ID's, the parent interface was not the right one for physical wiring.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface vlan print` and compare to the physical interface configuration and switch config.
*   **Error Scenario 4: Missing Routing.**
    *   **Error:** Device will have the IP set but not be able to reach devices on this subnet.
    *   **Cause:** Missing routing configuration in `/ip route`
    *  **Troubleshooting** Use `/ip route print` to verify the routes to the subnets.

**Diagnostics:**
*   **Ping:** `ping 55.146.109.x` to test connectivity.
*   **Traceroute:** `traceroute 55.146.109.x` to see the network path.
*  **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=vlan-95` to monitor traffic and identify possible issues.

**5. Verification and Testing**

1.  **Ping Test (CLI):** From the MikroTik router:

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 55.146.109.254
    ```

    Expected: Successful ping responses. (Note that 55.146.109.254 is an example end point device).
2.  **Ping Test (from a client):** Verify that from a client, you can ping the MikroTik router's interface (55.146.109.1).

```mikrotik
# Enable API
/ip service set api address=0.0.0.0/0 disabled=no
/ip service set api-ssl address=0.0.0.0/0 disabled=no certificate=your_cert_name_here
```

*   **API Endpoint:** `https://your_router_ip/rest/ip/address` (assuming the `api-ssl` service is enabled)

*   **Authentication:**
    *   API token is generated on a per-user basis `/user/print`.
    *   Set the `Authorization` header in the HTTP request to `Bearer <your_api_token>`

**Example 1: Get IP Addresses (GET Method)**

```bash
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token" https://your_router_ip/rest/ip/address
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "*1",
    "address": "55.146.109.1/24",
    "interface": "vlan-95",
    "network": "55.146.109.0",
    "disabled": "false",
    "dynamic": "false",
    "actual-interface": "vlan-95"
  },
  {
    "id": "*2",
    "address": "192.168.88.1/24",
    "interface": "ether2",
    "network": "192.168.88.0",
     "disabled": "false",
     "dynamic": "false",
     "actual-interface": "ether2"
    }
]
```

```

**Expected Response:**

```json
 {
    "message": "removed"
 }
```

**Note:**

*   Use appropriate authentication and secure connections with HTTPS and valid SSL certificate.
*   API tokens should be kept secure.
*   MikroTik API documentation is the best source for details of all possible API interactions.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:**
    *   *MikroTik Implementation:* Bridges in RouterOS function at Layer 2 of the OSI model. A bridge allows you to connect multiple interfaces together as if they were on the same network segment, allowing them to share a single subnet. This is useful for creating a simple switch like infrastructure.
    *   *Why Use It?* Bridging eliminates the need for routing within a network segment.
*   **Routing:**
    *   *MikroTik Implementation:* RouterOS routing is based on a routing table, and uses various static routes, connected routes, and routing protocols to find the best path for packets. It can make policy-based routing decisions and use multiple routing tables.
    *   *Why Use It?* Routing is critical for connecting networks, allowing traffic to flow from one subnet to another, especially if subnets are not physically connected.
*   **Firewall:**
    *   *MikroTik Implementation:* The RouterOS firewall is stateful, which means it tracks connection details. It uses chains like `input`, `forward`, and `output` to manage different types of traffic. Rules are processed in order and the first rule that matches a packet is applied.
    *   *Why Use It?* Firewalls are essential for network security, filtering traffic to only allow what is necessary and blocking malicious access.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use long, complex passwords for all user accounts, especially for administrator accounts, API access and winbox access.
*   **Restrict Access:** Use firewall rules to limit access to the router's management interfaces to only trusted IP addresses. Use management VLAN's.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable any RouterOS services you are not actively using (e.g. telnet, www, etc.)
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable RouterOS version to patch security vulnerabilities, and ensure critical features and updates are installed.
*   **Secure API:** Use a strong API token and restrict API access only via secured connections.
*   **Disable Default User:** Either change the password of the default user, or create your own admin user and delete the default user (or rename it).
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review the router's logs for suspicious activity. Configure logging to syslog server for detailed analysis.
*   **Use Certificates:** Use valid SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections.
*   **Secure RoMON:** If using RoMON, restrict access.
*   **Disable UPnP:** The UPnP service can expose your network, if not needed turn off.
*   **Enable RPKI:** If using BGP, then enable route origin validation.
*   **Monitor Interface:** Monitor interface statistics for anomalies.
*   **Disable Unused Protocols:** Disable unused routing protocols.

**10. Detailed Explanation and Configuration Examples for the Required Topics**

These topics are now covered within the previous sections, with explanations and CLI examples.

**Trade-offs Between Configurations**

*   **Bridging vs. Routing:** Bridging is easier to set up for local networks, but routing gives better control and scalability between networks. Choose routing when networks need to communicate across network boundaries or when you need granular control over traffic flow.
*   **Static IP vs. DHCP:** Static IPs are easier to manage in small networks, but DHCP is essential for dynamic environments. Use static IPs for critical infrastructure and DHCP for clients that need to change addresses.
*   **Hardware Offloading:**  Use L3 Hardware Offloading for high performance, but be mindful that it might not support all RouterOS features.
*  **QoS Configurations** - Simple Queue, or PCQ. Simple Queues are easy to setup, but do not scale as well as PCQ which uses classification logic to create multiple queues. PCQ requires more thought and understanding before use.

This detailed explanation covers your requested topics and provides a solid foundation for advanced MikroTik management. Remember to always test configurations in a lab environment before deploying them in a production network. The examples provided are a starting point, and each situation will likely have unique needs.
