## Bridge Setup in RouterOS 6.x/7.x for ISPs

### Configuration Scenario and Requirements

- ISP network with multiple physical Ethernet interfaces
- Requirement to bridge multiple physical interfaces into a single logical segment
- Isolation of traffic between different physical interfaces

### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Create the Bridge Interface**
- Open Winbox or use the CLI and connect to the router.
- Navigate to **Interfaces** > **Bridge**.
- Click **(+)** to create a new bridge interface.
- Enter a name for the bridge (e.g., **ISP-BRIDGE**).

**2. Add Physical Interfaces to the Bridge**
- Select the **ISP-BRIDGE** interface and go to the **Ports** tab.
- Click **(+)** to add physical interfaces to the bridge.
- Select the desired interfaces and click **OK**.

**3. Configure Bridging Settings (Optional)**
- Go to the **ISP-BRIDGE** interface and navigate to the **Bridge** tab.
- Adjust bridging options as needed (e.g., Spanning Tree Protocol).

### Complete Configuration Commands

**1. Create Bridge Interface**
```
/interface bridge add name=ISP-BRIDGE
```

**2. Add Interfaces to Bridge**
```
/interface bridge port add bridge=ISP-BRIDGE interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=ISP-BRIDGE interface=ether2
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

- **Duplicate bridge interface names:** Ensure that the bridge interface name is unique.
- **Adding interfaces already in use:** Avoid adding interfaces that are already assigned to other bridges or interfaces.
- **Incorrect bridge settings:** Review the bridge settings and Spanning Tree Protocol options to avoid network instability.

### Verification and Testing Steps

- Verify that the bridge interface is created and enabled.
- Check if the physical interfaces are properly added to the bridge.
- Perform traffic tests to confirm connectivity between devices on different physical interfaces.

### Related Features and Considerations

- **VLANs:** Bridges can be used to create VLANs by assigning different VLAN IDs to different ports.
- **Security:** Consider applying MAC address filtering or VLAN tagging to enhance network security.
- **Performance:** Monitor the CPU and memory usage of the bridge to ensure optimal performance.
