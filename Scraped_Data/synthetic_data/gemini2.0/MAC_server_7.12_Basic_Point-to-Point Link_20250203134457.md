Okay, let's dive into crafting detailed documentation for setting up a MAC server on a MikroTik router with a focus on the specific context provided.

## Scenario Description:

We are creating a simple point-to-point link using two MikroTik routers, where one router will act as a MAC server and the other as a MAC client. Our primary goal is to demonstrate how to use the MAC server feature in RouterOS. Specifically, we'll configure a MAC server on the specified interface (`ether-76`) with the given subnet (`154.172.190.0/24`). This setup allows the server to respond to MAC address discovery requests. We'll focus on the basic configuration for this feature with minimal additional security.

## Implementation Steps:

**Initial State:** We are assuming a MikroTik router with a factory default configuration or minimal configuration before implementing the MAC server. The `ether-76` interface is enabled and not assigned any IP address. This is a basic default configuration on a MikroTik, but with ether76 enabled and not assigned an IP.
* Before making any changes we can check what the configuration looks like with the following command:

```mikrotik
/ip address print
/interface print
```

**Step 1: Enable the MAC Server on the Interface**

*   **Description:** The `mac-server` is a discovery service. It will receive MAC Discovery requests and responds to them, this service is interface based. We need to enable it on the specified interface.
*   **Action:** We will use the `/interface mac-server` to configure it. This is the primary command for managing MAC server on a per interface basis.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface mac-server set ether-76 enabled=yes
    ```
    *   `/interface mac-server`:  Navigates to the MAC server settings.
    *   `set ether-76`: Specifies the interface to configure.
    *   `enabled=yes`: Enables the MAC server on the `ether-76` interface.

*   **Before Configuration Effect:** Running the `/interface mac-server print` command before enabling the mac server on ether76 should display a default configuration where the interface is disabled.
*   **After Configuration Effect:** Running the `/interface mac-server print` command after the above configuration should display that the mac server is enabled. Example output is shown below:

```
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
 #     INTERFACE        ARP          ENABLED
 0   ether-76        enabled      yes
```

*   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to Interfaces -> MAC Server. Find `ether-76`, double-click and set `Enabled` checkbox to checked.

**Step 2: Assign an IP Address to the Interface**

*   **Description:** While the MAC server itself doesn't *require* an IP address, in practical scenarios, it is often coupled with IP layer services and therefore it is better to assign an IP address to the interface for testing purposes. This IP Address can be different than the network the MAC server is monitoring if required.
*   **Action:** We use the `/ip address` command to add an IP address.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add interface=ether-76 address=154.172.190.1/24
    ```
    *   `/ip address add`: Adds a new IP address configuration.
    *   `interface=ether-76`: Specifies the interface to bind the IP address to.
    *   `address=154.172.190.1/24`: Sets the IP address and subnet mask.

*   **Before Configuration Effect:** The output of `/ip address print` should not contain an IP for ether-76
*   **After Configuration Effect:** Running the command `/ip address print` will show the interface `ether-76` is assigned the address `154.172.190.1/24`.

```
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
 #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
 0   154.172.190.1/24  154.172.190.0     ether-76
```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to IP -> Addresses. Click `+`, select Interface `ether-76` and set `Address` to `154.172.190.1/24`.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
#Enable MAC Server on ether-76
/interface mac-server set ether-76 enabled=yes

#Add an IP Address to the interface ether-76
/ip address add interface=ether-76 address=154.172.190.1/24
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **MAC Server Not Responding:**
    *   **Problem:** The MAC server might be enabled on the wrong interface, or there may be firewall rules blocking communication.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that the MAC server is enabled on the *correct* interface using `/interface mac-server print`. Also, make sure that there is no firewall rules blocking communication. The mac server is typically a service at the link layer and not IP layer, therefore firewall rules usually dont affect the mac server.
*   **IP Address Conflicts:**
    *   **Problem:** An IP address assigned to the interface might conflict with another device on the network.
    *   **Solution:** Check the network to identify any duplicate IP addresses and ensure all the addresses are unique.
*   **Incorrect Subnet Mask:**
    *   **Problem:** The subnet mask is configured incorrectly on the interface, which could prevent devices from communicating effectively.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check that the subnet mask on all devices that need to communicate are set to the same subnet and is also correct for the interface.
* **MAC server does not require an IP address:**
   * **Problem:** You might be expecting the MAC server to need to be configured with an IP.
   * **Solution:** A mac server operates at the L2 level and therefore it does not need a IP configuration to function.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **MAC Discovery:** Use the `/tool mac-scan` to discover MAC addresses on the network connected to the interface. From the client router use the following command:
    ```mikrotik
    /tool mac-scan interface=ether-76
    ```
    *   This will display a list of MAC addresses that are visible on that interface. If the MAC server is working, you will see the mac address of the router running the mac server.
2.  **Ping Test:** Ping a device on the network to ensure there is basic connectivity and also to generate traffic if the mac server does not already have a client sending it mac discovery requests.
    ```mikrotik
     /ping 154.172.190.2
    ```
3.  **Torch Tool:** Use `/tool torch` on the interface to examine real-time traffic patterns. Check if any MAC discovery or network traffic is coming through the interface.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether-76
    ```
4.  **Interface Monitoring:** Check the `/interface monitor` to verify that the interface is connected and operational.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface monitor ether-76
    ```

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **MAC Winbox Discovery:** The MAC server allows Winbox to discover a router on a network via MAC address even when there is no IP address configured. This can be a very helpful tool for connecting to a MikroTik when you are unsure of the configured IP address.
*   **DHCP:** The MAC server can be used in conjunction with a DHCP server to assign IP addresses based on MAC address.
*   **Security:** Be mindful of who has access to the network. Do not run a public facing MAC server. In most situations the MAC server should be disabled, as it does not have much practical use case. A MAC server exposes the MAC address of your device, and therefore the network interface.
* **MAC Server usage in other MikroTik tools**: Many tools inside of MikroTik use mac discovery, like the neighbour discovery, bridge management, etc. The mac server functionality can be used as part of many other tools and is important to understand when using them.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

```
# Enable MAC server on ether-76
# API Endpoint: /interface/mac-server

# Request Method: POST
# JSON Payload:
{
  ".id": "ether-76",
  "enabled": "yes"
}

# Expected Response:
{
    "message": "updated"
}

# Example curl command
# curl -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"enabled": "yes", ".id": "ether-76"}'  https://192.168.88.1/rest/interface/mac-server -u admin:PASSWORD


# Get mac-server configuration
# API Endpoint: /interface/mac-server
# Request Method: GET
# Expected Response:
[
  {
    "arp": "enabled",
    "enabled": "yes",
    "interface": "ether-76",
    ".id": "ether-76"
  }
]
# Example curl command
# curl -k -X GET https://192.168.88.1/rest/interface/mac-server -u admin:PASSWORD

# Error Handling
# In the event that the interface is not found the rest API will return a 404 error code
# example error response:
# {
#     "message": "not found"
# }
```

**Note:** Replace `192.168.88.1` with your MikroTik router's IP address and `admin:PASSWORD` with your credentials.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Interface Isolation:** Limit the interfaces where the MAC server is enabled to only those that require it.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Although the MAC server operates at the link layer, it's advisable to have IP-layer firewall rules to protect your network.
*   **Disable If Not Needed:** If the MAC server is not required for a particular configuration or function, disable it to minimize exposure.
*   **Physical Access:** Secure the physical access to your router.
*  **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS updated to protect against security vulnerabilities.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration is very basic and targeted specifically to the scenario mentioned.

*   **Improvements:**
    *   Adding support for MAC ACLs if required.
    *   Configuring multiple interfaces, if it was required in the given scenario.
    *   Configuring rate limiting if there was a concern for DoS via mac discovery.
    *   Implementing security measures, such as limiting MAC access to specific devices.
    *   Implement logging to monitor MAC server activity.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

A MAC server in MikroTik RouterOS is a service that listens for and responds to MAC address discovery requests on a specified network interface. This service enables devices on the same local network to identify other devices by their MAC address. The MAC server is particularly useful for discovering devices before they obtain an IP address. It works at layer 2, meaning it does not need an IP address on the interface to operate, and it is essential for several RouterOS functionalities, such as device discovery in Winbox and neighboring router discovery.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

The main trade-offs with enabling a MAC server on your router are as follows:

* **Benefits:**
  *   **Simplified Device Discovery:** Enables easy discovery of devices on the same Layer 2 segment using MAC addresses, especially in situations where devices are not yet assigned an IP.
    * **Winbox Access:** Facilitates initial setup and connection to a RouterOS device that may not have a known IP address configured.
    * **Integration with Other Services:** Essential for many RouterOS tools, like bridge, neighbor discovery, etc.

* **Drawbacks:**
    *   **Security Risk:** Broadcasting MAC addresses can provide information to potential attackers.
    *   **Resource Usage:** While minimal, having a MAC server service does consume some resources. Especially on devices with limited resources.
    *   **Privacy Concern:** Exposes MAC addresses, which can be used for device tracking.

*   **Alternatives:**
    *   **DHCP:** Using DHCP with static leases based on MAC addresses can be a more controlled way to manage IP addressing and device association.
    *   **Static IP Configuration:** Manually assigning IPs to devices can bypass the need for MAC address discovery, but lacks flexibility.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Limited use cases:** Typically the mac server function should be used as needed and disabled by default.
    *   **Security:** Only use it when the trade-off of a small amount of security exposure is worth the functionality it provides.
    *   **Network Scale:** For very large networks other solutions are typically used instead of the mac discovery function.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is valid for RouterOS 7.12 (and any RouterOS 7.x or 6.48). The commands used are standard for these versions. If you were using an older version it is possible that they do not have the `interface mac-server` command and you would have to rely on other means of configuring mac discovery.
