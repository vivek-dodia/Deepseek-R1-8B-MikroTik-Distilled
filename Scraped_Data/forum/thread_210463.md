Hi all. New guy here. I'm pretty new into the network/wifi field. So be gentleoh and of course, any info/help would be greatly appreciated!!I've recently been tasked to assist with a WiFi issue at a company of roughly 40 - 50 users. I wa able to setup CAPsMAN, albeit not able to manually specify channels to the AP's. We are using 2.4Ghz and the 5Ghz band. We have a couple of mobile devices that connects to the 2.4Ghz band.Attached is the network layout. Of the existing as it is now, and then of the New Network. Reason for my question is that, if I do get teh business to replace the hardware, that the WiFi would be better than what it was, otherwise, I'll be left with a red face :OI've also attahced my laptops connectivity to the 5Ghz network. My laptops is the one highlighted.Please do feel free to request any info from me. I wasn't entirely sure what kind of info I had to upload.My devices are as follow:1 x Mikrotik hAP ac2 Router4 x Mikrotik AP's with PoE injectors (RbcAPGi-5acD2nD)1 x ISP ONT Modem. (Modem that provider installed for that converts Fibre to Ethernet and plugs into hAP AC2 Router1 x D-Link 24 port Gigabit Unmanaged SwitchI would like to give tops to gigabyte091 for devices he suggested we could get to improve efficiency of the network as well as futureproof the network, in one of my other posts.He suggested the new equipment in the attached New Network.Edit: I need to mention that the closest AP to me is the Blue AP. I'm roughly 6m away from it. The AP's are generally about 10m apart from one another. Walls in the office are mostly drywalling. if need be, I can create and upload a layout of the office?

Well, then start by describing the issue you need to resolve first.

The topic name might give an indicationBut agreed, both problem description and the requirements are very welcome!

"Slow wifi" is like going to my mechanic and telling him to fix a "slow car". It is the car from my uncle and I already tried to clean the spark plugs.Sry, I'll try to be gentle

Uff, gentle... Good thing you don't have question about wireguard...Our local wireguard guru doesn't know what gentle isJokes aside, I don't know if wifiwave2 drivers are available on ROS6 so that's why i recommended you update to ROS7.What do you mean that wifi is slow ? What is your speed, ping when measured by speedtest ?

Slow wifi ... new in the wifi world ... so many things to learn! Really it's a lot.1. Speed definitions.- there is the "interface rate", that is the transmission rate (like the speed of an ethernet connection)- there is the max and actual dynamic rate at an instant in time for a wifi radio . Windows shows always the max rate only, not the actual rate ! (see the 144Mbps)-The max rate depends on the encoding (signal quality) and channel width (20,40 or even 80 MHz wide) Seehttps://mcsindex.com/. Find your 144,4Mbps with 20Mhz width, short guard interval, dual stream)-Mikrotik shows the dynamic rate (can be different for Tx and Rx). But your sessions are too short in time, and the volume too low , to see some higher speeds here. (It's gradually building up with good trnsmissions. It drops again with missed transmissions!)- There is the transmission time utilisation (due to inter transmission gaps.) Important with small transmission packets. Mikrotik WLAN driver has small AMPDU size, and can only get 360Mbps with 866Mbps interface rate in the best lonesome condition. Wifiwave2 is much better , +-600Mbps on 866 Mbps interface rate- Wifi is bidirectional communication.There can only be ONE transmitter in a channel at some point in time!All wifi devices (AP and clients) compete for the right to transmit.- Any busy slow transmitter will consume a lot of air-time in that channel. (Actually reducing the effective speed of all the others, to around it's own slow speed.)- There is potential interference and collisions, requiring retransmissions. Check the CCQ in Mikrotik: % of transmissions that succeeded.- Interference is also with bluetooth, USB3, microwave oven, non-wifi transmitters, etc etc), and also partly overlapping channels.- Waiting for other transmitters to finish has a disturbing range that is typical 8 times the usefull range. (So not for 40 meters, but 320 meters in free field conditions)- Walls and other obstructions will disturb the signal quality. (High MCS will not be possible)2. Once you know now what that one transmitter can do, and what the expected speed can be ... then there are the Mikrotik specifics.- wifiwave2 will not work well on a hAP ac2. The memory available (flash and RAM) are too small.- Mikrotik is not using WMM priorities out of the box in WLAN driver. Using AMPDU is also not set for higher priorities.- CAPsMAN has it's own potential limitations (eg Size of AMPDU in the CAPWAP tunnel used?)- any tuning setting has effect on the performance. Only deviate from the default if you really know why you do it, and you monitor it.

Hi guys, thank you so much for everyone's replies. I hope I'm providing better info with my 2nd post@erlinden, I hope I understood your requirements. Please find below. I'm hoping that the config shows something that might be useful.Problem: When connected to the WiFi, 5ghz in this case, the response time of web sites, web sites take long to load, remote servers that I log into, seems to be "sluggish" and slow to respond upon commands given. It's not as quick to open and respond when I'm connected with an ethernet cable for instance. Some of the laptops will be collected to the 5Ghz network and almost all personal mobile devices are connected to the 2.4Ghz network. Sometimes, the WiFi would be doing great, but most of the time, you'll feel a BIG difference between being connected with an ethernet cable compared to the WiFi.I've also attached a screenshot of the channels for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.Also added speedtest. Which seems to be okay, but user still experience a "slow/sluggish" connection when connected to the WiFi.Would it be better then to replace the hAP ac2 with theRB5009UG+S+IN that gigabyte09 suggested?

If a wired conneciton is fast, then it is not related to the routing part of the router.I also notice that the 2.4GHz radio is broadcasting on channels 1, 3 and 6. In an ideal world (funny in the 2.4GHz context) you would only use channels 1, 6 and 11. Might want to configure frequencies 2412, 2437 and 2462.Some concerns:- the firewall is modded. And I think it is missing some rules (definitely on the forward chain). Is this a public Internet facing device?- sure you want to have so many services publically available (like providing DNS and NTP to the world, assuming it is publically available)?- I notice some asteriks in the config, is this some legacy that hasn't been properly removed?- why do you have IPv6 DNS servers configured while you only use IPv4?

I went ahead and created additional frequencies for 2.4Ghz. I couldn't manually assign it from CAPsMAN, to I'm hoping that this would suffice? See attached.Some concerns:- the firewall is modded.

- I believe so, I know they use VPN accounts for users to remotely connect to the Mikrotik Router located in the office to obtain the Company Public IP. This IP is whitelisted at another company they do work for. However, I've tried creating an account, but when I create the VPN on my Windows machine, it fails. I haven't google'd that much yet with regards to this, but this is one of things I also need to look into. (I hope I've addressed your questions about internet facing device and DNS, NTP?)- I created the asterisks instead of the sensitive data that was located there- I was literally too afraid to delete anything and didn't go looking in all places for configs that I don't use. This router was setup before my time starting here.

You said that sometimes wifi is feeling great and sometimes is sluggish.How many clients are connected to the AP when wifi is "sluggish" ?Maybe there is too many clients on one AP...

Varying wifi performance is normally not visible in the config settings.Wifi is a shared medium, you are influenced by other devices.These very short PING delays in those tests. Over wifi ?Long PING times do indeed make the connection feel slow, very slow, even if the rate is OK.Beware that ...-Mikrotik does not activate WMM if not set in config-Mikrotik does not assign WMM priorities to traffic (video, voice, ...) unless extra FW mangle rules are added. DSCP must be converted to priority in local RouterOS.-For all but lowest WMM priority Mikrotik does not do AMPDU aggregation by default-WMM priority takes the wifi-ether access much faster than the regular (shorter wait time for transmission attempt)-Regular wifi will not get a fair share of air-time if WMM priority is aroundFor the 2.4GHz, avoid the 802.11b setting.  "b" gives 1Mbps beacon speed (30 SSID/AP at 1Mbps overhead will fill all the available air-time just with the beacons)802.11b in one AP, forces other reachable AP's to also work with 1Mbps. There are 1Mbps connections in your sample.

Mikrotik does enable WMM by default on 802.11n/ac.wmm-support (disabled | enabled | required; Default: disabled)	Specifies whether to enable WMM.  Only applies to bands B and G. Other bands will have it enabled regardless of this setting

Yes it is enabled, but out-of-the-box does NOTHING as WMM priority action.Unless you convert DSCP to local RouterOS priority, or do set local RouterOS priority.(That is the WMM setting I did refer to. (Sorry to be confusing))Priority can be set as "dscp high 3 bits" , or it can be set in VLAN or in bridge priority settingUsing DSCP for priority is a newer option in the wifi(wave2) drivers, not in the WLAN drivers.You need something like this:viewtopic.php?t=113094https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... N+priority

At the moment, we have 28 devices connected to the WiFi, Be that via 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz. My laptop would also jump between 2 AP's. Hallway Ap & Blue AP. See attached Floor Layout of the Office. Tuesday's and Thursday's have the least amount of people in the office. But the WiFi still feels slow, as if the internet feels slow. Reponse time of websites are long, takes a few seconds longer for the sites to open compared to being on cable. I even have a space AP that I could install, however, I wasn't sure if this might help and where to put it.I was thinking of move the Blue AP out from behind the corner, behind the door it's currently at and move it to the middle of the Blue Tables.What is the maximum amount of Client's an AP can handle? At the moment the Orange_Green AP carries about 10 clients.I'm also connected to the Blue AP at the moment. But is does then to jump to the Hallway AP when I move around the office with my laptop and stays connected to it.  Rx Signal would be -70 when connected to Hallway AP. When connected to Blue AP, my signal strength is -63. See attached.Thanks again for the helpful insights and especially to you gigabyte091, for contributing so much to this "project" of mine

"b" gives 1Mbps beacon speed (30 SSID/AP at 1Mbps overhead will fill all the available air-time just with the beacons)802.11b in one AP, forces other reachable AP's to also work with 1Mbps. There are 1Mbps connections in your sample.

Hi there bpwl. Thank you so much for contributing to this request for assistance. I really do appreciate that some of your stature would share your knowledge with us.To answer your question, yes. those short pings where when I was connected to the WiFi. I've attached a speedtest I did today as well. You'll notice quite a difference between some of the tests.Thanks for the advice. I'm not entirely sure where to check this, but let me follow your links and if not google on where to change these settings.

> Beware that ...-Mikrotik does not activate WMM if not set in configI just wanted to correct this statement.

Thanks for the correction. You're absolutly right, it is enabled but AFAIK it does not bring the expected wifi priority (short intertransmission delay) . That is something else.I do have questions on WMM and CAPsMAN. Where to set the priority in the case of CAPsMAN? On the controller , or on the CAP with the wifi interface?  Different answer for central delivery and local forwarding could be expected. And if set in the CAPsMAN controller, is that priority then transported over the CAPWAP style (RFC wording) tunnel or not. Is there a field to store that information? In a VLAN there is one at least. Maybe to be checked with Torch or Sniffer to see if the priority is still there.I usually get a remark on Mikrotik performance as "MT is not performing well in crowded environments". WMM priority by others could be to blame. Or is someone or something setting "video" WMM priority on all it's packets, just to perform better in crowded area's. Or is it because video is just in the air? TEAM meeting, security camera, "click and share" wifi link from laptop to projector in meeting room, Chromecast, Miracast, etc etc.Looking into the timing of the sluggish connections, might give a clue on the source of interference.

10 clients on an AP like hAP ac2 is no problem at all. All the clients around , as checked with "Snooper" have to be counted however. "Scan" only shows the AP's emitting beacons. All transmitters compete for air-time in the channel, AP's and clients equally well. Clients that see the AP, but not the other clients will create destructive interference while also talking to the AP, which is listening to another client. 'RTS/CTS' and 'RTS to self' might be considered then.

Now as you've mentioned it. Adding packet priorities for traffic on WiFI CAPsMAN (as there is local forwarding only) must be a PITA! This has to be done by hand and IMHO makes capsman completely obsolete. With wifi-qcom-ac you already need to configure vlans manually on caps, firewall mangle rules for WMM manually as well. CAPsMAN is less a manager, more a little tool for first wifi interface provisioning. That's it. Mikrotik should rename it to RadioMan or something. Would fit better.

Who knows what surprises they are hiding from us... Look at Winbox 4... Maybe they finally make controller... And fix wireless...

1. Upgrade to ROS7 (if haven't) and use ww2 drivers whit new capsman - it has a great impact on wifi performance on these devices.2. As much as you can ditch 2.4ghz band usage, leave it for IoT and legacy devices whit no 5ghz band support.3. Make sure there is no channel overlap, use freq scan to see what AP sees. You have to set them manually.4. Adjust TX power to increase channel reuse and improve roaming. A stations should roam like intended.5. You can setup queues, so speed is distributed equally between stations.6. (most important) Deployment is very important. If a room needs good wifi performance, deploy AP on ceiling in centre of the room, or as close you can get, not in corners, on desks, under desks, behind walls etc. On larger deployment it is very important to keep modulations hi.We use cap acs is school, one classroom can have up to 35 active devices browsing internet, so hardware is capable to do what you need. APs are deployed in every classroom, on total we have 75 APs. Based on RX signal, looks like your stations do have APs in line of sight, that is good, you should see good modulations on 5ghz band and have a at least acceptable user experience.

Hi Everyone. Thank you so much for all the replies received.The company went ahead and bought the RB5009UG+S+IN, I wondered if buying the RB5009UPr+S+IN, wouldn't had been a better option rather, as I was contemplating of connecting the cap's to the RB5009. Not sure if this would have had an effect, compared to being connected to the older D-Link unmanaged switch they are currently connected to? Should this show any kind of improvement on the WiFi? oh and I've read that it's almost impossible to load ww2 on these caps as they have a 15.3MB HDD.

If no VLAN's are involved, the D-Link will do just fine (assuming it has gigabit ports).The cAP ac does handle the wifi-qcom-ac pretty well (in my experience), though I red someone having out of memory problems (therefor a daily reboot was introduced). Haven't seen that problem myself (uptime over a couple of weeks).

Thanks Erlinden. Can you maybe point me in the right direction on how to do this perhaps? Hoping this info might assist?EDIT:I think I was able to do it. I've updated the RouterOS on the AP to 7.13, then I proceed to check for update, which updated 7.13 to 7.15.3(stable), along with it came a wireless package. I'm assuming that this is wifiwave2?

That would be me but that is using 7.16rc package. The issue has been confirmed by MT-staff (strods) so a fix should be coming.I have AC2 (same architecture as cap ac) running 7.15.1 for 65d and counting without issues using wifi-qcom-ac package.As a matter of fact, for a new setup with 7 APs, I ordered yesterday cap AC instead of cap AX simply because of the physical size.I like the square package of cap AC a lot more then those huge AX dishes.And I am planning on first loading wifi-qcom-ac drivers on them before finishing their setup.@JPbarriesfirst upgrade to ROS7 (should go to 7.12 or 7.13, I think)Then upgrade to latest stable (7.15.3 as of writing)Afterwards, remove wireless package, next add wifi-qcom-ac package.After final reboot you should be ready.Everything wifi will have to be reconfigured so make sure to extract first all info related to security settings, ssid to be used, ...

@holvoetn, thanks for all that help! I was able to get the package installed. Who knew that you had to download the individual packet, then upload it into files and then restart the cAPI do have 1 question. Why did I install the wifi-qcom-ac, when I might have chosen the wifiwave2 packet?

Because wave2 package only existed until 7.12. It also was too big to be installed on 16MB flash devices.

Thank you Infabo!Please allow me another question. I'm guessing then that we installed wifi-qcom-ac above wifi-qcom because its smaller and the settings are practically the same?

In a still not perfect world, but better than this one, wifi-qcom-ac would have probably been still called wifi-qcom-ac, but wifi-qcom would probably have been called wifi-qcom-ax.You would have wifiacdevices, and need wifi-qcom-ac, you would have wifiaxdevices, and need wifi-qcom-ax.In this world, we assume that ac means acwhile nothing means currentand current means ax.

Adding to post by @jaclaz: yes, you installed wifi-qcom-ac because it's smaller. And that's exactly the reason for its existence, some ac devices have the tiny 16MB flash (and small 128MB RAM). Previously wifiwave2 package contained all modern hardware drivers (including those from wifi-qcom plus new capsman) and was simply too big for these constrained devices. There are a few ac devices with enough flash and RAM (hAP ac3, Audience, RB4011) and on those it was possible to install and use wifiwave2 even before package split.

Thank you so much mkx!I'm really new to Mikrotik. At my previous company, we actually had the ISP do all these things. I guess this is one of the drawbacks of working in the corporate world. Everyone has designated roles. Now at the new place I'm at (which is a small business), they asked if I wouldn't mind assisting with the network/wifi issues that is plaguing them. Knowing that I didn't have any real-world network experience, I thought I would give it a try and also broaden the little bit of knowledge I have with networks, but let me tell you, it's like a rabbit hole when start going into it.I never knew that even the quality of an ethernet cable could affect your network speeds. CCA vs Copper Core. I always choose the cheaper cable for instance :OBut that aside, I'm so grateful to everyone that weighed in on my posts on the forum. I really do appreciate it. I'm looking forward to getting to work with Mikrotik devices. It might take me a bit of time though
