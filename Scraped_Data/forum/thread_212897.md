Hi everyone...I am looking at setting up my first virtual Routerboard on a VPS. My question is, what is the difference between x86 version of RouterOS and Cloud Hosted Router.I am going to use a Level 4 license. I need to setup a solution so that I can access clients Routers that I manage. ISPs here in South Africa are now all starting to use CG-NAT (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) and this is preventing me from accessing the Routerboards like I used to.So I want to setup a little L2TP network that I can use for doing my job. I have less than 100 Routerboards that I manage, so when I get close to 200 I will happily upgrade to Level 5 license.I did manage to install RouterOS x86 to a Virtual Box instance using the available ISO, and everything I need seems to be there. If this is okay to do my job, then where do I put the license in? "/system license" gives me no option.No Internet traffic will pass through the VPS, it will only be Winbox, API and SSH traffic.TIA
