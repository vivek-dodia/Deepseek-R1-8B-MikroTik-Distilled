Okay, let's dive into a detailed exploration of RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) within MikroTik RouterOS, specifically focusing on a Point-to-Point link scenario, targeting versions 6.48 and 7.x. This guide will be geared towards an expert-level user.

## Scenario Description:

We are establishing a point-to-point link between two MikroTik routers. We need a way to manage these routers remotely, even if the IP link between them fails, or if the management IP address is not available for any other reason. We will use the RoMON protocol to achieve out-of-band management. This configuration assumes that there is a physical Ethernet connection between the two routers. The specific IP subnet that we are configuring a VLAN on, 90.6.166.0/24, is separate from our RoMON link IP addresses.

## Implementation Steps:

Here, we'll provide a step-by-step guide to configure RoMON on two MikroTik routers, Router A, and Router B, using the CLI. Winbox is not explicitly used here, as CLI is the more effective method for detailed expert configuration.

### Router A (Example)

1.  **Step 1: Create VLAN Interface**

    *   **Description**: We need to create a VLAN interface on a physical port to associate with our 90.6.166.0/24 subnet. Let's assume that our physical port connecting the routers is `ether1`.
    *   **Before**: `ether1` is configured with an IP address or no IP address.
    *   **Action**: Create VLAN interface `vlan-90` with VLAN ID `90`. This does not effect existing connectivity if the port has no IP address assigned.
    *   **CLI command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan
        add interface=ether1 name=vlan-90 vlan-id=90
        ```
    *   **After**: `vlan-90` interface is created on `ether1`.
    *   **Expected Effect**: A new virtual network interface, that will allow us to handle 802.1Q tagged frames on the physical link.
    *   **Winbox GUI**: Go to `Interfaces -> VLAN` and click the '+' button and set the values.

2.  **Step 2: Assign IP Address to VLAN Interface**

    *   **Description**: Assign an IP address to the VLAN interface. We will use the address `90.6.166.1/24`.
    *   **Before**: `vlan-90` interface exists, but it doesn't have an IP address configured.
    *   **Action**: Assign IP address `90.6.166.1/24` to interface `vlan-90`.
    *   **CLI command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address
        add address=90.6.166.1/24 interface=vlan-90
        ```
    *   **After**: `vlan-90` interface has the `90.6.166.1/24` IP address assigned.
    *   **Expected Effect**: The interface will be able to communicate with other IP devices on the 90.6.166.0/24 subnet, if configured with a 90 VLAN tag.
    *   **Winbox GUI**: Go to `IP -> Addresses` and click the '+' button, specify the Address and select the interface.

3.  **Step 3: Enable RoMON**

    *   **Description**: Enable and configure RoMON. Let's use a RoMON ID of "point-to-point".
    *   **Before**: RoMON is disabled.
    *   **Action**: Enable RoMON, set the ID, and set the interfaces on which to listen.
    *   **CLI command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon
        set enabled=yes id=point-to-point interfaces=ether1,vlan-90
        ```
    *   **After**: RoMON is enabled with ID `point-to-point` on interfaces `ether1` and `vlan-90`.
    *   **Expected Effect**: RoMON will begin to advertise on the specified interfaces, creating a mesh network. Other devices with the same RoMON ID can be discovered by this router and vice versa.
    *   **Winbox GUI**: Go to `Tools -> RoMON`, click `Enabled`, enter the ID and click interfaces.

### Router B (Example)

Repeat the same process on Router B, with the following modifications:

1.  **Step 1: Create VLAN Interface**
    *   Same command, assuming the physical connection is still `ether1`
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan
        add interface=ether1 name=vlan-90 vlan-id=90
        ```

2.  **Step 2: Assign IP Address to VLAN Interface**
    *   Assign IP `90.6.166.2/24`:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address
        add address=90.6.166.2/24 interface=vlan-90
        ```

3.  **Step 3: Enable RoMON**
    *   Use the same RoMON ID, `point-to-point` for devices to discover each other.
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon
        set enabled=yes id=point-to-point interfaces=ether1,vlan-90
        ```

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here is the complete set of commands for Router A, to be executed in the terminal of the device:
```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=vlan-90 vlan-id=90

/ip address
add address=90.6.166.1/24 interface=vlan-90

/tool romon
set enabled=yes id=point-to-point interfaces=ether1,vlan-90
```

Here is the complete set of commands for Router B, to be executed in the terminal of the device:
```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=vlan-90 vlan-id=90

/ip address
add address=90.6.166.2/24 interface=vlan-90

/tool romon
set enabled=yes id=point-to-point interfaces=ether1,vlan-90
```
**Parameter Explanations:**
| Command | Parameter   | Explanation                                                        |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/interface vlan add`  | interface | The physical interface where the VLAN is created, in our example `ether1`. |
| `/interface vlan add`  | name        | The name of the VLAN interface, can be user defined. |
| `/interface vlan add`  | vlan-id     | The VLAN ID tag.                                     |
| `/ip address add`    | address     | IP address and subnet mask in CIDR notation.            |
| `/ip address add`    | interface   | The interface where the IP address is assigned.         |
| `/tool romon set`      | enabled    | `yes` to enable RoMON, `no` to disable RoMON.         |
| `/tool romon set`      | id        | The RoMON ID to use for discovery and connectivity.    |
| `/tool romon set`      | interfaces  | List of interfaces to be included in the RoMON network. |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **RoMON ID Mismatch:** If the RoMON IDs on the routers don't match, they will not discover each other.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure that the same RoMON ID is configured on all participating routers. Use the command `/tool romon print` to view the current configuration.
*   **Interface Not Enabled/Correct:** RoMON must be enabled on the interface physically connecting the devices, as well as any other link that would be part of the discovery process.
    *   **Solution:** Use the command `/interface print` and ensure both physical and VLAN interfaces are enabled. Add the correct interface in the command `/tool romon set interfaces=...`.
*   **Firewall Rules:** If the firewall is overly restrictive, RoMON packets might be dropped.
    *   **Solution:** Add firewall rules to allow RoMON traffic. RoMON runs on a very specific set of Ethernet types, but to be sure you can use `/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input protocol=udp dst-port=5678` to allow UDP RoMON. You could also consider an input rule to allow UDP and TCP on port 5678, or even to allow traffic on this port from trusted networks or IPs. This specific rule will allow management access to the router.
*   **High CPU Usage:** RoMON can use CPU resources if there are many devices in the RoMON network or if the network topology is complex.
    *   **Solution:** Monitor CPU usage, limit the scope of interfaces using RoMON, or use an active discovery mode to help manage load.
*   **Multiple paths in the mesh causing performance issues:** Multiple RoMON-enabled interfaces can create mesh network that is not easily manageable.
    *   **Solution:** Select only the interfaces that are needed for the mesh network.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Check RoMON Neighbors:** On Router A, use the command `/tool romon monitor` to verify that Router B has been discovered. You should see an entry for Router B and vice-versa. A successful discovery will show an output similar to:
    ```
    /tool romon monitor
    #   ID        ADDRESS   INTERFACE   ACTIVE  DISCOVERY-MODE  DISCOVERY-INTERFACE
    0   ...   00:0C:42:XX:XX:XX   ether1      yes     active           ether1
    1   ...   00:0C:42:YY:YY:YY   ether1     yes     active          ether1
    ```
    If they are not both listed here, verify your configuration. The address will be a layer 2 (MAC) address.
2.  **Connect via RoMON:** Use the MAC address shown to connect to the discovered device via RoMON. Example: `/tool romon connect <discovered-address>`. You are now able to log into the second device, and execute commands as if you were directly connected to the device, using the command-line terminal.
3.  **Ping Via RoMON:** Once connected, try to ping Router A from Router B using its RoMON address. You can ping from `/tool romon ping <ROMON-Address-of-Router-A>`.
4.  **Winbox Connection:** Once connected to the router via a RoMON session, open Winbox and try to connect to the router using its RoMON MAC address.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Active Discovery Mode:** RoMON can also use a mode where the devices don't need to constantly advertise. This might help to manage resources in larger networks. This is enabled per interface.
*   **Multiple RoMON IDs:** You can use multiple RoMON IDs to create isolated management networks.
*   **Security:** RoMON is not an encrypted protocol, and should not be used in untrusted environments, or should be secured with firewall rules. If not secured RoMON, traffic can be captured and the RoMON ID can be discovered, and another device can connect as a client to your network.
*   **Management IP Addressing:** RoMON can be a good method to reach your devices even if the IP management network is non-responsive. It is very useful for devices in remote locations.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

RoMON functionality doesn't have dedicated REST API endpoints, as the API is focused on configuration and not the "operational" or "discovery" aspect of the protocol. However, RoMON settings can be retrieved and modified via the API through generic configuration access.

*   **Retrieve RoMON Configuration:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** `/tool/romon`
    *   **Request Method:** `GET`
    *   **Example Payload:** (None)
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
         [
           {
                "enabled": "true",
                "id": "point-to-point",
                "interfaces": "ether1,vlan-90"
            }
        ]
        ```
*   **Enable RoMON:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** `/tool/romon`
    *   **Request Method:** `PATCH`
    *   **Example Payload:**
        ```json
          {
            "enabled": "true"
          }
       ```
    *   **Example Response:**
       ```json
         [
           {
                "enabled": "true",
                "id": "point-to-point",
                "interfaces": "ether1,vlan-90"
            }
        ]
        ```
*   **Modify RoMON ID:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** `/tool/romon`
    *   **Request Method:** `PATCH`
    *   **Example Payload:**
       ```json
          {
            "id": "new-romon-id"
          }
       ```
    *   **Example Response:**
      ```json
         [
           {
                "enabled": "true",
                "id": "new-romon-id",
                "interfaces": "ether1,vlan-90"
            }
        ]
        ```
*   **Error Handling:** Errors will be returned by the MikroTik API in the standard JSON format, such as code 400, 401, 404 or 500.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Isolate Management Networks:** Use a separate VLAN for management access, especially if the IP networks are routable in other parts of your network.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to RoMON only from trusted networks or IP addresses.
*   **Do Not Use Default RoMON ID:** Choose a non-default RoMON ID that is hard to guess.
*   **Monitor:** Keep track of changes to the RoMON configuration, to detect unauthorized access.
*   **Consider RoMON's Nature:** Remember that RoMON is not an encrypted protocol and is vulnerable to passive and active attacks in an insecure environment.
*   **Use Encrypted Alternatives:** Use other more secure means of connection, like a VPN, if possible.
*   **Do not expose on the internet:** RoMON should *never* be exposed on the internet. The only place RoMON should be enabled is on physical devices you have physical control over.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Improve Firewall Rules:** We could add more granular firewall rules to allow traffic only from specific IP addresses or subnets using source IP based filtering.
*   **Script the Configuration:** It would be better to create a script to apply the configuration, to make deployment faster and more reliable.
*   **Multiple RoMONs:** Using multiple RoMONs with different scopes is more secure.
*   **Limit RoMON Interfaces**: Only add the interfaces that are physically or directly connected. Over exposing interfaces can allow unauthorized access into the RoMON network.
*   **Monitoring:** More elaborate monitoring strategies could be used to detect issues with the RoMON network or attempts to use the discovery process for malicious purposes.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) is a MikroTik-specific protocol that allows you to connect to MikroTik routers for management purposes even if they do not have an IP address or if you do not have access to their IP network. RoMON utilizes the MAC address, operating on layer 2, and can be routed by other MikroTik routers using the same RoMON ID. Each device on the RoMON network can discover other devices on the same RoMON network.

RoMON is very useful for initial configuration, troubleshooting, and out-of-band management. Once a RoMON connection is established, you can open a remote terminal or connect via Winbox as if you were directly connected to the physical device.

RoMON is a layer 2 protocol, meaning it does not operate on the IP layer. Instead, RoMON operates on ethernet frames, and the discovery is based on the MAC address of the devices. The protocol has a very specific set of Ethernet type values.

Key features of RoMON are the RoMON ID, which is how you specify the management network. When enabling RoMON, you define the ID and the interfaces to monitor for RoMON packets.

RoMON is useful for various reasons:
* **Out-of-band management**: You don't need IP addresses to connect to devices.
* **Troubleshooting**: RoMON works even when IP networks are down.
* **Initial Configuration**: Enables the configuration of devices without pre-configured IP networks.
* **Remote Management**: Access to remote devices without needing a VPN or other IP management network.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

There are trade-offs between different configurations and settings regarding RoMON:

*   **Single RoMON ID vs Multiple RoMON IDs:** Using a single RoMON ID simplifies management but can become a security risk. It exposes all devices to each other in the network. Using multiple RoMON IDs can segment the network but can be harder to manage.
*   **All Interfaces vs Selected Interfaces:** Enabling RoMON on all interfaces makes devices discoverable from all connections. However, that can lead to unauthorized access if a device is connected to an untrusted network. Enabling it on selected interfaces can limit the scope of RoMON to known physical connections.
*   **Active vs Passive Discovery Modes:** The active mode makes devices discoverable faster but can consume more CPU resources, especially if there are many devices in the network. The passive discovery mode can reduce resource usage, but the time to discovery will be longer.
*   **Using a Default RoMON ID vs A Hard to Guess RoMON ID:** A default ID is very easy to discover, while a hard to guess ID can make it harder to discover your devices. However, this does not guarantee the security of the network, as a determined actor can find the RoMON ID.
*   **Not Configuring Firewall Rules:** No firewall rules will allow any device in the local network to access the management network. With firewall rules you can define what traffic should be allowed to access this network and from where.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The above examples are compatible with RouterOS versions 6.48 and 7.x. The commands and parameters used are the same for both versions. However, pay close attention to differences if you are using a RouterOS 6.x branch, and version 7.x, as some configurations might be different, or have an altered parameter.

This comprehensive documentation should provide you with the necessary information and guidance to implement and understand RoMON within your MikroTik infrastructure. Remember to always test your configurations in a lab environment before deploying them in a production network.
