Boa noite, estou com um problema bem estranho com uma CRS, ela esta taxando erro somente e uma interface " Tx Drop", já foi feito a troca do cordão, Gbic e porta. Porem ela taxa " Tx Drop" sentindo a Borda apenas.Teriam alguma ideia ?.Seria algum problema na CRS ?Good evening, I have a very strange problem with a CRS, it is only reporting an error and a "Tx Drop" interface, the cord, Gbic and port have already been replaced. However, it only reports "Tx Drop" when sensing the Edge. Do you have any ideas? Could it be a problem with the CRS?

Or would just updating to version 7.16.2 solve the problem?But send me the link with the tutorial because if, after the update, there is a "Tx Drop" charge, I can do it by following the tutorial.
