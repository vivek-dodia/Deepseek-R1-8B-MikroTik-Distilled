Hi guys, I have been using the WinBox app for Android for years on various RBs of different models. I have always noticed a big annoyance or bug present on WinBox Android (Samsung S24+ but also other smartphones with different versions have the problem). If I enter my RBs via Android I noticed that some settings appear completely empty as if they were not set. If I enter with WinBox 3 on Windows everything is perfect. An example that happened yesterday.. If I enter Wifi>Access List from Android I do not see the "signal range" value which appears completely empty. From Windows everything is ok. This happens on various RBs. I use WinBox Android more for monitoring than to set up a RB from scratch but this way it is not at all reliable... Am I the only one with this problem?

I concur with your findings,  It`s a BUG....I was able to reproduce the Error with the latest RouterOS 7.17 Stable installed on the Devicesand the Mikrotik-App version 1.4.4 installed on Andoid.
