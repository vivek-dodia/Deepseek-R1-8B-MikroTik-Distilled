## Initial Question

From a bit of reading, you need to turn network Off, which means it becomes a switch and DHCP client I believe the setting selection is (Off) Bridge Mode.Then you can use all ports as switch ports.Not sure about wireless settings nor if the time capsule is capable of reading vlan tags...........Not looking good so far."...The conclusion: guest network traffic is tagged VLAN 1003, while "internal" traffic is simply untagged. Whether or not AirPort Extremes always use VLAN 1003 is unknown, but now you know how to look and see in your own setup... if you wanted to do that. Okay, I realize that I am probably literally the only person out there who wanted to do that".".................The issue is that Apple uses VLAN 1003 tagged on the Airport, BUT they actually do NOT support using a managed switch with the same VLAN Tag!! I was seriously baffled at what I found. They have said they only support the roaming configuration with Airports connected to each other via the built-in LAN ports, OR an unmanaged switch. They flat-out do not support using a high-end managed switch tagging and passing the traffic. In fact, in reading the Apple forums they admit the problem and refuse to fix the bug."In other words, I am not convinced you can have TWO separate networks running through the time capsule, either you have the non tagged Normal LAN OR the tagged guest vlan.You may want to test it this way.Bridge on MT routerLets say ETHER2 goes to a time capsuleVLAN20 is HOme users (for wired or wireless use, home is home)VLAN1003 is Guest usersBridge for your MT network is called BridgeHomeNote both vlan20 and vlan1003 are identified with BridgeHome as the interface, then the usual 4 settings of, IP address, IP Pool, DHCP-Server, and DHCP-Server Network.We will try and setup a hybrid port scenario.interface bridge portadd bridge=HomeBridge interface=ether2 frame-type=accept all pvid=20/interface bridge vlanadd bridge=HomeBridge tagged=HomeBridge, ether2 vlan-ids=1003add bridge=HomeBridge tagged=HomeBridge untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=20Then see if the home apple user can get an IP and internet connectivityThen see if the guest apple user can get an IP and internet connectivityThe problem is I have my doubts the time capsule can handle both untagged traffic (vlan20) and tagged traffic 1003 at the same time, but you wont know until you test it.By untagged the router takes any traffic from apple without tags and applies vlan20 tags to it and then when it sends this traffic back to the time capsule it strips the vlan20 tags first.
