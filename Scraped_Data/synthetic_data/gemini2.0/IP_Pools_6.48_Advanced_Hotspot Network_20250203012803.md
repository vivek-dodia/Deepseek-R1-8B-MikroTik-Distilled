# MikroTik RouterOS: Advanced IP Pool Management for Hotspot Network

## 1. Configuration Scenario & Specific MikroTik Requirements

*   **Scenario:** We are building a Hotspot network using MikroTik RouterOS where users will obtain IP addresses from a specific pool. The Hotspot will be attached to a bridge interface (`bridge-19`).
*   **Subnet:**  149.21.139.0/24 (256 addresses, usable range 149.21.139.1 - 149.21.139.254)
*   **Interface:** `bridge-19` is the logical interface connected to the physical networks, on which the hotspot will provide IP addresses. We assume this bridge is already correctly setup connecting the required physical ports.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Dynamic IP assignment through an IP Pool.
    *   Hotspot configuration tied to the specified subnet and bridge interface.
    *   Security best practices for the Hotspot.
    *   Illustrate advanced features like IP Pool management and its integration with the DHCP server.
    *   Detailed explanations of each command and its effect.
    *   Troubleshooting scenarios and diagnostics.
    *   Implementation using both CLI and Winbox interfaces.
    *   REST API examples of related actions.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

### 2.1.  Basic Setup: Bridging and IP Addressing (Pre-requisite)

*   **Assumptions:** `bridge-19` already configured and connected to the relevant physical ports.
*   **Note:** In a production environment, it's good practice to isolate bridge interface from management traffic.
    *   For simplicity of this demonstration, we will not be creating separate vlans.
*   **Winbox:**  Interface -> Bridge, check that bridge-19 exists and has the desired ports assigned.

### 2.2. Configuring the IP Pool

*   **Objective:** Create an IP Pool that defines the range of addresses available for assignment on the bridge interface and hotspot setup
*   **CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=hotspot-pool ranges=149.21.139.2-149.21.139.254
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `/ip pool add`:  Command to add a new IP Pool.
    *   `name=hotspot-pool`:  Assigns the name "hotspot-pool" to this pool.
    *   `ranges=149.21.139.2-149.21.139.254`: Defines the usable range of IP addresses within the subnet to be assigned, excluding 149.21.139.1 (typically reserved for the gateway or router).

*   **Winbox:** IP -> Pools -> `Add` and fill in the same details.

### 2.3. Configuring the IP Address on the Bridge Interface

*   **Objective:** Assign an IP address to the `bridge-19` interface from our subnet. This address serves as the gateway for clients in the 149.21.139.0/24 network.
*   **CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=149.21.139.1/24 interface=bridge-19 network=149.21.139.0
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `/ip address add`:  Command to add a new IP address.
    *   `address=149.21.139.1/24`: Assigns the IP address 149.21.139.1 with a /24 subnet mask to the interface.
    *   `interface=bridge-19`:  Specifies the bridge interface on which to assign the IP.
    *   `network=149.21.139.0`: Specifies the network address of the assigned IP for correct routing and subnet configurations.

*   **Winbox:** IP -> Addresses -> `Add` and fill in the same details.

### 2.4. Setting up the DHCP Server

*   **Objective:** Enable automatic IP configuration for the hotspot network users using the defined IP Pool.
*   **CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=hotspot-pool disabled=no interface=bridge-19 lease-time=1d name=hotspot-dhcp
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=149.21.139.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=149.21.139.1
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `/ip dhcp-server add`: Creates a new DHCP server instance.
    *   `address-pool=hotspot-pool`:  Specifies that DHCP will allocate addresses from the defined `hotspot-pool`.
    *   `disabled=no`: Enables the DHCP server.
    *   `interface=bridge-19`: Sets the interface on which the server is active.
    *   `lease-time=1d`: Sets the IP lease time to 1 day.
    *   `name=hotspot-dhcp`: Names the DHCP server.
    *   `/ip dhcp-server network add`: Configures the DHCP network settings, such as DNS and gateway.
    *   `address=149.21.139.0/24`: The network address of the DHCP server.
    *   `dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Specifies Google public DNS servers for the users of this DHCP.
    *   `gateway=149.21.139.1`:  Sets the gateway address as our RouterOS bridge address.

### 2.5. Hotspot Configuration (Simplified Example)

*   **Objective:** Configure a basic Hotspot server that will use the created IP pool and dhcp server.
*   **CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/ip hotspot profile
add address-pool=hotspot-pool html-directory=hotspot login-by=http-pap name=hotspot-profile
/ip hotspot setup
    interface=bridge-19
    profile=hotspot-profile
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `/ip hotspot profile add`: Create a new hotspot profile to be used with the hotspot server.
    *   `address-pool=hotspot-pool`: The pool used to obtain ip addresses.
    *   `html-directory=hotspot`: Used for the hosted login pages (usually not needed unless using custom pages).
    *   `login-by=http-pap`: Set the login method to the default login by http with plain-text password (not recommended for production)
    *   `name=hotspot-profile`:  Name for the profile.
    *   `/ip hotspot setup`: The hotspot setup wizard.

*   **Winbox:** IP -> Hotspot -> Profiles -> `Add`, and then IP -> Hotspot -> Setup. Fill in the same data in each section.

### 2.6. Basic Firewall Rules for Hotspot Users

*   **Objective:** Ensure internet access for hotspot clients.
*   **CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=pppoe-out1
/ip firewall filter
add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related
add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=pppoe-out1`: NAT rule to masquerade traffic from the hotspot network out to the internet.
        *   **Note:** Change out-interface to your wan interface. It is important to ensure this is the outbound interface for your internet connection.
    *   `/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related`: Allows traffic from previously established connections and related traffic.
    *   `/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid`:  Drops invalid connections.

*   **Winbox:** IP -> Firewall -> NAT, then IP -> Firewall -> Filter Rules.

### 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands

```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Pitfalls:**
    *   **Overlapping IP Pools:** Accidentally assigning overlapping IP ranges, leading to address conflicts.
    *   **Incorrect Interface Selection:** Applying DHCP to the wrong interface.
    *   **Misconfigured DNS or Gateway:** Incorrect DNS servers or gateways, breaking Internet connectivity for clients.
    *   **Firewall Blocking DHCP:** Firewall rules blocking DHCP traffic, often on the forward chain.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **`/ip dhcp-server lease print`:** Checks active leases, identifying if clients get IPs or conflicts.
    *   **`/ip firewall filter print`:** Reviews firewall rules, especially on the forward chain.
    *   **`/ip address print`:**  Verifies the router's IP addresses.
    *   **`/interface monitor-traffic bridge-19`:** Check if data traffic is flowing in the selected bridge.
    *   **`/tool torch interface=bridge-19`:**  Captures and displays real-time traffic information.
    *   **`/system resource print`:** Check system resources for any memory or cpu limitations.
*   **Error Scenario:**
    *   **Scenario:** Clients failing to get IP addresses.
    *   **Check:** DHCP server status (`/ip dhcp-server print`), IP Pool availability (`/ip pool print`), and firewall rules blocking DHCP traffic (on the forward chain).
    *   **Fix:** Ensure the DHCP server is enabled, the pool has available IPs, and firewall rules don't block UDP ports 67/68.

## 5. Verification and Testing

*   **Ping:** Check network connectivity from the router to clients and vice versa.
    *   `ping 149.21.139.x` from the router to the client to test connectivity.
    *   `ping 149.21.139.1` from the client to the router to test connectivity.
*   **Traceroute:** Trace the route to a known external IP to verify NAT functionality.
    *   `traceroute 8.8.8.8` from the client.
*   **Torch:** Monitor real-time traffic on the interface.
    *   `/tool torch interface=bridge-19` and check for DHCP traffic.
*   **Client Testing:**  Connect a device to the hotspot network and verify it gets an IP from the 149.21.139.0/24 subnet and has internet access.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features and Limitations

*   **IP Pool Limitations:**
    *   Each pool is bound to IPv4 or IPv6.
    *   Pools only define ranges; they don't handle network configuration. That's why we need DHCP server or other IP management tools.
*   **Address Lists:** Use `/ip firewall address-list` for advanced management of IP addresses (e.g., blocking or allowing specific addresses). Address lists can be used in firewall, routing and dhcp configuration.
*   **Hotspot User Profiles:**  Control bandwidth, uptime and other user parameters per user, utilizing hotspot user profiles.
*   **DHCP Advanced Options:** Customize DHCP options like DHCP Option 82 or other specific settings.
*   **Multiple IP Pools:** Set multiple IP pools if needed on a single interface, useful for more advanced cases.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

*   **Objective:**  Use the REST API to create and manage IP Pools.

*   **Note:** The REST API must be enabled on your router. Enable it by navigating to `/ip service` and turning on the `api-ssl` or `api` option.

*   **Creating a new IP Pool (POST Method):**

    *   **Endpoint:** `https://<your_router_ip>/rest/ip/pool`

    *   **Method:** DELETE
    *   **Expected Response (204 No Content):** No content is returned.

## 8. In-depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik's bridge interface allows you to combine multiple physical interfaces into one logical interface. This is crucial in our Hotspot setup because we want to combine all the physical ports of the network into a single interface for DHCP and Hotspot services.
*   **Routing:**  While not explicit in the basic configuration here, routing in MikroTik is fundamental. The `gateway` parameter in DHCP tells the clients the destination IP of the router for external traffic. The `srcnat` in firewall also enable correct routing for these IP addresses.
*   **Firewall:**  The firewall protects the router and network. By setting up NAT, we allow internal clients to initiate traffic while preventing external traffic from directly reaching internal IPs (unless specifically allowed).

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Secure Access:**
    *   Disable default admin login.
    *   Use strong passwords.
    *   Restrict access to management interfaces (e.g., Winbox, Web).
    *   Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS).
*   **Firewall Rules:**
    *   Implement strict firewall rules, especially limiting access from the outside.
    *   Use address lists to group IPs for easier management of security policies.
*   **Hotspot Security:**
    *   Use HTTPS for hotspot login pages.
    *   Avoid plain text authentication (HTTP PAP). Opt for CHAP if available or other secure methods.
    *   Employ walled garden to control the access of the user before login.
*   **System Updates:** Always keep RouterOS updated with the latest stable version.
