Hello,I'm facing issue that few Wireless devices which i have on floor 1 - Master DHCP Router Wifi (AP-A) are time to time connect to the Slave AP on Floor 0 - router Wifi (AP-B) and it leads to weak / poor signal or complete disconnect from Wireless network. Even i need to restart those clients to connect again.So instead of putting all clients MACs on AP-B as White List - "Wireless Tables - Access list"Can i set "Black List" for few clients?So i can be sure that those few clients stay only on AP-A.Thanks

Depends on which wireless package respectively menu you are using. If it's the Wireless menu, it can be done through the connect list:Code:Select all/interfacewireless connect-listaddinterface="wifi_interface"connect=nomac-address="mac_address"If the WiFi interfaces are in the Wifiwave2 or WiFi menu, then the blocking rule would be set up in the access list:Code:Select all/interfacewifi access-listaddmac-address="mac_address"action=reject

Thanks for suggestion.Main Router 1st AP - hAP AX3The 2nd AP is - CRS125-24G-1S-2HnD (so i assume no Wifiwave2 support)To be honest i haven't really looked yet into the new changes Wireless / Wifiwave2 changes (i believe since 7.10+)Code:Select all/interfacewireless connect-listaddinterface="wifi_interface"connect=nomac-address="mac_address"Here i'm adding new / 2nd Wifi interface let's say wlan2 and i will list MACs which won't be able to connect?Or i will use it on "wlan1" with an extra rule?Code:Select all/interfacewireless connect-listaddinterface="wlan1"connect=nomac-address="mac_address"

Seems like this did the trickCode:Select all/interfacewireless connect-listaddinterface="wlan1"connect=nomac-address="mac_address"What I've realized now i could also add some "Signal Strength Range" limit (i believe i read about it somewhere)So if it's weaker then XX devices wouldn't connect, so perhaps this way i don't need to set it for each MAC...right?

Yes, it could be done also like that but you'll have to setup the limit most probably based on trial and error

Coming back to this topic, even I thought for some time that is working...is not and the Devices are still connecting / disconnectingThis lead to a state that the Device will not connect anymore anywhere and I need to restart it.w1.pngAny clue what else could completely ignore the 2nd AP with weaker signal?w2.pngThanks
