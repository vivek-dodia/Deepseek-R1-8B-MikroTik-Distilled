## Initial Question
CCR2116-12G-4S routers Webfig skin does not work at all with v7.17 (stable). The file is present in the right place (skins/skinname.json) but cannot be selected via the System/User/Groups menu. ---

## Response 1
I did some quick tests in the LAB, but wasn`t able to reproduce the Issue....Can you maybe provide the skin.json file ? ---
