```
:put[:pick $ipaddress0[:find $ipaddress"/"]]
```

```
:setipaddress[:pick $ipaddress0[:find $ipaddress"/"]]
```

No, that didn't work for me, I tried the wiki example.This line is being ignored:Code:Select allThe solution was to set the variable againCode:Select all

```
:globalipaddress10.1.101.1/24:set$ipaddress[:pick $ipaddress0[:find $ipaddress"/"]]
```

Is like you do not know scripting,":put" simply write on terminal some text,if you must "put" the result inside a variable, is obvious than you must use set.And also on CORRECT way (the $ before ipaddress after set command):Code:Select all
