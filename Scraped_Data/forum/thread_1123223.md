Hi guys,I'm experiencing issues with my TV service from Movistar Spain and the ax3.I have 1Gb symmetric fiber connection, with phone and TV service.As you know, Movistar Spain works with a Triple VLAN setup. VLAN 6 for data, VLAN 2 for TV and VLAN 3 for phone.I have my ax3 setup accordingly, following an excellent script from adslzone. I've created a virtual SSID for the IPTV only with Multicast enhancer. Also tested with one SSID only. No matter what I try, there are video cuts and fast pixelations while playing live channels. VOD works good.I have my TV box connected via Wifi, as I have the router in first floor. Tested via Netflix app in TV box and it receive about 100Mbps that should be more than ennough.With my old Asus RT-AC68U, that is also compatible with Movistar Triple Play, there's no video cuts or pixelations, so the issue is on the MT side.Any ideas? I run out of ideas now...My full setup:Code:Select all# 2024-05-11 14:36:38 by RouterOS 7.14.3

It not working at all be easier problem...  And multicast with AX drivers, I'm less familar.But I'd add the multicast-enhance=enabled to the parent 5Ghz interface as well.  The docs are unclear if a child SSID can set that independent of the parent.  But I don't think it hurt your normal LAN traffic, so adding multicast-enhance=enabled to wifi1 should be easy thing to try.I suppose you can try disabled multicast-enhance=disable, to see what happens... but in 802.11ac world that goes to basic rate.  And I suspect that's what may be going with the dropped frames (i.e. multicast-enhance=enabled is not working), since 6Mb/s likely not enough for high-def movies over multicast.

I’ve tried with only the master 5G without slave created and same issues. I think I tried multicast off at first, but will take a look again.

You have the RTSP helper, which I believe is critical for Movistar (/ip firewall service-port set rtsp disabled=no)... so it's not that.There is not a lot of detail on multicast-enhance, so really hard to know here.One thing is you may want to enable the querier=yes on the bridge in /routing/igmp-proxy/interface, since I'm not sure you have one elsewhere.  I cannot say whether that the issue or not (since packet loss seems like multicast going at basic rate wi-fi problem...), but another thing to try here.

Also, I'm not sure quick-leave=yes is needed in the IGMP settings.  Perhaps it has a bad interaction with AX drivers, dunno.  Anyway, another thing to try.

I’ll try to activate the querier and see how it goes.Related to quick-leave, I tested deactivating it yesterday and also had the issue.

Any ideas?Querier is active. It’s cutting all the time. Tested again with Asus and working like a champ. No cuts.

Seems that all options I test doesn’t work. Put the Asus back and it’s perfect.Opened a ticket with support 6 days ago, no response.Maybe I’ll need to return the ax3, but I’m not happy with that.

Connect tv over eth and start testing again. We don't know problem come from routeros settings or wifi itself.If you get good result on eth shift to wifi and focus only to it.

Ok, just tested with the TV Box connected directly to an eth port on the ax3.I also saw some pixelations and a microcut, in an hour or so...SO there are also problems wired.Here's my actual config:Code:Select all# 2024-05-18 18:11:52 by RouterOS 7.15rc3

Boy I would have bet money is was something in the wifi-qcom drivers... cable kinda eliminates that theory...There just not a lot of knobs to turn here.  Only other one that effect a wired and wireless is the bridge MC cache:/interface bridge set bridge multicast-router=permanentCannot say if it help... but one more thing to try.  It's just strange that's drops stuff/slow/etc...  seem like it just won't work if something is wrong...Google turned up this on Movistar looks from a pure Linux POV:https://www.luispa.com/linux/2014/10/05 ... linux.htmlBut at quick glance, you're doing all/most of that in RouterOS style.

Just tested the permanent setting, same issue. I have tested everything. Maybe it’s a hardware issue on my unit. I just asked Amazon for return. Maybe I’ll buy another ax3 to see how it goes.

It is very unlikely that something like this would be related to a defect in your ax3 and would be fixed by returning it and ordering another one...(I feel for the webshops that get these returns, get devices back as "defective" and have to write off on that.  And I feel for myself as I have to pay for that via a surcharge on every device that I buy from such webshops)

Yo.With the TV on wired, can you send the current configuration as well as the following outputs? ReplaceCode:Select all/interface/ethernet/monitor [find name=ether1] once

/interface/bridge/mdb/printAlso, you referred to a page in Spanish documenting the configuration, can you post the link to it?

There are many folks that are really good in MT. I just apply the ISP config on to the default settings. The one for my ISP is Movistar Triple Play (RouterOS >= 7.5). Its the 7th setup on the thread.https://foro.adslzone.net/mikrotik.199/ ... v7.580707/

Up to you. If you are game, we can try to go to the bottom of it.Thx for the link, opening and reading now.Ok, if you can help, I prefer to solve the issue and nor returning. We tested everything and got bored of testing everything without success, but open to more help. I wrote MT support 7 days ago and got no response. It’s really strange, because I put the Asus back and everything is perfect again.I’ll do that tests and will let you know here.

OK. First thing, let's change the autonegotiation to only attempt 1Gb/s: in some cases 2.5Gb/s may raise issues.Can you issue the following command? This may interrupt your connectivity for a second.Code:Select all/interface/ethernet/set [find name=ether1] advertise=10M-baseT-half,10M-baseT-full,100M-baseT-half,100M-baseT-full,1G-baseT-fullYou have issues with the IPTV. Have you noticed any issue with watching videos on the computer? For example Youtube video quality dropping for a short moment then coming back up?

Even viewing content that is not live on the TV Box, like Netflix, or VOD content from the ISP, doesn’t have issues, there are zero cuts.

I also think that maybe multicast-enhance on Wifi isn’t working really good, because on Wifi there are many many image cuts, and cuts are longer, like 5seconds.I refuse to think that a 10yo Asus can do it better than the great ax3, but I’m starting to do it.

Yeah I'm not convinced everything multicast is 100% on RouterOS.   But without delving into packet trace, hard to know.  And Movistar does some specific things based on many years of reports here that don't make it simplier.  FWIW, the RTSP proxy support was added largely for Movistar AFAIK.And /routing/igmp-proxy has been known the problematic.  And AX driver's multicast-enhance=enabled is relatively new.I suggested this earlier.  Disable the /routing/igmp-proxy, and use the "Bridge IGMP/MLD snooping" method for IGMP proxying.  Seehttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/pages/vi ... d=59277403AFAIK, you don't need the full /igmp-proxy features, since you only have ONE path.  And the bridge imp/mld method should suffice.  Perhaps the AX driver, even if not uses for TV, still "interfere" the /routing/igmp-proxy — everything is on the bridge.

Yeah I'm not convinced everything multicast is 100% on RouterOS.If I disable IGMP Proxy, the TV doesn't work.That's to be expected since you don't have a IGMP querier enabled when /routing/igmp-proxy is disabled.Essentially, the long page about "Bridge IGMP/MLD" essentially boils down to:Code:Select all/interface/bridge bridge set igmp-snooping=yes multicast-querier=yesSo when you disable the IGMP Proxy, you loose the IGMP querier.  So I think you missed the "multicast-querier=yes" part when testing it.

Says no connection.Maybe revisiting MT after some time if Multicast is fixed will be the best option.

Yeah perhaps.  About all I have is you might want to update your case with Mikrotik that you also tried the bridge igmp method too.  That actually should have worked in your case IMO....  Maybe not fix the packet loss, but work.Maybe Mikrotik can search their Jira for another case where Movistar setup that's working, dunno... but someone else has to have this working in Spain.   As I said, this "triple play" has been a topic numerous time in the forum.

Hi !Im risking that my reply will be booked as "stupid" because i dont know how Movistar services are working, but since nothing helped, ill take that risk...My story :I have IPTV and internet in my "second" location from Telekom. They have some cheap end device which you are forced to use (because of their internal network authentification etc...) and you can at least let turn off all internal services (like dhcp, wireless) and hook your router after it (dialing with PPPoE). The difference is maybe, that this device has dedicated port 4 for IPTV and port 1 for internet/PPPoE, which were connected to my MT Router. Long story short, i have to transfer internet and iptv via 1cable from MT router to different room, to hook this cable to MT switch and divide it there to SetTopBox (IPTV) and PC (internet). How you do this ? Of course, VLAN...My result was the same as yours ! But what works now third year without any issues is EOiP tunnel. I configured "one side" of tunnel on MT router for the port where IPTV gets "in", and done the same as "second side" on MT switch for the port where STB is connected.Again, i dont know what is the infrastructure and options for Movistar, but from IPTV perspective VLAN never worked for me, and as i mentioned, i have this setup 3+ years.

I have a decoder plugged to the LAN 4 port of the Asus, and another one connected via Wifi. All running perfectly.

Hi guys,An update.Seems that we are facing two different issues here.1. Long cuts when viewing live TV channels while TV Box is connected via wifi to the ax3/ax2. They are like 4-5 seconds long.It’s something with Mikrotik wifi, because if I disable both wifi interfaces, and connect my old Asus AC68 as an AP to an eth port, the cuts never come back. Tested against many different channels, changing countries, everything…2. Fast pixelations every now and then. They are fast, sound doesn’t cut, only image pixelation for less than a second.Happens also when connected via eth cable, not only wifi. Again, if I put my old Asus as a router behind the ONT (not using the Mikrotik at all), there are no pixelation at all.

Best to put the Asus router into service and get rid of the ax3. or is there anything wrong with the Asus?

Best to put the Asus router into service and get rid of the ax3. or is there anything wrong with the Asus?The Asus is totally fine after 10 years of 24/7 operation. Just wanted to use Mikrotik as I liked it a lot. But something in the code/hardware is wrong or incompatible with how the ISP  TV works.

A question, to test another thing.I’ve read this article:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... N+priorityI understand that for ax band, WMM is on by default, but I need a mangle rule to set priority.If I use Torch on WAN port, I can see that the IGMP packets for TV come with DSCP 48, and the multicast UDP packets with DSCP 40.So, I need this rule?add action=set-priority chain=postrouting comment="Set priority for WMM" new-priority=\from-dscp-high-3-bits passthrough=yesThis will work for WMM? Or I need to set the qos-classifier in the wifi interface to dscp-high-3-bits?

So, I need this rule?Do you carry other traffic (other than IPTV streams) over same AP? If yes, then WMM/QoS may help. If not, then it won't help.The way QoS in general works is to proritize traffic, waiting in egress queue (or actually queueS). It can't do anything if queues are not populated ... and it can't do much if transmissions get stalled due to external factors (e.g. WiFi interference).

"qos-classifier (dscp-high-3-bits | priority)dscp-high-3-bits - interface will transmit data packets using a WMM priority equal to the value of the 3 most significant bits of the IP DSCP field"https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ...

So are we down to the wi-fi where it cuts, or was wired ethernet also still a problem?The various release posts are littered with general wi-fi problems, IDK if releated.  But ax wi-fi and multicast, the chance of a bug goes up.

But ax wi-fi and multicast, the chance of a bug goes up.Wired, no long cuts, but fast pixelations here and there. I know about more people in a spanish forum that have the pixelation issues with Mikrotik.If I disable ax2 wifi and connect my Asus as an AP, long cuts disappear, but fast pixelation still present.Seems that we face two different issues. Long cuts using wifi, and fast pixelations.

I have some news…I commented the issue of the image cuts on a Telegram Mikrotik group of Spanish users, and I was suggested to increase the value of L2 MTU of all ethernet ports.I saw that by default the L2 MTU of all ports was 1568. I increased them to 1592. Not sure that it’s 100% solved, but for sure it’s much better. I’m testing it right now and will need a few days to be sure, but before the cuts were so frequent and I haven’t see any yet in about 1,5-2 hours of watching.About the fast pixelations…not sure, need to test more.What values should I put in L2 to be sure? About L3 MTU, My ISP uses PPPoE, and I can't put 1500 on the PPPoE, so it's 1492. All ether are 1500.

Any L2 ethernet frame size larger than the standard 1500 bytes (excluding the header) on your local network requiresallother devices on the same network to have the same size. L3/WAN (PPPoE) is a different story.https://www.packetstreams.net/2018/07/t ... 3-mtu.html

If L2MTU was 1500, since there are VLANs here, that actually be a problem.  But that is NOT the default...What was the "L2MTU" before you changed it?  The value of "MTU" is still 1500, correct?

From a default configuration, the ax2 set a L2 MTU of 1568. Double checked applying defconf again.Believe you.  But it is kinda bizarre that L2 MTU did anything here.  The VLAN adds 4 bytes, so L2MTU needs to be large enough for that - so 1568 is plenty.  Why 1592 L2MTU works... I just dunno whyIPTV or anything in the multicast stack care aboutL2MTU.

1492 MTU on PPPoE is quite backwards as well.... normally a provider would implement RFC4638 and allow 1500 byte MTU.That can also solve performance issues sometimes, as a smaller MTU leads to unnecessary retransmissions due to Path MTU discovery.

They support it in many central, but seems that mine isn’t supported. I tried to put 1500 but the actual MTU don’t change from 1492.

you can check actual MTU with your Asus connected as well. use e.g. ping with packet size and don't fragment option.

Could be related to igmp-snooping not working well? Or that ax2 doesn’t support hw-offload?When a cut occurs, I can see that the vlan2 (TV) TX flood stops and the RX of the wifi too, like the subscription of the multicast groups ending for a moments.

More useful info!I’ve been in front of the TV while watching it, with Winbox opened in my Macbook. Added a logging rule to imp-proxy debug. And also with routing imp-proxy MFC windows open to see active multicast groups.When a cut occurs, I can clearly see that at least 3 or 4 of the active groups disappears, until the image is recovered. And the groups packet counts start from zero again.The issue is with Igmp proxy for sure!This what the debug logging says: (the cut occurs approx at 18:27:30)Note that in messages like these, the 10.169.XXX.XXX is my static TV service address:18:28:27 igmp-proxy,debug ignoring IGMP message: source address is local:18:28:27 igmp-proxy,debug   source=10.169.XXX.XXX18:28:27 igmp-proxy,debug   interface=vlan2-iptv192.168.88.253 is the TV Box.Code:Select all18:27:02 igmp-proxy,debug sending IGMP query to 224.0.0.1 on bridge

I have no experience with IP tv and stuff. But I am interested and on internet I find sources that say IGMP snooping isn't even necessary on networks with only a few devices. And what is IGMP proxy actually used for?

And what is IGMP proxy actually used for?IGMP Proxy is needed in case of my ISP. It adds the necessary multicast groups dynamically.

I’ve tried to lower the value without success. In fact, the standard value for query interval should be 125s.

The default for ROS IGMP-proxy is "query-interval (time: 1s..1h; Default: 2m5s)". = 125s. You had it - according to your posted config above - at 30s.

After more investigation time, and passing more info to support in the ticket, they confirmed that the issue has been reproduced on their end. Seems that an issue with igmp-proxy, but not sure on details because support doesn't said much more. Not sure if it's affecting only ax2/ax3 or more devices. Waiting to the fix!

Ok, now I have the time, these are the things I discovered. In addition to post above.1. Seems that ROS has a bug with imgmp-proxy query response time. I've been using Wireshark on my MacBook connected to the 5Ghz wifi (same as TV Box).For example, setting 10s of max response interval, set 10s correctly. (Look to the IGMP info on Wireshark packet)But look what happens when you set 30s of max responseOr 40s2. Seems that IGMP Snooping isn't working good on wifi interfaces.When I scan with Wireshark on my Macbook, I can see all the UDP Multicast from it. Using the Asus, I can't see that UDP multicast traffic. And you can clearly see that behavior in WinBox, Interfaces menu. If the vlan2-iptv is transmitting let's say 8Mbps, wifi1 has about 36Mbps. If I disconnect the Macbook from wifi, traffic decreases. Same for the iPhone. And the opposite, if I connect again, traffic increases.3. Seems that for some reason, the IGMP Membership reports messages from the TV Box when using the Mikrotik, arrives later, with delay. For example, the Asus is using the standard, a query every 125s and max response time of 10s. Using the Asus, I never had a problem (cuts or pixelations). So the membership reports come all in less than 10s.Using the Mikrotik, sometimes the membership reports comes after more than 20s. Maybe related to the buggy IGMP.Waiting to support for a fix.

Hmmm.0x64=100 decimal=10 sec <-OK, so it is counted as tens of secondsYou probably have inverted the two other examples:0x90=144 decimal=14,4 sec <- 40 sec should be 400 -> 0x01900x2C=44 decimal=4.4s <- 30 sec should be 300 -> 0x012cSeems like a typical case of wrap around due to using one single byte for the value.Hence max settable should be:0xFF=255 decimal = 25.5 sec

Several months later, the issue is not resolved. Tested latest stable 7.17.1 and same cuts. Back again to the Asus router until I can use my Mikrotik with my ISP IPTV service.
