## Initial Question
BTH VPN WIREGUARD is not in chrwhen do we expect it , Are we expecting it? ---

## Response 1
CHR, well if you are using CHR at home and not in a VPS, cannot help you.The idea of CHR is to acquire a public IP address or at least a public WANIP in a specific geographic location.The key being you no longer need BTH because regular wireguard will work just fine.Good point that it should be included in case one is use CHR behind a non-public IP....... probably they didnt think of it??I believe BTH is limited currently to arm and Tile devices, so there may be other limitations at play.. ---
