```
And this is what I've got so far --- can't make it work.  Something is missing.   I really want 192.168.20.10 to go to port 1, 192.168.20.20 to go to port 2, .... 192.168.20.70 to port 7 and use port 8 as the external port

Okay. Now I see. So while until now you had a Mikrotik router per system/device, now you want one router to handle multiple systems. This is entirely doable.This doesn't answer your question directly, but have you considered using a cheaper router (the hEX refresh for example) and retain the one system - one router design? This would allow you to retain the old config, and considering that you can (almost-kind of) buy 4 hEX devices for the price of one rb5009, would not increase price dramatically.Even for the multiple systems - one router way, I would still consider the hEX. This would allow 4 systems/router. (In these low volume industrial settings, this router is an ideal fit in many settings.)Alternatively, if you have more than 7 systems, you could (depending on traffic volume) you could use a CRS device with the appropriate number of ports... Or if you need higher routing power, than a switch with the appropriate number of ports + rb5009 and VLANs.What I really can't understand is that while asking for help, and considering that there are people here that actually want to help you, you do your best to carefully guard any insight into what is that you actually want to do.Describe the problem. Fully!!!As to your question directly: yes in case you have more than one system on a given router with the same IP range, you have to have some way of separating them. VRFs are the usual weapon of choice. (While in your case it is not strictly necessary, look into the use of connection marks.) To do this successfully, while not especially hard, requires a solid understanding of networking. I'm sorry to say, but while I have done several such configs before (they are quite common in certain industrial systems,) I am not aware of any good online guide/tutorial on the subject.But *if* you write down your problem *fully* and don't leave me guessing I'm can at least give you some pointers.Questions:* How many of these devices/systems do you have?* Would you prefer a central (i.e. one router to handle all of them) or distributed (one router per system, one router per 4 systems, one router per 7 systems...) approach. Central is the easiest to manage, but a failure can take everything offline at once.* What is the traffic direction - i.e. is it always a central "controller" that initiates connections to the "controlled" systems, or are connections initiated in both directions?* What is the traffic volume/bandwidth? ---

Okay, the picture is clear now. As I've said this is entirely doable with Mikrotik devices, and I've done this sort of config for several systems. It does require a good understanding of networking in Linux. It is non-trivial in the sense that it is not usually done, and therefore a bit more than "copy from a cookbook" approach is required.Roughly:1. You set up VRFs:* Let's assume ether1 will be used as the "controller" port. This we will put (leave) in VRF main. (No setting required for this.)* The first device/system to be translated is then connected to ether2. We put this in VRF vrf1. The second device (ether3) we put in vrf2. You can figure out the rest2. We add addresses to the main VRF (ether1.) These will be all the addresses that we wish to translate (192.168.20.10, 11, 12, etc.). Plus add an address for the router itself for configuration purposes.3. We add a gateway address (192.168.10.1) into *all* device VRFs.4. Add a route into *all* the device VRFs to 192.168.20.0/24 pointing to ether15. Add an address/route to 192.168.10.0/24 to the main table. This can be on lo, on a separate bridge, etc. This is needed for the routing adjustment part of the packet flow. (This is kind of counter-intuitive, and this is not meant as a full explanation of what is going on.)6. Mark the packets that are from the controller to the devices (prerouting - mark routing action) - it is not necessary, but adding packet marks as well could result in more aesthetically pleasing nat chain7. Use policy routing (routing rules) to direct packets appropriately.8. Mark packets from the devices to the controller (prerouting - mark packet) (use these for src-nat)9. Use dst/srcnat (or as I would prefer, netmap) to translate the addresses.That's all there is to itI would have suggested that you contract your local IT supplier, because while it seems a bit involved, actually for someone who knows what they are doing this config can be done in 2-3-4 hours. (And most of that is replicating your setup to be able to test it, the actual config should take at max. 2 hours for someone with experience.) But you have done that and it didn't work outIf you can't find someone locally, I'm willing to consult with you, and replicate your setup, etc. and send you a tested/labbed configuration.If you rather want to learn, I'm still of course happy to help. Start by labbing up your setup (if you have not already done so.) I would suggest two devices, because that is then trivial to expand to more. ---

So your have a Mikrotik router, it has one port going to some switch with 2+ devices with same IP and subnet? If each device with the same IP was connected to a different port on Mikrotik router, the duplicate IP/subnet is solved by adding an interface to route, in which case only a src-nat be needed. But if you really have same IP with multiple device on same segment+subnet, you may need to do some more sophisticated tricks with /ip/arp and/or bridge NAT/filter rules but this get complex/specific.Most of time industrial device with the same IP are on different LAN/Layer2/ethernet segments (either via ports on Mikrotik or via VLANs coming from switch). If the device are all on the same LAN segment, you mention these device support 4 different subnet choices, so if you just switch each to a different subnet, then can all be on same L2/ethernet segment/"router port" & router would then use an 4 IP addresses, one for each of the devices unique subnets. And if you want to "renumber" them to a different subnet (like your 192.168.20.x), you can use "netmap" rule to remap the device subnet to something unique in your overall routing. This approach still mean your are limited to number of fixed subnets the device has per port/VLAN.Also I'm not familar with specifics on RouterOS v4... but I'm still not sure why this would have worked there. The only thing is perhaps the route cache helped with maintaining the ARP table, but really IDK - but v7 does use a different routing engine while v6 be more similar to v4.Which begs the question have you considered trying your v4 config on v6 first? V6 is still supported, so if that worked that might be an option, or at least a worthwhile test to narrow the scope of problem.(oops, RB5009 only support V7) ---

```
... and you use the packet marks in the NAT rules.It can be done in a less convoluted way and with fewer rules, but you lose some edge-case functionality/behavior - you only have to write out the basic config once and then change IPs around, so I tend to go with the more complicated approach if it yields fewer surprises in the future.Please note that this config was not tested...BTW the packet flow diagram needed to understand this is here:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... n+RouterOS

Unless I am missing something, it should be possible even without VRF's, the "generic" case being "access multiple devices with same fixed IP address connected to different ports/interfaces".Here is a solved case for two devices (I don't see how it cannot be extended to more devices, one per used port/interface):viewtopic.php?t=213056Using VRF's may make the configuration more "linear" and easy to read in the future, though.The referenced solution, adapted to ROS 7, would need explicitly declared routing tables (in /ip route the "routing-mark" would become "routing-table") so at the end it won't look very different from a VRF based solution. ---

``` /ip routeadddistance=1dst-address=10.1.1.0/24gateway=ether2 routing-mark=via-ether2 ``` Got hit hard with snow - company shutdown for a few days.So, I haven't given up. I still need to talk to someone about outsourcing this, but snow emergencies....It appears that 'routing-mark' isn't supported anymore in 'ip route'.
```
So, for RouterOS 7, I can't do one of the options.  It seems more options available via RouterOS 6.So, the 'src-nat' and 'dst-nat' is part of the Routing Decision and should be okay, ie src-nat/dst-nat  rules shouldn't change.The Firewall mangle rules have a 'mark-routing'  that let's me choose a routing table from 'main', 'vrf1', 'vrf2'.It appears that all I need, then are correct routing tables in 'vrf1' and 'vrf2'......Been trying it without luck.
