Okay, let's craft some expert-level documentation for managing users and user groups on MikroTik RouterOS, specifically targeting a 7.11 device (while still noting compatibility with 6.48 and 7.x), within the context of an ISP scenario, focusing on a /24 subnet and VLAN interface.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario addresses the need for granular user management within an ISP network, allowing for the control of network access and potentially applying differentiated services based on user groups. We'll create a user group with specific access levels and add users to that group for managing a VLAN 32 on subnet 13.246.205.0/24.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide for configuring users and user groups on MikroTik RouterOS:

### 1. **Step 1: Initial State & Pre-Checks:**

*   **Explanation:** Before making any changes, it's crucial to verify the existing configuration. This ensures you can revert if something goes wrong.
*   **CLI Example (Before):**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    /user group print
    /interface vlan print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):** You should see a list of any existing users, user groups, and VLAN interfaces. Note that the initial state will vary depending on your RouterOS configuration. The `interface vlan` command should show your `vlan-32` interface.

    ```mikrotik
    # /user print
    Flags: * - disabled 
    #   NAME      GROUP                                     
    0   admin  full                                    

    # /user group print
    #   NAME    POLICY                                                                                     
    0   full    write,read,test,password,web,winbox,api,ftp,reboot,local,telnet,ssh,sensitive,romon 
    1   read    read,test,local,ssh                                           

    # /interface vlan print
    Flags: X - disabled, R - running
     #    NAME     MTU   MAC-ADDRESS       VLAN-ID INTERFACE         
     0  R vlan-32 1500  00:0C:42:0A:11:22        32 ether1          
    ```

*   **Winbox GUI:** Check Users under System->Users and User Groups under System->User Groups, and the Interfaces under Interfaces -> VLAN.

### 2. **Step 2: Create a New User Group:**

*   **Explanation:**  We will create a new user group named "vlan32-access" with a specific set of permissions. This approach allows for easy management of user access levels.
*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group add name=vlan32-access policy=read,local
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    # /user group print
    Flags: * - disabled 
    #   NAME          POLICY                                                                                     
    0   full        write,read,test,password,web,winbox,api,ftp,reboot,local,telnet,ssh,sensitive,romon 
    1   read        read,test,local,ssh                                           
    2   vlan32-access read,local
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to System->User Groups, then click the "+" button. Fill in the name and select the policy. Click "Apply" or "OK".
*   **Effect:** A new user group named `vlan32-access` has been created with read and local policies. Users in this group can read system information and use local login methods.

### 3. **Step 3: Create a New User:**

*   **Explanation:** Now, we'll create a user named "vlan32-user" and add them to the "vlan32-access" user group. You should always use strong passwords for user accounts
*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=vlan32-user group=vlan32-access password="SuperSecretPassword123!"
    ```
    **Note:** Never use a weak password in production systems.
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```mikrotik
    # /user print
    Flags: * - disabled 
    #   NAME         GROUP                                     
    0   admin        full                                    
    1   vlan32-user vlan32-access    
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to System->Users, then click the "+" button. Fill in the name, the password and select the user group. Click "Apply" or "OK".
*   **Effect:**  A new user has been created and assigned to the `vlan32-access` user group.

### 4. **Step 4: (Optional) Limit user login to specific IPs:**

*   **Explanation:** For enhanced security, you can limit where users can log in from.
*   **CLI Example:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user set vlan32-user address=10.0.0.0/8
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
   ```mikrotik
   # /user print
   Flags: * - disabled 
   #   NAME         GROUP           ADDRESS      
   0   admin        full                                    
   1   vlan32-user vlan32-access    10.0.0.0/8
   ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Go to System->Users, then double click the user `vlan32-user`. Fill in the address field with the allowed IPs. Click "Apply" or "OK".
*   **Effect:** The user `vlan32-user` can now only log in from the `10.0.0.0/8` IP range.

### 5. **Step 5: (Optional) Test user login:**

*   **Explanation:** Test if the newly created user can log in via SSH with the specified permissions.
*   **CLI Example:**
    ```bash
    ssh vlan32-user@<your_router_ip_address>
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `<your_router_ip_address>` with your actual router's IP address and make sure SSH service is enabled for the device (IP -> Services).
*   **Expected Output:** If successful, you should be able to log in and use commands permitted by the `vlan32-access` policy. For example you can only read information, if you try to add anything, a permissions error will be generated.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/user group add name=vlan32-access policy=read,local
/user add name=vlan32-user group=vlan32-access password="SuperSecretPassword123!"
/user set vlan32-user address=10.0.0.0/8
```

* **`/user group add`**:
    * `name`: Name of the user group (`vlan32-access`).
    * `policy`: Comma-separated list of policies (`read,local`). `read` allows viewing of most router configuration settings and `local` allows login methods.
* **`/user add`**:
    * `name`: Username (`vlan32-user`).
    * `group`: User group the user belongs to (`vlan32-access`).
    * `password`: User password ("SuperSecretPassword123!").
* **`/user set`**:
    *  `vlan32-user`: Specifies the user `vlan32-user` which settings will be changed.
    *  `address`:  Specifies that the user will only be able to log in from this IP range.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Pitfall:** Forgetting the password.
    *   **Solution:** Use `password reset` to get an admin password if you have console access or through the neighbor discovery system if you can connect on the same LAN. Otherwise, a complete device reset will be necessary.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect policies assigned to the user group.
    *   **Solution:** Carefully review the policy documentation ( `/system/policy`) and test each policy before applying.
*   **Pitfall:** User lockout due to wrong address settings.
    *   **Solution:** Use the `/user print` command to check the address settings, and use console/neighbour discovery access to modify the user, otherwise a complete device reset may be necessary.
*   **Pitfall:** High CPU usage by many concurrent user logins.
    *   **Solution:** Check CPU usage with `/system resource monitor` and limit the number of active users or concurrent SSH sessions.
*   **Pitfall:** User fails to log in
    *   **Solution:** Double check that the SSH service is enabled at `IP -> Services`, also verify the IP that user `vlan32-user` is logging in from is in the correct address range.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **User Login:** Attempt to log in via SSH using the newly created username and password.
    *   ```bash
        ssh vlan32-user@<your_router_ip_address>
        ```
2.  **Policy Verification:** Try to execute commands that are not part of the `read` or `local` policies. These should fail with a permission denied error. For example:
     ```mikrotik
       /ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=ether1
     ```
3.  **User Listing:** Ensure the users and groups are listed correctly:
    *   ```mikrotik
        /user print
        /user group print
        ```

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **RADIUS Authentication:**  For large-scale user management, consider using RADIUS server integration for centralized authentication and authorization.
*   **User Profiles:** Combine with `/ppp profile` or `/ip hotspot` to provide specific network settings based on user login, which may be linked to the groups the user belongs to.
*   **API Access:** Users can also authenticate with the MikroTik API, and their permissions are determined by their group.
*   **Hotspot Users:**  Users created through the `/ip hotspot user` functionality can have their access controlled by policies.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

**Note:** The MikroTik API is not directly user-centric in that it does not have direct user or usergroup creation or modification endpoints, all these requests must be done using the CLI.

*   **Get Current Users:**
    *   **Endpoint:** ` /rest/system/user `
    *   **Method:** GET
    *   **Example cURL:**
        ```bash
        curl -k -u admin:<admin_password> https://<router_ip_address>/rest/system/user
        ```
    *   **Expected Response:** A JSON array of user objects with details like username, group, etc.

        ```json
        [
        {
        ".id": "*1",
        "name": "admin",
        "group": "full",
        "comment": ""
        },
        {
        ".id": "*2",
        "name": "vlan32-user",
        "group": "vlan32-access",
        "address": "10.0.0.0/8",
         "comment": ""
        }
        ]
        ```
    *   **Parameter Explanations:**
        *   `-k`: disables cert validation, for testing purposes.
        *   `-u`: Basic auth username and password.
        *   `<router_ip_address>`: The Router IP address.

*  **Handling Errors:**

    * If an API call fails due to an authentication error, the response will typically return an HTTP status code of `401 Unauthorized`. This indicates that the provided username and/or password were incorrect, or the user doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform that action. To fix this, double-check the credentials and make sure the user has API permission in their user group definition.

    * If an API call fails due to bad input, the response will typically return an HTTP status code of `400 Bad Request`, with some descriptive information in the JSON output. This will require reviewing the parameters you are sending to the API and ensure it is correct.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Limit Access IPs:** Restrict login access to specific IP addresses where possible.
*   **Audit Logs:** Regularly review MikroTik logs (`/log print`) for any suspicious activity.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant the minimum necessary policies to users/groups.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable services like Telnet, FTP, that are not essential for your operation.
*   **API Token Security:** Use API tokens with a limited access scope instead of using a username and password directly for API access.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides a solid foundation for user management in an ISP context. Improvements include:

*   **Centralized User Management:** Implement RADIUS authentication to manage a large number of users.
*   **Detailed Policy Sets:** Create more specific user groups based on customer tiers, with very granular control.
*   **Dynamic IP Address Control:** Add more features for limiting access based on specific IPs.
*  **API Token implementation:** Migrate away from basic auth to using API tokens.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

**User Management** in MikroTik RouterOS centers around controlling access to the router itself. This is critical for ensuring the security and integrity of your network. Users have assigned policies, which determine what features and actions they have access to.

**User Groups** streamline the process of assigning permissions by grouping users with identical or similar access needs. This promotes consistent and manageable security policies.

**Policies** define permissions. These include reading, writing, testing, password management, web access, winbox access, api access, ftp, reboot, local login, telnet access, ssh access, and access to sensitive information. This system allows a very detailed access permission setup on MikroTik routers.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Local vs. RADIUS Authentication:** Local users are suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, while RADIUS is preferable for large-scale networks where centralized authentication and user management is required, but introduces a dependency on the RADIUS server.
*   **Granular vs. Basic User Groups:**  More granular user groups provide greater control over access, but increase administrative overhead and complexity. Basic user groups are easier to manage, but may not provide the same level of control.
*   **IP Address Limits:** Limiting login IP addresses is great for enhancing security but can be too restrictive for some use cases where users might require access from different locations.
*   **API Access:**  Using the API provides more flexibility but requires knowledge of HTTP methods, JSON data structure, and might have higher security risks if not implemented correctly.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration was primarily tested with RouterOS v7.11. These commands are also compatible with 6.48 and most of the 7.x line, but some changes may occur in future versions or newer implementations. You should always double-check the MikroTik documentation for the specific version you are using.
