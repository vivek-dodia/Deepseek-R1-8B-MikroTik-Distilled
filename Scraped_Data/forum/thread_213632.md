Hello all,I am struggling to understand why I am getting DST NAT rule hits on traffic that is blocked by the firewall.For example, with following config:Code:Select allI have active logging on the third rule (DST NAT rule) and I keep seeing hits and traffic from random IPs getting NATted.I tested it with random public IPs -> session does not get established (as it shouldn't, since there is a whitelist), but hit counter goes up.Is this normal MT behavior? I would expect traffic getting blocked by the FW to not trigger any NAT activity.Thank you.Kind RegardsGomo

/ip/firewall/filter/
add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=new connection-nat-state=!dstnat in-interface-list=WAN
```

Can you share your complete firewall filter rules?You don't have this default rule?Code:Select allBesides this...why would you want to open port 22?

I do have following (besides 3 mentioned ones)Code:Select allAnd, no, unfortunately I cannot share the whole config -> hence why I wrote example FW rules. I won't even go into "why would someone open ports" question.TLDR, this doesn't really answer my question.. are there supposed to be hits on DST NAT rules for traffic that is not permitted by the FW?

This --> You can even combine the approaches, where rules in raw drop packets whose source address matches an address list, and rules in other tables populate that address listSpeaks to creating lists of addresses to block.I prefer knowing the incoming source address but you did give me additional food for thought to lighten the load so to speak on the router./ip firewall address-listadd address=fixedWANIP1 list=Authorized  comment="server static user #1"add address=fixedWANIP2 list=Authorized  comment="server user #2"....add address=fixedWANIPXY list=Authorized  comment="server static user #XY"add address=dnydns-url1  list=Authorized  comment="server dynamic  user #1"....add address=dnydns-urlAB  list=Authorized  comment="server dynamic  user #AB"/ip firewall natadd chain=dstnat action=dstnat dst-address=localWANIP dstport=serverport  protocol=xxx  to-address=local-Server-IP  src-address-list=Authorized/ip firewall rawadd chain=prerouting  action=drop in-interface=etherX dst-port=serverport src-address=!Authorized
