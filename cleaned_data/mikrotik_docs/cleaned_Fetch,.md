# Summary
Fetch is one of the console tools in MikroTik RouterOS. It is used to copy files to/from a network device via HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or SFTP. It can also be used to send POST/GET requests and send any kind of data to a remote server. In HTTPS mode by default, no certificate checks are made, settingcheck-certificatetoyesenables trust chain validation from the local certificate store (can be used only in HTTPS mode).
# Properties
Property | Description
----------------------
address(string; Default: ) | IP address of the device to copy file from. Also at the end of the address you can specify "@vrf_name" in order to run fetch on particular VRF. You can skip specifying address and specify only VRF on this parameter, if you use URL parameter.
as-value(set | not-set; Default:not-set) | Store the output in a variable, should be used with the output property.
ascii(yes | no; Default:no) | Can be used with FTP and TFTP
certificate(string; Default: ) | Certificate that should be used for host verification. Can be used only in HTTPS mode.
check-certificate(yes | yes-without-crl | no; Default:no) | Enables trust chain validation from local certificate store.yes-without-crl, validates a certificate, not performing CRL check (certificate revocation list).Can be used only inÂ HTTPS mode.
dst-path(string; Default: ) | Destination path. Can be used to download file directly into an external disk, for example.
duration(time;Default: ) | Time how long fetch should run.
host(string; Default: ) | A domain name or virtual domain name (if used on a website, from which you want to copy information). For example,address=wiki.mikrotik.com host=forum.mikrotik.comIn this example the resolved ip address is the same (66.228.113.27), but hosts are different.
http-auth-scheme(basic|digest; Default:basic) | HTTP authentication scheme
http-method(delete|get|head|post|put|patch; Default:get) | HTTP method to use
http-data(string; Default: ) | The data, that is going to be sent, when using PUT or POST methods. Data limit is 64Kb.
http-header-field(string; Default:*empty*) | List of all header fields and their values, in the form ofhttp-header-field="h1:fff,h2:yyy"orhttp-header-field="h:fff\\,yyy"(within a single header multiple values need to be "escaped" using two backlashes).
http-content-encoding(deflate|gzip; Default: *empty*) | Encodes the payload usinggzipordeflatecompression and adds a corresponding Content-Encoding header. Usable for HTTP POST and PUT only.
idle-timeout(time;Default: 10s) | Idle timeout since last read/write action.
keep-result(yes | no; Default:yes) | If yes, creates an input file.
mode(ftp|http|https|sftp|tftp; Default:http) | Choose the protocol of connection - http, https , ftp, sftp or tftp. Mode option is deprecated. To specify a protocol that you wish to use, we advise using "url" parameter instead (for example, like this "url=sftp://your_IP_address").
output(none|file|user|user-with-headers; Default:file) | Sets where to store the downloaded data.none- do not store downloaded datafile- store downloaded data in a fileuser- store downloaded data in the data variable (variable limit is 64Kb)user-with-headers- store downloaded data and headers in the data variable (variable limit is 64Kb (20Kb for downloaded data, 44Kb for headers))
password(string; Default:anonymous) | Password, which is needed for authentication to the remote device.
port(integer; Default: ) | Connection port.
src-address(ip address; Default: ) | Source address that is used to establish connection. Can be used only HTTP/S and SFTP modes.
src-path(string; Default: ) | Title of the remote file you need to copy.
upload(yes | no; Default:no) | Only (S)FTP modes support upload. If enabled then fetch will be used to upload files to a remote server. Requiressrc-pathanddst-pathparameters to be set.
url(string; Default: ) | URL pointing to file. Can be used instead ofaddressandsrc-pathparameters.
user(string; Default:anonymous) | Username, which is needed for authentication to the remote device.
Certificate that should be used for host verification. Can be used only in HTTPS mode.
Enables trust chain validation from local certificate store.yes-without-crl, validates a certificate, not performing CRL check (certificate revocation list).Can be used only inÂ HTTPS mode.
Time how long fetch should run.
A domain name or virtual domain name (if used on a website, from which you want to copy information). For example,
```
address=wiki.mikrotik.com host=forum.mikrotik.com
```
http-method(delete|get|head|post|put|patch; Default:get)
```
http-header-field="h1:fff,h2:yyy"
```
```
http-header-field="h:fff\\,yyy"
```
```
none
```
```
file
```
```
user
```
# Configuration Examples
The following example shows how to copy the file with filename "conf.rsc" from a device with ip address 192.168.88.2 by FTP protocol and save it as file with filename "123.rsc". User and password are needed to login into the device.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool> fetch address=192.168.88.2 src-path=conf.rsc \
user=admin mode=ftp password=123 dst-path=123.rsc port=21 \
host="" keep-result=yes
```
Example to upload file to another router:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /tool> fetch address=192.168.88.2 src-path=conf.rsc \
user=admin mode=ftp password=123 dst-path=123.rsc upload=yes
```
Another file download example that demonstrates the usage of url property.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /> /tool fetch url="https://www.mikrotik.com/img/netaddresses2.pdf" mode=http
status: finished
[admin@test_host] /> /file print
# NAME                     TYPE                  SIZE                 CREATION-TIME

# Sending information to a remote host
It is possible to use an HTTP POST request to send information to a remote server, that is prepared to accept it. In the following example, we send geographic coordinates to a PHP page:
```
/tool/fetch http-method=post http-header-field="Content-Type:application/json" http-data="{\"lat\":\"56.12\",\"lon\":\"25.12\"}" url="https://testserver.lv/index.php"
```
In this example, the data is uploaded as a file. Important note, since variable data comes from a file, a file can only be in size up to 4KB. This is a limitation of RouterOS variables.
```
/export file=export.rsc
:global data [/file get [/file find name=export.rsc] contents];
:global $url "https://prod-51.westeurope.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/blabla/triggers/manual/paths/invoke....";
/tool fetch mode=https http-method=put http-data=$data url=$url
```
# Return value to a variable
It is possible to save the result of the fetch command to a variable. For example, it is possible to trigger a certain action based on the result that an HTTP page returns. You can find a very simple example below that disablesether2whenever a PHP page returns "0":
```
{
:local result [/tool fetch url=https://10.0.0.1/disable_ether2.php as-value output=user];
:if ($result->"status" = "finished") do={
:if ($result->"data" = "0") do={
/interface ethernet set ether2 disabled=yes;
} else={
/interface ethernet set ether2 disabled=no;
}
}
}
```
