## Initial Question
Hi, do you know how to configure voice pppoe on for example a mikrotik hap ax^2? ---

## Response 1
Can you elaborate on what a voice pppoe is? Does your ISP provide a dedicated PPPoE account for a Voice over IP service? If yes, do you have the credentials you need to register your phone number with their voice exchange once the data channel to it gets established? ---
