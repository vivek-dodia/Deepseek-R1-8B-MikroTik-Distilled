Okay, this is a massive undertaking, but I'll deliver a comprehensive documentation focusing on IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6) within a broader context of the MikroTik RouterOS ecosystem, as you've requested.

Due to the immense scope, I'll provide detailed examples and explanations for the core IP addressing concepts, then provide high-level overviews and relevant configurations for the other features you requested.

**Important Note:** This document is designed for an SMB environment, but the concepts are applicable to various scales. I'll be using RouterOS 7.12 as a base. While 6.x has differences, core IP addressing concepts remain largely compatible, but some features might be unavailable or vary in command structure.

## **1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:**

We are setting up a small office network using a MikroTik router (e.g., a hAP ac2, or a more powerful CCR). We require a robust and secure network with both IPv4 and IPv6 capabilities. The network will consist of the following:

*   **Internet Access:** Connection via a static IP (IPv4 and IPv6) provided by the ISP on ether1.
*   **Internal Network:** A private network using a 192.168.88.0/24 IPv4 range and a unique local IPv6 address.
*   **Wi-Fi:** A wireless network bridging into the same internal network segment.
*   **Guest Network:**  A separate VLAN for guest devices, with limited access to the internal network.
*   **VPN Access:** IPsec VPN for remote access from external networks.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   Configure static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the WAN interface (ether1).
*   Configure DHCPv4 server and IPv6 NDP server for the internal network (bridge).
*   Create an IP pool for DHCPv4 leases and IPv6.
*   Implement a basic firewall with NAT to enable internet access.
*   Create a separate VLAN with a firewall rule.
*   Enable basic IPv6 functionality with NDP.
*   Implement secure password policies and basic security for access to the router.

## **2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

Letâ€™s begin with the MikroTik configuration:

**2.1. Connecting to your MikroTik Router:**

*   **Winbox:** Download and run Winbox. It'll discover your MikroTik device (ensure the device is on the same network). Login using the default credentials (usually username `admin` and an empty password or the password you set).
*   **CLI (Terminal):** Alternatively, you can connect via SSH.

**2.2. Configuring Basic Settings**

   *   **Set router identity and time zone:**

      ```mikrotik
      /system identity set name=OfficeRouter
      /system clock set time-zone-name=America/New_York
      ```
**2.3. Configuring WAN Interface (ether1):**

*   **IPv4:**
   *Set your static IP, gateway, and subnet mask:*
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=203.0.113.10/24 interface=ether1
    /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=203.0.113.1
    ```
    *   **Explanation:**
      *   `203.0.113.10/24`: Replace with your actual static IP and subnet mask provided by your ISP.
      *   `ether1`:  The interface connected to your ISP.
      *    `203.0.113.1`: Replace with your actual Gateway.
*   **IPv6:**
    *   Set your static IP, gateway, and prefix length.
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::10/64 interface=ether1
    /ipv6 route add dst-address=::/0 gateway=2001:db8::1
    ```
    *   **Explanation:**
          *   `2001:db8::10/64`: Replace with your ISP provided IPv6 address.
          *   `ether1`:  The interface connected to your ISP.
          *    `2001:db8::1`: Replace with your actual IPv6 Gateway.
   *   **Note:** Use your ISP provided IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. The examples above are for demonstration.

**2.4. Creating a Bridge Interface (LAN):**

*   Create a bridge interface for the LAN network:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge add name=bridge-lan
    /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-lan interface=ether2
    /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-lan interface=wlan1
    ```

   *   **Explanation:**
     *   `bridge-lan`:  Name of your bridge for the LAN network.
     *   `ether2`: Assuming ether2 is a physical ethernet interface connecting the LAN.
     *   `wlan1`: Assuming wlan1 is your primary Wi-Fi interface.

**2.5. Configuring LAN IP Addresses:**

*   **IPv4:**
  *Set a static IP for the bridge interface.*
   ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=bridge-lan
   ```
*   **IPv6:**
  *Set a unique local IPv6 for the bridge interface.*
   ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address add address=fd00::1/64 interface=bridge-lan
   ```

**2.6. Configuring DHCP Server (IPv4):**

*   Create an IP pool for DHCP leases:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=dhcp_pool ranges=192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254
    ```

*   Configure the DHCP server on the LAN interface:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=bridge-lan lease-time=10m name=dhcp_server_lan
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.88.1
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `dhcp_pool`: The IP address pool defined earlier.
        *   `10m`: DHCP lease time (10 minutes).
        *   `192.168.88.0/24`: The local network address and subnet mask.
        *   `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Google's public DNS servers.
        *   `192.168.88.1`: The gateway address of your local network.

**2.7. Configuring IPv6 NDP Server:**
*   Enable IPv6 NDP Router Advertisements:

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 nd add interface=bridge-lan ra-interval=30s managed-address-flag=no other-config-flag=yes
    ```
   *   **Explanation:**
         *   `ra-interval`: The interval at which router advertisement are sent
         *   `managed-address-flag`: This flag signals if addresses should be assigned by DHCPv6 servers. (Set to no for stateless DHCPv6).
         *   `other-config-flag`: This flag signals if other network configuration (like DNS) should be provided via DHCPv6

**2.8. Implementing Basic Firewall (IPv4 NAT):**

*   Enable NAT for the internal network to access the internet:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `srcnat`: Source network address translation.
        *   `out-interface=ether1`: The internet-facing interface.
        *   `action=masquerade`: Dynamically use the IP of the out-interface for NAT.

*   Enable basic forward rule:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
    /ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward in-interface=bridge-lan out-interface=ether1
    /ip firewall filter add action=drop chain=forward
    ```

**2.9. Creating a VLAN (Guest Network):**

*   Add a new VLAN interface on the bridge:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan add name=vlan10 id=10 interface=bridge-lan
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `vlan10`: The VLAN interface name.
        *   `id=10`: The VLAN tag.
        *   `interface=bridge-lan`: The interface the VLAN belongs to.

*   Configure the guest network IP (IPv4):
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=vlan10
    ```

*   Configure the DHCP server on the guest network (IPv4):
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=guest_pool ranges=192.168.99.10-192.168.99.254
    /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=guest_pool interface=vlan10 lease-time=10m name=dhcp_server_guest
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.99.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.99.1
    ```

*    Enable IPv6 NDP Router Advertisements on the guest interface:
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 nd add interface=vlan10 ra-interval=30s managed-address-flag=no other-config-flag=yes
    ```
*   Set a local IPv6 address for the guest interface:
    ```mikrotik
     /ipv6 address add address=fd01::1/64 interface=vlan10
    ```

*   Add Firewall rules for the guest network:
     ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related
    /ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=forward in-interface=vlan10 out-interface=ether1
    /ip firewall filter add action=drop chain=forward in-interface=vlan10 out-interface=bridge-lan
    /ip firewall filter add action=drop chain=forward
    ```
    *   **Explanation:**
         *  The rule `in-interface=vlan10 out-interface=bridge-lan` will drop any traffic trying to get to the internal network from the guest network
**2.10. Implementing IPsec VPN:**

    *   Note: IPsec configurations can be very complex, this is a basic configuration example.
     ```mikrotik
     /ip ipsec peer add address=0.0.0.0/0 profile=default-encryption exchange-mode=main secret="your_pre_shared_key"
     /ip ipsec proposal add auth-algorithms=sha256 enc-algorithms=aes-256-cbc lifetime=1h name=default-encryption
     /ip ipsec policy add action=encrypt ipsec-protocols=esp level=require peer=0 protocol=all sa-src-address=203.0.113.10 sa-dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 tunnel=yes
     /ip ipsec identity add auth-method=pre-shared-key peer=0 policy=0 secret="your_pre_shared_key"
     ```

**2.11. Security Settings**
    *   Set a strong password for the admin user:
    ```mikrotik
    /user set admin password="StrongPassword123!"
    ```
    *   Disable unwanted services
    ```mikrotik
    /ip service disable telnet
    ```
    *   Allow only specific IP's to access the router
    ```mikrotik
    /ip service set api disabled=yes
    /ip service set api-ssl disabled=yes
    /ip service set ssh address=192.168.88.0/24
    /ip service set www address=192.168.88.0/24
    /ip service set winbox address=192.168.88.0/24
    ```

**8. In-Depth Explanation of Core Concepts (MikroTik Implementation)**

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik's bridging combines multiple interfaces into one logical segment. Traffic between the bridged interfaces is forwarded based on MAC addresses.
*   **Routing:** MikroTik routes packets based on destination IP addresses. It utilizes a routing table to determine the next hop. The router is able to handle both static and dynamic routes.
*   **Firewall:** The firewall filters packets based on configurable rules. It features stateful inspection, NAT, and L7 filtering for fine-grained control.
*   **IP Pools:** IP Pools are a list of IP addresses that can be assigned to DHCP clients or other uses within MikroTik.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex and unique passwords for all users.
*   **Secure Services:** Disable unnecessary services, restrict access to services only from allowed IPs
*   **Firewall:** Implement a strong firewall policy, and disable forwarding for all except required traffic.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Keep RouterOS updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Access:** Only use secure access methods like SSH, winbox, or API-SSL.
*   **Backup:** Regularly backup the router configuration (`/system backup save name=config`).
*   **Disable Default Account:** It is best practice to disable or delete the `admin` account.
*   **Change Default Ports:** Change the default service ports if possible.
