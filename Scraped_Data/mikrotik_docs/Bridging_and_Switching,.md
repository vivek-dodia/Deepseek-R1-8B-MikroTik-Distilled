# Summary
Ethernet-like networks (Ethernet, Ethernet over IP, IEEE 802.11 in ap-bridge or bridge mode, WDS, VLAN) can be connected together using MAC bridges. The bridge feature allows the interconnection of hosts connected to separate LANs (using EoIP, geographically distributed networks can be bridged as well if any kind of IP network interconnection exists between them) as if they were attached to a single LAN. As bridges are transparent, they do not appear in the traceroute list, and no utility can make a distinction between a host working in one LAN and a host working in another LAN if these LANs are bridged. However, depending on the way the LANs are interconnected, latency and data rate between hosts may vary.
Network loops may emerge (intentionally or not) in complex topologies. Without any special treatment, loops would prevent the network from functioning normally, as they would lead to avalanche-like packet multiplication. Each bridge runs an algorithm that calculates how the loop can be prevented. (R/M)STP allows bridges to communicate with each other, so they can negotiate a loop-free topology. All other alternative connections that would otherwise form loops are put on standby, so that should the main connection fail, another connection could take its place. This algorithm exchanges configuration messages (BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit) periodically, so that all bridges are updated with the newest information about changes in a network topology. (R/M)STP selects a root bridge which is responsible for network reconfiguration, such as blocking and opening ports on other bridges. The root bridge is the bridge with the lowest bridge ID.
# Bridge Interface Setup
To combine a number of networks into one bridge, a bridge interface should be created. Later, all the desired interfaces should be set up as its ports. By default, bridge MAC address will be chosen automatically, depending on the bridge port configuration. To avoid unwanted MAC address changes, it is recommended to disable "auto-mac" and manually specifying the MAC address by using "admin-mac".

Property | Description | Data rate | Long | Short
-------------------------------------------------
add-dhcp-option82(yes|no; Default:no) | Whether to add DHCP Option-82 information (Agent Remote ID and Agent Circuit ID) to DHCP packets. Can be used together with Option-82 capable DHCP server to assign IP addresses and implement policies. This property only has an effect whendhcp-snoopingis set toyes.
admin-mac(MAC address; Default:none) | Static MAC address of the bridge. This property only has an effect whenauto-macis set tono.
ageing-time(time; Default:00:05:00) | How long a host's information will be kept in the bridge database.
arp(disabled|enabled|local-proxy-arp | proxy-arp | reply-only; Default:enabled) | Address Resolution Protocol settingdisabled- the interface will not use ARPenabled- the interface will use ARPlocal-proxy-arp-the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to the same interfaceproxy-arp-the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfacesreply-only- the interface will only respond to requests originating from matching IP address/MAC address combinations that are entered as static entries in the IP/ARP table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the IP/ARP table. Therefore, for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.
arp-timeout(auto | integer; Default:auto) | How long the ARP record is kept in the ARP table after no packets are received from IP address. Valueautoequals to the value ofarp-timeoutinip/settings, default is30s.
auto-mac(yes | no; Default:yes) | Whenauto-mac=yesis configured, the bridge will automatically select a MAC address for the bridge interface based on the following order of priority:From an Ethernet interface that is part of the bridge;From a non-Ethernet interface in the bridge (e.g., WiFi or tunnel);A randomly generated address if neither of the above is available.If the configuration is changed, for example, you add a new port to the bridge, the bridgeâ€™s MAC address will be updated only if a higher-priority address source becomes available. For example, if the bridge initially used a randomly generated MAC, then an Ethernet interface was added, the MAC would update according to the highest available priority (in this case, the Ethernet interface).The bridge will also update the MAC address if the current MAC is associated with a port that is moved to a different bridge.The current MAC address and its priority level are saved and will be reused after a reboot.Whenauto-mac=nois configured, you can set a static MAC address manually using theadmin-macproperty.
comment(string; Default: ) | Short description of the interface.
dhcp-snooping(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables or disables DHCP Snooping on the bridge.
disabled(yes | no; Default:no) | Changes whether the bridge is disabled.
ether-type(0x9100 | 0x8100 | 0x88a8; Default:0x8100) | Changes the EtherType, which will be used to determine if a packet has a VLAN tag. Packets that have a matching EtherType are considered as tagged packets. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
fast-forward(yes | no; Default:yes) | Special and faster case ofFast Pathwhich works only on bridges with 2 interfaces (enabled by default only for new bridges). More details can be found in theFast Forwardsection.
forward-delay(time; Default:00:00:15) | The time which is spent during the initialization phase of the bridge interface (i.e., after router startup or enabling the interface) in the listening/learning state before the bridge will start functioning normally.
forward-reserved-addresses(yes | no:Default:no) | Whether to forward IEEE reserved multicast MAC address that are inthe01:80:C2:00:00:0xrange. Bridges compliant with R/M/STP standards should refrain from forwarding these packets, this property can only be applied whenprotocol-modeis set tonone.Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links, using bridge as media converters, or conducting network analysis).Here are some notable MAC addresses and protocols used by RouterOS:01:80:C2:00:00:00 -Spanning Tree Protocol (STP);01:80:C2:00:00:01 -EthernetFlow Control;01:80:C2:00:00:02 -Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP);01:80:C2:00:00:03 -Dot1xclient and server;01:80:C2:00:00:08 -Spanning Tree Protocol (for 802.1ad bridges, usingether-type=0x88a8);01:80:C2:00:00:0D -Multiple VLAN Registration protocol(for 802.1ad bridges, usingether-type=0x88a8);01:80:C2:00:00:0E -Link Layer Discovery ProtocolandMulti-chassis Link Aggregation Group;
frame-types(admit-all | admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged | admit-only-vlan-tagged; Default:admit-all) | Specifies allowed frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
igmp-snooping(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables multicast group and port learning to prevent multicast traffic from flooding all interfaces in a bridge.
igmp-version(2 | 3; Default:2) | Selects the IGMP version in which IGMP membership queries will be generated when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP querier. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
ingress-filtering(yes | no; Default:yes) | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge VLAN table. By default, VLANs that don't exist in the bridge VLAN table are dropped before they are sent out (egress), but this property allows you to drop the packets when they are received (ingress). Should be used withframe-typesto specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.
l2mtu(read-only; Default: ) | L2MTU indicates the maximum size of the frame without a MAC header that can be sent by this interface. The L2MTU value will be automatically set by the bridge and it will use the lowest L2MTU value of any associated bridge port. This value cannot be manually changed.
last-member-interval(time; Default:1s) | When the last client on the bridge port unsubscribes to a multicast group and the bridge is acting as an active querier, the bridge will send group-specific IGMP/MLD query, to make sure that no other client is still subscribed. The setting changes the response time for these queries. In case no membership reports are received in a certain time period (last-member-interval*last-member-query-count), the multicast group is removed from the multicast database (MDB).If the bridge port is configured withfast-leave, the multicast group is removed right away without sending any queries.This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
last-member-query-count(integer: 0..4294967295; Default:2) | How many times shouldlast-member-intervalpass until the IGMP/MLD snooping bridge stops forwarding a certain multicast stream. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
max-hops(integer: 6..40; Default:20) | Bridge count which BPDU can pass in an MSTP enabled network in the same region before BPDU is being ignored. This property only has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tomstp.
max-learned-entries(integer: 0..4294967295 | auto | unlimited; Default:auto) | Sets the maximum number of learned hosts for the bridge interface. The default value isauto, and it depends on the installed amount of RAM. It is possible to set a higher value than the default or chooseunlimitedoption, but it increases the risk of out-of-memory condition.The default values for certain RAM sizes:8192 for 64 MB;16384 for 128 MB;32768 for 256 MB;65536 for 512 MB;131072 for 1024 MB or higher.This limit specifically applies to the bridge interface, not the hardware limits on the switch FDB table. Even if the bridge limit is reached, the switch can continue learn hosts up to its hardware limits and make correct forwarding decisions. However, these additional hosts will not show up in the "/interface bridge host" table nor can be monitored. Additionally, hitting this limit could impact MLAG host synchronization.This setting has been available since RouterOS version 7.16.
max-message-age(time: 6s..40s; Default:00:00:20) | Changes the Max Age value in BPDU packets, which is transmitted by the root bridge. A root bridge sends a BPDUs with Max Age set tomax-message-agevalue and a Message Age of 0. Every sequential bridge will increment the Message Age before sending their BPDUs. Once a bridge receives a BPDU where Message Age is equal or greater than Max Age, the BPDU is ignored.This property only has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tostporrstp.
membership-interval(time; Default:4m20s) | The amount of time after an entry in the Multicast Database (MDB) is removed if no IGMP/MLD membership reports are received on a bridge port. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.
mld-version(1 | 2; Default:1) | Selects the MLD version in which MLD membership queries will be generated, when the bridge interface is acting as an MLD querier. This property only has an effect when the bridge has an active IPv6 address,igmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
mtu(integer; Default:auto) | Maximum transmission unit, by default, the bridge will set MTU automatically and it will use the lowest MTU value of any associated bridge port. The default bridge MTU value without any bridge ports added is 1500. The MTU value can be set manually, but it cannot exceed the bridge L2MTU or the lowest bridge port L2MTU. If a new bridge port is added with L2MTU which is smaller than theactual-mtuof the bridge (set by themtuproperty), then manually set value will be ignored and the bridge will act as ifmtu=autois set.When adding VLAN interfaces on the bridge, and when VLAN is using higher MTU than default 1500, it is recommended to set manually the MTU of the bridge.
multicast-querier(yes | no; Default:no) | Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge to generate IGMP/MLD general membership queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network. Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with IPv4 0.0.0.0 source address, MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring valuesigmp-querierandmld-querier).This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.
multicast-router(disabled | permanent | temporary-query; Default:temporary-query) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for a bridge interface itself. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to the bridge interface for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.disabled- disabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge interface regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.permanent- enabled multicast router state on the bridge interface. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge interface itself regardless of what is configured on the bridge interface.temporary-query- automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge interface using IGMP/MLD queries.
name(text; Default:bridgeN) | Name of the bridge interface.
port-cost-mode(long | short; Default:long) | Changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic values based on interface speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configuredpath-costorinternal-path-costproperties. Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate calculations for intermediate rates):Data rateLongShort10 Mbps2,000,000100100 Mbps200,000191 Gbps20,000410 Gbps2,000225 Gbps800140 Gbps500150 Gbps4001100 Gbps2001For bonded interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied, this value remains unaffected by the total link speed of the bonding.For virtual interfaces (such asVLAN, EoIP, VXLAN), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000 is assigned for long mode, and 10 for short mode.For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10 for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to bridge, for instance, by using the CAPsMANdatapath.bridge-costsetting.Useport monitorto observe the applied path-cost.This property has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tostp,rstp, ormstp. | 10 Mbps | 2,000,000 | 100 | 100 Mbps | 200,000 | 19 | 1 Gbps | 20,000 | 4 | 10 Gbps | 2,000 | 2 | 25 Gbps | 800 | 1 | 40 Gbps | 500 | 1 | 50 Gbps | 400 | 1 | 100 Gbps | 200 | 1

priority(integer: 0..65535 decimal format or 0x0000-0xffff hex format; Default:32768 / 0x8000) | Bridge priority, used by R/STP to determine root bridge, used by MSTP to determine CIST and IST regional root bridge. This property has no effect whenprotocol-modeis set tonone.
protocol-mode(none | rstp | stp | mstp; Default:rstp) | Select Spanning tree protocol (STP) or Rapid spanning tree protocol (RSTP) to ensure a loop-free topology for any bridged LAN. RSTP provides a faster spanning tree convergence after a topology change. Select MSTP to ensure loop-free topology across multiple VLANs.The forwarding of reserved MAC addresses that are inthe01:80:C2:00:00:0xrange is separatedfromprotocol-mode=none, and is now available as a controllable propertyforward-reserved-addressessinceRouterOS v7.16.
pvid(integer: 1..4094; Default:1) | Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. It applies e.g. to frames sent from bridge IP and destined to a bridge port. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
querier-interval(time; Default:4m15s) | Changes the timeout period for detected querier and multicast-router ports. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.
query-interval(time; Default:2m5s) | Changes the interval on how often IGMP/MLD general membership queries are sent out when the bridge interface is acting as an IGMP/MLD querier. The interval takes place when the last startup query is sent. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
query-response-interval(time; Default:10s) | The setting changes the response time for general IGMP/MLD queries when the bridge is active as an IGMP/MLD querier.This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingandmulticast-querieris set toyes.
region-name(text; Default: ) | MSTP region name. This property only has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tomstp.

Whenauto-mac=yesis configured, the bridge will automatically select a MAC address for the bridge interface based on the following order of priority:
```
auto-mac=yes
```
* From an Ethernet interface that is part of the bridge;
* From a non-Ethernet interface in the bridge (e.g., WiFi or tunnel);
* A randomly generated address if neither of the above is available.
If the configuration is changed, for example, you add a new port to the bridge, the bridgeâ€™s MAC address will be updated only if a higher-priority address source becomes available. For example, if the bridge initially used a randomly generated MAC, then an Ethernet interface was added, the MAC would update according to the highest available priority (in this case, the Ethernet interface).The bridge will also update the MAC address if the current MAC is associated with a port that is moved to a different bridge.
The current MAC address and its priority level are saved and will be reused after a reboot.

Enabling forwarding of reserved MAC addresses may affect certain protocols relying on these addresses. It is advisable to enable forwarding only when absolutely necessary, such as in transparent bridging setups (e.g., extending long links, using bridge as media converters, or conducting network analysis).

Maximum transmission unit, by default, the bridge will set MTU automatically and it will use the lowest MTU value of any associated bridge port. The default bridge MTU value without any bridge ports added is 1500. The MTU value can be set manually, but it cannot exceed the bridge L2MTU or the lowest bridge port L2MTU. If a new bridge port is added with L2MTU which is smaller than theactual-mtuof the bridge (set by themtuproperty), then manually set value will be ignored and the bridge will act as ifmtu=autois set.

When adding VLAN interfaces on the bridge, and when VLAN is using higher MTU than default 1500, it is recommended to set manually the MTU of the bridge.
Multicast querier generates periodic IGMP/MLD general membership queries to which all IGMP/MLD capable devices respond with an IGMP/MLD membership report, usually a PIM (multicast) router or IGMP proxy generates these queries.
By using this property you can make an IGMP/MLD snooping enabled bridge to generate IGMP/MLD general membership queries. This property should be used whenever there is no active querier (PIM router or IGMP proxy) in a Layer2 network. Without a multicast querier in a Layer2 network, the Multicast Database (MDB) is not being updated, the learned entries will timeout and IGMP/MLD snooping will not function properly.
Only untagged IGMP/MLD general membership queries are generated, IGMP queries are sent with IPv4 0.0.0.0 source address, MLD queries are sent with IPv6 link-local address of the bridge interface. The bridge will not send queries if an external IGMP/MLD querier is detected (see the monitoring valuesigmp-querierandmld-querier).

Changes the port path-cost and internal-path-cost mode for bridged ports, utilizing automatic values based on interface speed. This setting does not impact bridged ports with manually configuredpath-costorinternal-path-costproperties. Below are examples illustrating the path-costs corresponding to specific data rates (with proportionate calculations for intermediate rates):
```
path-cost
```
```
internal-path-cost
```
Data rate | Long | Short
------------------------
10 Mbps | 2,000,000 | 100
100 Mbps | 200,000 | 19
1 Gbps | 20,000 | 4
10 Gbps | 2,000 | 2
25 Gbps | 800 | 1
40 Gbps | 500 | 1
50 Gbps | 400 | 1
100 Gbps | 200 | 1
For bonded interfaces, the highest path-cost among all bonded member ports is applied, this value remains unaffected by the total link speed of the bonding.
For virtual interfaces (such asVLAN, EoIP, VXLAN), as well as wifi, wireless, and 60GHz interfaces, a path-cost of 20,000 is assigned for long mode, and 10 for short mode.
For dynamically bridged interfaces (e.g. wifi, wireless, PPP, VPLS), the path-cost defaults to 20,000 for long mode and 10 for short mode. However, this can be manually overridden by the service that dynamically adds interfaces to bridge, for instance, by using the CAPsMANdatapath.bridge-costsetting.

# Spanning Tree Protocol
RouterOS bridge interfaces are capable of running Spanning Tree Protocol to ensure a loop-free and redundant topology. For small networks with just 2 bridges STP does not bring many benefits, but for larger networks properly configured STP is very crucial, leaving STP-related values to default may result in a completely unreachable network in case of an even single bridge failure. To achieve a proper loop-free and redundant topology, it is necessary to properly set bridge priorities, port path costs, and port priorities.
STP has multiple variants, currently, RouterOS supports STP, RSTP, and MSTP. Depending on needs, either one of them can be used, some devices are able to run some of these protocols using hardware offloading, detailed information about which device support it can be found in theHardware Offloadingsection. STP is considered to be outdated and slow, it has been almost entirely replaced in all network topologies by RSTP, which is backward compatible with STP. For network topologies that depend on VLANs, it is recommended to use MSTP since it is a VLAN aware protocol and gives the ability to do load balancing per VLAN groups. There are a lot of considerations that should be made when designing an STP enabled network, more detailed case studies can be found in theSpanning Tree Protocolarticle. In RouterOS, theprotocol-modeproperty controls the used STP variant.
```
protocol-mode
```
## Per-port STP
There might be certain situations where you want to limit STP functionality on single or multiple ports. Below you can find some examples for different use cases.
### Create edge ports
Setting a bridge port as an edge port will restrict it from sending BPDUs and will ignore any received BPDUs:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 edge=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```
### Drop received BPDUs
The bridge filter or NAT rules cannot drop BPDUs when the bridge has STP/RSTP/MSTP enabled due to the special processing of BPDUs. However, dropping received BPDUs on a certain port can be done on some switch chips using ACL rules:
On CRS3xx:
```
/interface ethernet switch rule
add dst-mac-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF new-dst-ports="" ports=ether1 switch=switch1
```
On CRS1xx/CRS2xx withAccess Control List (ACL) support:
```
/interface ethernet switch acl
add action=drop mac-dst-address=01:80:C2:00:00:00 src-ports=ether1
```
In this example all received BPDUs onether1are dropped.
### Enable BPDU guard
In this example, ifether1receives a BPDU, it will block the port and will require you to manually re-enable it.
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 bpdu-guard=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
```
### Enable Root guard
In this example,ether1is configured withrestricted-role=yes.It prevented the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree.
```
restricted-role=yes.
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1 restricted-role=yes
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2

```
/interface bridge port
```
Property | Description
----------------------
auto-isolate(yes | no; Default:no) | When enabled, prevents a port moving from discarding into forwarding state if no BPDUs are received from the neighboring bridge. The port will change into a forwarding state only when a BPDU is received. This property only has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set torstpormstpandedgeis set tono.
bpdu-guard(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables or disables BPDU Guard feature on a port. This feature puts the port in a disabled role if it receives a BPDU and requires the port to be manually disabled and enabled if a BPDU was received. Should be used to prevent a bridge from BPDU related attacks. This property has no effect whenprotocol-modeis set tonone.
bridge(name; Default:none) | The bridge interface where the respective interface is grouped in.
broadcast-flood(yes | no; Default:yes) | When enabled, bridge floods broadcast traffic to all bridge egress ports. When disabled, drops broadcast traffic on egress ports. Can be used to filter all broadcast traffic on an egress port. Broadcast traffic is considered as traffic that usesFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FFas destination MAC address, such traffic is crucial for many protocols such as DHCP, ARP, NDP, BOOTP (Netinstall), and others. This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU.
edge(auto | no | no-discover | yes | yes-discover; Default:auto) | Set port as edge port or non-edge port, or enable edge discovery. Edge ports are connected to a LAN that has no other bridges attached. An edge port will skip the learning and the listening states in STP and will transition directly to the forwarding state, this reduces the STP initialization time. If the port is configured to discover edge port then as soon as the bridge detects a BPDU coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port. This property has no effect whenprotocol-modeis set tonone.no- non-edge port, will participate in learning and listening states in STP.no-discover- non-edge port with enabled discovery, will participate in learning and listening states in STP, a port can become an edge port if no BPDU is received.yes- edge port without discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.yes-discover- edge port with enabled discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.auto- same asno-discover, but will additionally detect if a bridge port is a Wireless interface with disabled bridge-mode, such interface will be automatically set as an edge port without discovery.
fast-leave(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables IGMP/MLD fast leave feature on the bridge port. The bridge will stop forwarding multicast traffic to a bridge port when an IGMP/MLD leave message is received. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.
frame-types(admit-all | admit-only-untagged-and-priority-tagged | admit-only-vlan-tagged; Default:admit-all) | Specifies allowed ingress frame types on a bridge port. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
ingress-filtering(yes | no; Default:yes) | Enables or disables VLAN ingress filtering, which checks if the ingress port is a member of the received VLAN ID in the bridge VLAN table. Should be used withframe-typesto specify if the ingress traffic should be tagged or untagged. This property only has effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes. The setting is enabled by default since RouterOS v7.
learn(auto | no | yes; Default:auto) | Changes MAC learning behavior on a bridge portyes- enables MAC learningno- disables MAC learningauto- detects if bridge port is a Wireless interface and uses a Wireless registration table instead of MAC learning, will use Wireless registration table if theWireless interfaceis set to one ofap-bridge,bridge,wds-slavemode and bridge mode for theWireless interfaceis disabled.
multicast-router(disabled | permanent | temporary-query; Default:temporary-query) | A multicast router port is a port where a multicast router or querier is connected. On this port, unregistered multicast streams and IGMP/MLD membership reports will be sent. This setting changes the state of the multicast router for bridge ports. This property can be used to send IGMP/MLD membership reports to certain bridge ports for further multicast routing or proxying. This property only has an effect whenigmp-snoopingis set toyes.disabled- disabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are not sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.permanent- enabled multicast router state on the bridge port. Unregistered multicast and IGMP/MLD membership reports are sent to the bridge port regardless of what is connected to it.temporary-query- automatically detect multicast router state on the bridge port using IGMP/MLD queries.
horizon(integer 0..429496729; Default:none) | Use split horizon bridging to prevent bridging loops. Set the same value for a group of ports, to prevent them from sending data to ports with the same horizon value. Split horizon is a software feature that disables hardware offloading. Read more aboutBridge split horizon.
hw(yes | no; Default:yes) | Allows to enable or disablehardware offloadingon interfaces capable of HW offloading. For software interfaces likeEoIPorVLANthis setting is ignored and has no effect. Certain bridge or port functions can automatically disable HW offloading, use theprintcommand to see whether the "H" flag is active.
internal-path-cost(integer: 1..200000000; Default:) | Path cost to the interface for MSTI0 inside a region. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the internal-path-cost based on the interface speed and theport-cost-modesetting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before theinternal-path-costproperty.Â This property only has effect whenprotocol-modeis set tomstp./interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !internal-path-costUseport monitorto observe the applied internal-path-cost.
interface(name; Default:none) | Name of the interface or interface list.
path-cost(integer: 1..200000000; Default:) | Path cost to the interface, used by STP and RSTP to determine the best path, and used by MSTP to determine the best path between regions. If not manually configured, the bridge automatically determines the path-cost based on the interface speed and theport-cost-modesetting. To revert to the automatic determination and remove any manually applied value, simply use an exclamation mark before thepath-costproperty.Â This property has no effect whenprotocol-modeis set tonone./interface bridge port set [find interface=sfp28-1] !path-costUseport monitorto observe the applied path-cost.
point-to-point(auto | yes | no; Default:auto) | Specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of failure. By setting this property toyes, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and waits for BPDUs from other devices from this single link. By setting this property tono, you are expecting that a link can receive BPDUs from multiple devices. By setting the property toyes, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In general, you should only set this property tonoif it is possible that another device can be connected between a link, this is mostly relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex,autoenables point-to-point functionality. This property has no effect whenprotocol-modeis set tonone.
priority(integer: 0..240; Default:128) | The priority of the interface, used by STP to determine the root port, used by MSTP to determine root port between regions.
pvid(integer 1..4094; Default:1) | Port VLAN ID (pvid) specifies which VLAN the untagged ingress traffic is assigned to. This property only has an effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
restricted-role(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables or disables the restricted role on a port. When enabled, it prevents the port from becoming the root port for the CIST or any MSTI, regardless of its best spanning tree priority vector. Such a port will be selected as an Alternate Port (discarding state) and remains so as long as it continues to receive superior BPDUs. It will automatically transition to the forwarding state when it no longer detects a superior root path. Network administrators may enable this setting to safeguard against external bridges influencing the active spanning tree, a feature also known as root-guard or root-protection. This property has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tostp,rstp, ormstp(support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).
restricted-tcn(yes | no; Default:no) | Enables or disables topology change notification (TCN) handling on a port. When enabled, it causes the port not to propagate received topology change notifications to other ports, and any changes caused by the port itself does not result in topology change notification to other ports. This parameter is disabled by default. It can be set by a network administrator to prevent external bridges causing MAC address flushing in local network. This property has an effect whenprotocol-modeis set tostp,rstp, ormstp(support for STP and RSTP is available since RouterOS v7.14).
tag-stacking(yes | no; Default:no) | Forces all packets to be treated as untagged packets. Packets on ingress port will be tagged with another VLAN tag regardless if a VLAN tag already exists, packets will be tagged with a VLAN ID that matches thepvidvalue and will use EtherType that is specified inether-type. This property only has effect whenvlan-filteringis set toyes.
trusted(yes | no; Default:no) | When enabled, it allows forwarding DHCP packets towards the DHCP server through this port. Mainly used to limit unauthorized servers to provide malicious information for users. This property only has an effect whendhcp-snoopingis set toyes.
unknown-multicast-flood(yes | no; Default:yes) | Changes the multicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic, this includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 andff02::1).Note that whenigmp-snoopingis enabled and IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.When using this setting together withigmp-snooping, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known multicast from the MDB table.
unknown-unicast-flood(yes | no; Default:yes) | Changes the unknown unicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding unknown unicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts unknown unicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port.If a MAC address is not learned inthe host table, then the traffic is considered as unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all ports. MAC address is learned as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received and the source MAC address is added to the bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learned.

Changes the multicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding multicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts multicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port. The setting affects all multicast traffic, this includes non-IP, IPv4, IPv6 and the link-local multicast ranges (e.g. 224.0.0.0/24 andff02::1).
Note that whenigmp-snoopingis enabled and IGMP/MLD querier is detected, the bridge will automatically restrict unknown IP multicast from being flooded, so the setting is not mandatory for IGMP/MLD snooping setups.
```
igmp-snooping
```
When using this setting together withigmp-snooping, the only multicast traffic that is allowed on the bridge port is the known multicast from the MDB table.
```
igmp-snooping
```
Changes the unknown unicast flood option on bridge port, only controls the egress traffic. When enabled, the bridge allows flooding unknown unicast packets to the specified bridge port, but when disabled, the bridge restricts unknown unicast traffic from being flooded to the specified bridge port.
If a MAC address is not learned inthe host table, then the traffic is considered as unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all ports. MAC address is learned as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received and the source MAC address is added to the bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learned.
## Example
To groupÂ ether1Â andÂ ether2Â in the already createdÂ bridge1 interface.
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offloadÂ 
Â # Â  Â  INTERFACE Â  Â  Â  BRIDGE Â  Â  Â  HW Â PVID PRIORITY Â PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST Â  Â HORIZON

```
## Interface lists
Starting with RouterOS v6.41 it possible to add interface lists as a bridge port and sort them. Interface lists are useful for creating simpler firewall rules. Below is an example how to add an interface list to a bridge:
```
/interface list
add name=LAN1
add name=LAN2
/interface list member
add interface=ether1 list=LAN1
add interface=ether2 list=LAN1
add interface=ether3 list=LAN2
add interface=ether4 list=LAN2
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN1
add bridge=bridge1 interface=LAN2
```
Ports from an interface list added to a bridge will show up as dynamic ports:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge port> pr
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offloadÂ 
Â # Â  Â  INTERFACE Â  Â  Â  BRIDGE Â  Â  Â  HW Â PVID PRIORITY Â PATH-COST INTERNAL-PATH-COST Â  Â HORIZON
Â 0 Â  Â  LAN1 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
Â 1 Â D Â ether1 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
Â 2 Â D Â ether2 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
Â 3 Â  Â  LAN2 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
Â 4 Â D Â ether3 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
Â 5 Â D Â ether4 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1 Â  Â  Â yes Â  Â 1 Â  Â  0x80 Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10 Â  Â  Â  none
```
It is also possible to sort the order of lists in which they appear. This can be done using themovecommand. Below is an example of how to sort interface lists:
```
move
```
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port move 3 0
[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port print
Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offloadÂ

```
Starting from RouterOS version 7.17, you can useinterface listsfor thetaggedanduntaggedproperties in thebridge VLAN table. This change allows for more flexible VLAN assignment to ports by simply modifying the interface list members, rather than updating each bridge VLAN entry individually.
```
tagged
```
```
untagged
```
If different interface lists are specified for thetaggedanduntaggedsettings, and there is overlap between the interface members, theuntaggedlist will take priority. You can check the current interface configuration withcurrent-taggedandcurrent-untaggedproperties using theprintcommand.
```
tagged
```
```
untagged
```
```

```
```
current-tagged
```
```

Port provides a backup path to the root bridge if the current root port fails.designated-port- port that is facing away from the root bridge and forwards traffic away from the root bridge to downstream devices.backup-port- port that is facing away from the root bridge, but is going to forward traffic. Port that serves as a backup for a designated port on the same segment.In RouterOS, therolemonitoring property displays RSTP roles, such asalternate-portandbackup-port, even when STP mode is enabled. While this is technically incorrect, it does not affect the operation of STP. This is because STP treats all blocked ports the same, without differentiating their purpose (e.g., as potential backup paths). The displayed roles are simply a reflection of RSTP functionality and have no practical impact when STP is in use. See more details onSTP and RSTP page.

# Hosts Table
MAC addresses that have been learned on a bridge interface can be viewed in thehostmenu. Below is a table of parameters and flags that can be viewed.
Sub-menu:/interface bridge host
```
/interface bridge host
```
Property | Description
----------------------
bridge(read-only: name) | The bridge the entry belongs to
disabled(read-only: flag) | Whether the static host entry is disabled
dynamic(read-only: flag) | Whether the host has been dynamically created
external(read-only: flag) | Whether the host has been learned using an external table, for example, from a switch chip or Wireless registration table. Adding a static host entry on a hardware-offloaded bridge port will also display an active external flag
invalid(read-only: flag) | Whether the host entry is invalid, can appear for statically configured hosts on already removed interface
local(read-only: flag) | Whether the host entry is created from the bridge itself (that way all local interfaces are shown)
mac-address(read-only: MAC address) | Host's MAC address
on-interface(read-only: name) | Which of the bridged interfaces the host is connected to
## Monitoring
To get the active hosts table:
```
[admin@MikroTik] /interface bridge host print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, L - local, E - externalÂ 
Â # Â  Â  Â  MAC-ADDRESS Â  Â  Â  Â VID ON-INTERFACE Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â BRIDGE
Â 0 Â  D Â  B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D7 Â  Â  Â ether1 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1
Â 1 Â  D Â  B8:69:F4:C9:EE:D8 Â  Â  Â ether2 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1

Â 3 Â  DL Â CC:2D:E0:E4:B3:39 Â  Â  Â ether2 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â bridge1
```
## Static entries
It is possible to add a static MAC address entry into the host table. This can be used to forward a certain type of traffic through a specific port. Another use case for static host entries is to protect the device resources by disabling dynamic learning and relying only on configured static host entries. Below is a table of possible parameters that can be set when adding a static MAC address entry into the host table.
Sub-menu:/interface bridge host
```
/interface bridge host
```
Property | Description
----------------------
bridge(name; Default:none) | The bridge interface to which the MAC address is going to be assigned.
disabled(yes | no; Default:no) | Disables/enables static MAC address entry.
interface(name; Default:none) | Name of the interface.
mac-address(MAC address; Default: ) | MAC address that will be added to the host table statically.
vid(integer: 1..4094; Default: ) | VLAN ID for the statically added MAC address entry.
For example, if it was required that all traffic destined to4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43is forwarded only throughether2, then the following commands can be used:
```
/interface bridge host
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 mac-address=4C:5E:0C:4D:12:43
```
# Multicast Table
WhenIGMP/MLD snoopingis enabled, the bridge will start to listen to IGMP/MLD communication, create multicast database (MDB) entries, and make forwarding decisions based on the received information. Packets with link-local multicast destination addresses 224.0.0.0/24 andff02::1 are not restricted and are always flooded on all ports and VLANs.To see learned multicast database entries, use theprintcommand.
```
print
```

Property | Description
----------------------
bridge(read-only:name) | Shows the bridge interface the entry belongs to.
group(read-only:ipv4 | ipv6 | MACÂ address) | Shows a multicast group address.
on-ports(read-only: name) | Shows the bridge ports which are subscribed to the certain multicast group.

## Static entries
Since RouterOS version 7.7, it is possible to create static MDB entries for IPv4 and IPv6 multicast groups.
Sub-menu:/interface bridge mdb
```
/interface bridge mdb
```
Property | Description
----------------------
bridge(name; Default: ) | The bridge interface to which the MDB entry is going to be assigned.
disabled(yes | no; Default:no) | Disables or enables static MDB entry.
group(ipv4 | ipv6 | MAC address; Default: ) | The IPv4, IPv6 or MAC multicast address. Static entries forlink-local multicast groups 224.0.0.0/24 andff02::1 cannot be created, as these packets are always flooded on all ports and VLANs.
ports(name; Default: ) | The list of bridge ports to which the multicast group will be forwarded.
vid(integer: 1..4094; Default: ) | The VLAN ID on which the MDB entry will be created, only applies whenvlan-filteringis enabled. When VLAN ID is not specified, the entry will work in shared-VLAN mode and dynamically apply on all defined VLAN IDs for particular ports.
Property
Description
```
vlan-filtering
```
For example, to create a static MDB entry for multicast group 229.10.10.10 on ports ether2 and ether3 on VLAN 10, use the command below:
```

In case a certain IPv6 multicast group does not need to be snooped and it is desired to be flooded on all ports and VLANs, it is possible to create a static MDB entry on all VLANs and ports, including the bridge interface itself. Use the command below to create a static MDB entry for multicast group ff02::2 on all VLANs and ports (modify theportssetting for your particular setup):
```

# Bridge Hardware Offloading
It is possible to switch multiple ports together if a device has a built-in switch chip. While a bridge is a software feature that will consume CPU's resources, the bridge hardware offloading feature will allow you to use the built-in switch chip to forward packets. This allows you to achieve higher throughput if configured correctly.
In previous versions (prior to RouterOS v6.41) you had to use themaster-portproperty to switch multiple ports together, but in RouterOS v6.41 this property is replaced with the bridge hardware offloading feature, which allows your to switch ports and use some of the bridge features, for example,Spanning Tree Protocol.
Below is a list of devices and feature that supports hardware offloading (+) or disables hardware offloading (-):

Footnotes:
* The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups. It is possible to correctly snoop DHCP packets only for a single VLAN, but this requires that these DHCP messages get tagged with the correct VLAN tag using an ACL rule, for example,/interface ethernet switch acl add dst-l3-port=67-68 ip-protocol=udp mac-protocol=ip new-customer-vid=10 src-ports=switch1-cpu. DHCP Option 82 will not contain any information regarding VLAN-ID.
* The feature will not work properly in VLAN switching setups.
* The HW vlan-filtering and R/M/STP was added in the RouterOS 7.1rc1 (for RTL8367) and 7.1rc5 (for MT7621) versions. The switch does not support other ether-type 0x88a8 or 0x9100 (only 0x8100 is supported) and no tag-stacking. Using these features will disable HW offload.
* The HW offloading will be disabled only for the specific bridge port, not the entire bridge.
* Only802.3adandbalance-xormodes can be HW offloaded. Other bonding modes do not support HW offloading.
* Currently, HW offloaded bridge support for the IPQ-PPE switch chip is still a work in progress. We recommend using, the default, non-HW offloaded bridge (enabled RSTP).
* The802.3admode is compatible only with R/M/STP enabled bridge.

Bridge Hardware Offloading should be considered as port switching, but with more possible features. By enabling hardware offloading you are allowing a built-in switch chip to process packets using its switching logic. The diagram below illustrates that switching occurs before any software related action.
A packet that is received by one of the ports always passes through the switch logic first. Switch logic decides which ports the packet should be going to (most commonly this decision is made based on the destination MAC address of a packet, but there might be other criteria that might be involved based on the packet and the configuration). In most cases the packet will not be visible to RouterOS (only statistics will show that a packet has passed through), this is because the packet was already processed by the switch chip and never reached the CPU.
Though it is possible in certain situations to allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, this is usually called a packet forwarding to the switch CPU port (or the bridge interface in bridge VLAN filtering scenario). This allows the CPU to process the packet and lets the CPU to forward the packet. Passing the packet to the CPU port will give you the opportunity to route packets to different networks, perform traffic control and other software related packet processing actions. To allow a packet to be processed by the CPU, you need to make certain configuration changes depending on your needs and on the device you are using (most commonly passing packets to the CPU are required for VLAN filtering setups). Check the manual page for your specific device:
* CRS1xx/2xx series switches
* CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers
* non-CRS series switches
## Example
Port switching with bridge configuration and enabled hardware offloading:

# Bridge VLAN Filtering
Bridge VLAN Filtering provides VLAN-aware Layer 2 forwarding and VLAN tag modifications within the bridge. This set of features makes bridge operation more similar to a traditional Ethernet switch and allows overcoming Spanning Tree compatibility issues compared to the configuration when VLAN interfaces are bridged. Bridge VLAN Filtering configuration is highly recommended to comply with STP (IEEE 802.1D), RSTP (IEEE 802.1W) standards and is mandatory to enable MSTP (IEEE 802.1s) support in RouterOS.
The main VLAN setting isvlan-filteringwhich globally controls VLAN-awareness and VLAN tag processing in the bridge. Ifvlan-filtering=nois configured, the bridge ignores VLAN tags, works in a shared-VLAN-learning (SVL) mode, and cannot modify VLAN tags of packets. Turning onvlan-filteringenables all bridge VLAN related functionality and independent-VLAN-learning (IVL) mode. Besides joining the ports for Layer2 forwarding, the bridge itself is also an interface therefore it has Port VLAN ID (pvid).

```
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 frame-types=admit-only-vlan-tagged
```
Since RouterOS v7, it is possible to route traffic using the L3 HW offloading on certain devices. See more details onL3 Hardware Offloading.
## Management access configuration
There are multiple ways to set up management access on a device that uses bridge VLAN filtering. Below are some of the most popular approaches to properly enable access to a router/switch. Start by creating a bridge without VLAN filtering enabled:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no
```
### Untagged access without VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the only requirement is to create an IP address on the bridge interface.
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
### Tagged access without VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering will not be used and access with tagged traffic is desired, create a routable VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address on the VLAN interface.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
### Tagged access with VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering is used and access with tagged traffic is desired, additional steps are required. In this example, VLAN 99 will be used to access the device. A VLAN interface on the bridge must be created and an IP address must be assigned to it.
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
For example, if you want to allow access to the device from portsether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1using tagged VLAN 99 traffic, then you must add this entry to the VLAN table. Note that thebridge1interface is also included in the tagged port list:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1,ether3,ether4,sfp-sfpplus1 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
### Untagged access with VLAN filtering
In case VLAN filtering is used and access with untagged traffic is desired, the VLAN interface must use the same VLAN ID as the untagged port VLAN ID (pvid). Just like in the previous example, start by creating a VLAN interface on the bridge and add an IP address for the VLAN.
```
pvid
```
```
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge1 name=MGMT vlan-id=99
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=MGMT
```
For example, untagged portsether2andether3should be able to communicate with the VLAN 99 interface using untagged traffic. In order to achieve this, these ports should be configured with thepvidthat matches the VLAN ID on management VLAN. Note that thebridge1interface is a tagged port member, you can configure additional tagged ports if necessary (see the previous example).
```
pvid
```
```
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan 
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=bridge1 untagged=ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
### Changing untagged VLAN for the bridge interface
In case VLAN filtering is used, it is possible to change the untagged VLAN ID for the bridge interface using thepvidsetting. Note that creating routable VLAN interfaces and allowing tagged traffic on the bridge is a more flexible and generally recommended option.
```
pvid
```
First, create an IP address on the bridge interface.
```
/ip address
add address=192.168.99.1/24 interface=bridge1
```
For example, untaggedbridge1traffic should be able to communicate with untaggedether2andether3ports and taggedsfp-sfpplus1port in VLAN 99. In order to achieve this,bridge1,ether2,ether3should be configured with the samepvidand sfp-sfpplus1 added as a tagged member.
```
pvid
```
```
/interface bridge
set [find name=bridge1] pvid=99
/interface bridge port
set [find interface=ether2] pvid=99
set [find interface=ether3] pvid=99
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=sfp-sfpplus1 untagged=bridge1,ether2,ether3 vlan-ids=99
```
After that you can enable VLAN filtering:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
## VLAN Tunneling (QinQ)
Since RouterOS v6.43 the RouterOS bridge is IEEE 802.1ad compliant and it is possible to filter VLAN IDs based on Service VLAN ID (0x88a8) rather than Customer VLAN ID (0x8100). The same principles can be applied as with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN filtering (the same setup examples can be used). Below is a topology for a commonProvider bridge:
In this example,R1,R2,R3,andR4might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic by 802.1Q (CVID), butSW1andSW2needs isolate traffic between routers in a way thatR1is able to communicate only withR3,andR2is only able to communicate withR4. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with an SVID and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by enabling the service tag 0x88a8, introduced by802.1ad, on the bridge. Use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
802.1ad
```
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x88a8
```
In this setup,ether1andether2are going to be access ports (untagged), use thepvidparameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
pvid
```
```
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```
Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```
When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
## Tag stacking
Since RouterOS v6.43 it is possible to forcefully add a new VLAN tag over any existing VLAN tags, this feature can be used to achieve a CVID stacking setup, where a CVID (0x8100) tag is added before an existing CVID tag. This type of setup is very similar totheProvider bridgesetup, to achieve the same setup but with multiple CVID tags (CVID stacking) we can use the same topology:
In this exampleR1,R2,R3,andR4might be sending any VLAN tagged traffic, it can be 802.1ad, 802.1Q or any other type of traffic, butSW1andSW2needs isolate traffic between routers in a way thatR1is able to communicate only withR3,andR2is only able to communicate withR4. To do so, you can tag all ingress traffic with a new CVID tag and only allow these VLANs on certain ports. Start by selecting the proper EtherType, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 vlan-filtering=no ether-type=0x8100
```
In this setup,ether1andether2will ignore any VLAN tags that are present and add a new VLAN tag, use thepvidparameter to tag all ingress traffic on each port and allowtag-stackingon these ports, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
pvid
```
```
tag-stacking
```
```
/interface bridge port
add interface=ether1 bridge=bridge1 pvid=200 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether2 bridge=bridge1 pvid=300 tag-stacking=yes
add interface=ether3 bridge=bridge1
```
Specify tagged and untagged ports in the bridge VLAN table, you only need to specify the VLAN ID of the outer tag, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge vlan
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether1 vlan-ids=200
add bridge=bridge1 tagged=ether3 untagged=ether2 vlan-ids=300
```
When the bridge VLAN table is configured, you can enable bridge VLAN filtering, which is required in order for thepvidparameter to have any effect, use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge set bridge1 vlan-filtering=yes
```
## MVRP
Multiple VLAN Registration protocol (MVRP) is a protocol based on Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) which allows to register attributes (VLAN IDs in case of MVRP) with other members of Bridged LAN.
An MRP application can make or withdraw declarations of attributes which result in registration or leaving of those attributes with other MRP participants.
Here's how it works.
MRP consists of two parts:
* Applicant- responsible for sending declarations (or leaves). Its behavior can be configured on a per-port basis using the setting calledmvrp-applicant-state, and per-VLAN using themvrp-forbiddensetting.
* Registrar- responsible for registering incoming declarations. Its configuration can be set per-port using themvrp-registrar-statesetting, and per-VLAN using themvrp-forbiddensetting.

```
mvrp-registrar-state
```
```
mvrp-forbidden
```
Registration Propagation:Incoming registration on a bridge port dynamically makes that specific port a tagged VLAN member. Additionally, the attributes associated with this registration are spread to all active (forwarding) bridge ports as a declaration.
Declaration Operation:In case of MVRP, the configured VLAN's get declared on each port, but they will only get configured as members of those VLAN's when a declaration is received from the LAN (Registrar will register the VLAN). From the perspective of an end-station, a single declaration will be registered on each upstream port across the entire LAN. When another end-station declares the same attribute, a path of registrations will be made between the two (or more) end stations, see the picture below.
MVRP helps to dynamically propagate VLAN information throughout the bridged network and configure VLANs only on the needed ports. This makes the network efficient by avoiding unnecessary traffic flooding.
As noted before, MVRP is only active on ports that are forwarding. In case of MSTP declarations and registrations are made only if the port is forwarding in the MSTI in which VLAN is mapped.
The point-to-point ports speed up theprocess of registration (or leaving). Manually configuringpoint-to-point=yescan be advantageous for non-Ethernet interfaces.
```
point-to-point=yes
```

# Fast Forward
Fast Forward allows forwarding packets faster under special conditions. When Fast Forward is enabled, then the bridge can process packets even faster since it can skip multiple bridge-related checks, including MAC learning. Below you can find a list of conditions thatMUSTbe met in order for Fast Forward to be active:
* Bridge hasfast-forwardset toyes
* Bridge has only 2 running ports
* Both bridge ports supportFast Path, Fast Path is active on ports and globally on the bridge
* Bridge Hardware Offloadingis disabled
* Bridge VLAN Filteringis disabled
* Bridge DHCP snoopingis disabled
* unknown-multicast-floodis set toyes
* unknown-unicast-floodis set toyes
* broadcast-floodis set toyes
* MAC address for the bridge matches with a MAC address from one of the bridge slave ports
* horizonfor both ports is set tonone
```

It is possible to check how many packets where processed by Fast Forward:
```

Â  bridge-fast-forward-packets: 16423
Â  Â  bridge-fast-forward-bytes: 24864422
```
Since RouterOS 6.44 it is possible to monitor Fast Forward status, for example:
```

# IGMP/MLD Snooping
The bridge supports IGMP/MLD snooping. It controls multicast streams and prevents multicast flooding on unnecessary ports. Its settings are placed in the bridge menu and it works independently in every bridge interface. Software-driven implementation works on all devices with RouterOS, but CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches, CCR2116, CR2216 routers, and88E6393X, 88E6191X, 88E6190 switch chipsalso support IGMP/MLD snooping with hardware offloading. See more details onIGMP/MLD snooping manual.
# DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82
DHCP Snooping and DHCP Option 82 is supported by bridge. The DHCP Snooping is a Layer2 security feature, that limits unauthorized DHCP servers from providing malicious information to users. In RouterOS, you can specify which bridge ports are trusted (where known DHCP server resides and DHCP messages should be forwarded) and which are untrusted (usually used for access ports, received DHCP server messages will be dropped). The DHCP Option 82 is additional information (Agent Circuit ID and Agent Remote ID) provided by DHCP Snooping enabled devices that allow identifying the device itself and DHCP clients.
In this example, SW1 and SW2 are DHCP Snooping, and Option 82 enabled devices. First, we need to create a bridge, assign interfaces and mark trusted ports. Use these commands onSW1:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
```
For SW2, the configuration will be similar, but we also need to mark ether1 as trusted, because this interface is going to receive DHCP messages with Option 82 already added. You need to mark all ports as trusted if they are going to receive DHCP messages with added Option 82, otherwise these messages will be dropped. Also, we add ether3 to the same bridge and leave this port untrusted, imagine there is an unauthorized (rogue) DHCP server. Use these commands onSW2:
```
/interface bridge
add name=bridge
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge interface=ether1 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether2 trusted=yes
add bridge=bridge interface=ether3
```
Then we need to enable DHCP Snooping and Option 82. In case your DHCP server does not support DHCP Option 82 or you do not implement any Option 82 related policies, this option can be disabled. Use these commands onSW1andSW2:
```
/interface bridge
set [find where name="bridge"] dhcp-snooping=yes add-dhcp-option82=yes
```
Now both devices will analyze what DHCP messages are received on bridge ports. TheSW1is responsible for adding and removing the DHCP Option 82. TheSW2will limit rogue DHCP server from receiving any discovery messages and drop malicious DHCP server messages from ether3.
# Controller Bridge and Port Extender
Controller Bridge (CB) and Port Extender (PE) is an IEEE 802.1BR standard implementation in RouterOS for CRS3xx, CRS5xx series switches and CCR2116, CCR2216 routers. It allows virtually extending the CB ports with a PE device and managing these extended interfaces from a single controlling device. Such configuration provides a simplified network topology, flexibility, increased port density, and ease of manageability. See more details onController Bridge and Port Extender manual.
# Bridge Firewall
The bridge firewall implements packet filtering and thereby provides security functions that are used to manage data flow to, from, and through the bridge.
Packet flow diagramshows how packets are processed through the router. It is possible to force bridge traffic to go through/ip firewall filterrules (see the bridge settings).
```
/ip firewall filter
```
There are two bridge firewall tables:
* filter- bridge firewall with three predefined chains:input- filters packets, where the destination is the bridge (including those packets that will be routed, as they are destined to the bridge MAC address anyway)output- filters packets, which come from the bridge (including those packets that has been routed normally)forward- filters packets, which are to be bridged (note: this chain is not applied to the packets that should be routed through the router, just to those that are traversing between the ports of the same bridge)
* nat- bridge network address translation provides ways for changing source/destination MAC addresses of the packets traversing a bridge. Has two built-in chains:srcnat- used for "hiding" a host or a network behind a different MAC address. This chain is applied to the packets leaving the router through a bridged interfacedstnat- used for redirecting some packets to other destinations
* input- filters packets, where the destination is the bridge (including those packets that will be routed, as they are destined to the bridge MAC address anyway)
* output- filters packets, which come from the bridge (including those packets that has been routed normally)
* forward- filters packets, which are to be bridged (note: this chain is not applied to the packets that should be routed through the router, just to those that are traversing between the ports of the same bridge)
* srcnat- used for "hiding" a host or a network behind a different MAC address. This chain is applied to the packets leaving the router through a bridged interface
* dstnat- used for redirecting some packets to other destinations
You can put packet marks in bridge firewall (filter and NAT), which are the same as the packet marks in IP firewall configured by'/ip firewall mangle'. In this way, packet marks put by bridge firewall can be used in 'IP firewall', and vice versa.
```
'/ip firewall mangle'
```
General bridge firewall properties are described in this section. Some parameters that differ between nat and filter rules are described in further sections.
