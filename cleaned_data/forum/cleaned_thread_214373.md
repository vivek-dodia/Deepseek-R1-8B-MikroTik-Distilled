## Initial Question
Our LtAP LTE6 works really well, the connection to the outside world through the SIM card is perfect, however the range of the wifi signal is only about 6-7 meters. I'm guessing that's not normal or is it? In any case is there some sort of a hardware setting for increasing the range? ---

Remove house walls/floors? ---

## Response 2
Remove house walls/floors?Oh it's a wooden house with practically no wallsSo my guess is that this isn't really an issue, the signal gets really weak on the same floor. ---

Makes me think of some antenna orientation issue or more likely interference on the chosen frequency from something ?? ---

## Response 4
What I'm not sure is what is the expected range? Without any obstacles how far should the signal be good enough? ---

## Response 5
LOS easily 30 metres ---

## Response 6
Okay, then something is really not okay ...Any ideas on how to debug this? ---

## Response 7
Wifi is not my forte but posting the config is a good starting place./export file=anynameyouwish ( minus device serial number, any public WANIP information, keys etc. )_ ---

The LtAP has a small 2GHz antenna inside, so it far from best for Wi-Fi performance in my limited experience with them.But @sindy is right, some data help. But my guess be "distance=" under Advanced, should be "indoor" - if not that can cause a lot flakiness. To check, go to "Wireless", then interface, then hit the "Advanced" button, then under in HT tab that appears , there is a "distance=" setting. In older default configuration, that used to be "dynamic" â€” but for normal Wi-Fi it should be "indoor". If that's wrong Wi-Fi will suck.Now you can wire-up pigtails to MMCX connectors on board (if I recall right), and use an external antennas be another option too. ---
