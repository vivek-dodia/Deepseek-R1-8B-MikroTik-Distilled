Hi!I have a CRS-112-8G-4S-IN and i trying communicate with a network using a SFP model: Planet MFB-F20. This SFP is Fast Ethernet.The switch recognize the SFP port. First, i uncheck the auto-negotiation option and select 100mbps speed, and the sfp port goes to running status.But i can't ping any device in network. In traffic secction i see only TX packets, RX keeps in 0b.There is any other configuration that i can do?Best Regards,

No, it doesn't appear that model supports fast ethernet SFPs. Seehttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ansceivers
