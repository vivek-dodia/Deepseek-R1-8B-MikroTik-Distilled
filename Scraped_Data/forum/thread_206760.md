```
:local test [/system routerboard get routerboard]; :put $test
```

The company I work for uses alot of scripts across both CHRs and routerboards. To validate if the script is currently running on a CHR or a routerboard we have always used the "/system routerboard get routerboard" command.It seems like that this has been removed in CHRs on ROS7. In ROS6 it would always generate false/true based on if it was a CHR or a routerboard.Does anyone know if  this will be brought back in ROS7 or if there is a better way to accomplish it?I have not been able to find any information why this was removed from ROS7 CHRs.If you want to test it on your own device you can run:Code:Select all

```
/system/resource get board-name
```

Code:Select allWorks good enough, thank you!Sad that the menu was removed, even though it was completely empty. It was nice to have a simple bool to check.
