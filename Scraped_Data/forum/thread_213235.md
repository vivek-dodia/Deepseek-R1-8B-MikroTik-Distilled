This is VERY odd indeed ?!And did you try simply using the mips package as it indicates ?Because what strikes me as equally odd, is that same QCA9533 CPU is used in mAP Lite and cAP Lite and those ARE mips devices. Not SMIPS.

Not SMIPS.Sorry, do you mean MIPSBE? But in specification an architectury of  hap lite is SMIPS. Also i have two same devices. And on another one i uploaded SMIPS and all works fine.
