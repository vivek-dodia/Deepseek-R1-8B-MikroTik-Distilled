Okay, let's dive deep into managing users and user groups on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 device, focusing on an SMB scenario with the given subnet and interface.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario focuses on a Small-to-Medium Business (SMB) network utilizing a MikroTik router to manage access to network resources. We aim to create specific user groups with varying access privileges. While this initial example will focus on local user management, the principles extend to RADIUS for centralized authentication. For this specific configuration, we are focusing on internal management of the router itself, and not on external user access. This includes webfig, SSH, and other router management protocols. The example will demonstrate how to set up user roles and assign users to those roles on a MikroTik Router. The bridge `bridge-54`, which is part of subnet `212.138.165.0/24`, is not directly related to user configuration, but we will keep the same context for the scope of this project.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide for configuring users and user groups on MikroTik RouterOS 7.11:

1.  **Step 1: Check Existing Users & Groups**

    *   **Purpose:** Before adding anything new, we'll check the existing users and groups to ensure we start with a clean state or understand the current configuration.
    *   **CLI Command (Before):**
        ```mikrotik
        /user print
        /user group print
        ```
    *   **Expected Output (Before):** Typically, you'll see the default `admin` user (enabled), and possibly other default groups.
        ```
        /user print
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
        #   NAME    GROUP     DISABLED
        0   admin   full     
        /user group print
        # NAME     POLICY
        0 read     read
        1 write    write
        2 full     full
        3 test     test
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**  Navigate to *System* -> *Users* to see the users and *System* -> *Users* -> *Groups* for user groups.

2.  **Step 2: Create a New User Group (Read-Only)**

    *   **Purpose:** We'll create a new user group with limited read-only permissions.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /user group add name=readonly policy=read
        ```
    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `/user group add`: Creates a new user group.
        *   `name=readonly`: Assigns the name "readonly" to the new group.
        *   `policy=read`: Assigns the "read" policy (from the default policy list) to the group.
    *   **CLI Command (After):**
        ```mikrotik
        /user group print
        ```
    *   **Expected Output (After):** You should see the new `readonly` group listed.
        ```
        # NAME     POLICY
        0 read     read
        1 write    write
        2 full     full
        3 test     test
        4 readonly read
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:** *System* -> *Users* -> *Groups*. Click the "+" button, enter the name "readonly", and select "read" in the Policy dropdown menu.

3. **Step 3: Create a New User (readonlyuser)**

    *   **Purpose**: Create a new user, and assign this user to the new group, with a specific password.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /user add name=readonlyuser group=readonly password="securePassword123!"
        ```
    *  **Explanation:**
        * `/user add`: Creates a new user.
        * `name=readonlyuser`: The username is `readonlyuser`.
        * `group=readonly`: The user will be a member of the `readonly` group.
        * `password="securePassword123!"`: The password for the user is set to `securePassword123!`. *Note:* This is an example password and should be updated to a complex and random password for production use.
   *  **CLI Command (After):**
        ```mikrotik
        /user print
        ```
   *  **Expected Output (After):** You should see the new `readonlyuser` user listed.
        ```
         Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
        #   NAME         GROUP     DISABLED
        0   admin         full     
        1   readonlyuser  readonly
        ```
   *   **Winbox GUI:** *System* -> *Users*. Click the "+" button, enter the name "readonlyuser", select "readonly" in the Group dropdown menu and enter the password. Click "Apply".

4.  **Step 4: Test Read-Only Access**
    *   **Purpose:**  Log in to the router using the new read-only user to verify its limited permissions.
    *   **CLI:** Open a new terminal session (via SSH) and try logging in with the username `readonlyuser` and password specified. In the terminal, try to run commands like `/ip address add`, which should fail because this user does not have `write` permissions.
    *   **Expected Result:** `readonlyuser` should only be able to run commands that read configuration, such as `/ip address print` but should not be able to write any changes to the configuration.
    *   **Winbox:** Try to log in with the `readonlyuser` and see what parts of the Winbox GUI are disabled or grayed out.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/user group add name=readonly policy=read
/user add name=readonlyuser group=readonly password="securePassword123!"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Pitfall 1: Password Complexity:** Using simple passwords makes accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Solution:** Enforce strong passwords (complex, long) using password policies when creating users through the user creation tool. The policy should include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
*   **Pitfall 2: Overly Permissive Groups:** Assigning users to groups with overly broad permissions (e.g., `full`) introduces unnecessary security risk.
    *   **Solution:** Create specific user groups with only the necessary permissions. Start with a minimal permission set and add more as needed. Avoid using `full` group unless there is no alternative.
*   **Pitfall 3: Accidentally Locking Out Admin:** Mistakes in changing the `admin` user's group or password can lock you out of the device.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the default `admin` account is configured with strong credentials and is kept separate from other, less privileged accounts. Consider disabling it, if it is not needed, once a new, full-access user is configured. Have backup access methods (e.g., serial console) ready. Do not disable the admin account before creating a separate, full-access user.
*   **Pitfall 4: Not Using a RADIUS Server for Large Environments**: The user database stored on the MikroTik router is not ideal for many users or when you need user information to be synced across devices.
    *   **Solution:** For larger deployments, use a RADIUS server for centralized user management. This also provides better accounting and security.
*   **Pitfall 5: Forgetting Passwords**: Users may forget their passwords if you do not store them in a safe location.
    *   **Solution:** Make sure users understand the requirements for password complexity, and consider using a password management solution.
* **Pitfall 6: Incorrect Permissions:** Users may have permissions that are too permissive or too restrictive to perform their required tasks.
    * **Solution:** Review the permissions of each user, and adjust accordingly. Create a user group for each type of user, instead of assigning users to an arbitrary group, to have better granularity and avoid common issues.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **User Login via SSH:**  Attempt to log in via SSH with each user (admin, readonlyuser) and observe the access rights of each user.
2.  **User Login via Winbox:**  Attempt to log in via Winbox with each user and observe which sections are enabled or greyed out.
3.  **Attempt Restricted Commands (readonlyuser):** Try to execute commands that require write access while logged in as `readonlyuser` (e.g., `/ip address add`). It should fail.
4.  **View Logs:** Verify system logs for login attempts and failures via the GUI or using `/log print`.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **RADIUS Authentication:** For larger environments, integrate with a RADIUS server for centralized authentication and authorization. This allows for easier management and enables advanced features like accounting and authorization based on policies.
*   **User Profile Management:** RouterOS does not have a native user profile management feature, but features like the Hotspot function can be used in combination with user profiles and quotas.
*   **Password Policy:** You can set a password policy to enforce password complexity requirements, or by using an external RADIUS server.
* **API Integration**: You can manage users and groups through the MikroTik API using HTTP requests or through CLI script.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

Here's a demonstration of how to add a user group and a user via the MikroTik REST API. **Note:** The REST API requires an access token from the MikroTik RouterOS device. Please refer to the MikroTik documentation on how to obtain an access token.

**Important Note**: REST API is available only for version 7 and later.

### 1. Add a User Group:

*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<your_router_ip>/rest/user/group`
*   **Request Method:** `POST`
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "manager",
      "policy": "write"
    }
    ```
*   **cURL Example:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"manager", "policy":"write"}' https://<your_router_ip>/rest/user/group
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success - 201 Created):**
    ```json
    {
       "message": "added"
    }
    ```
*   **Error Handling:** If a group with the same name already exists, you will receive a 400 error. Handle such errors in your application by checking the response code.

### 2. Add a User to the New Group

*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<your_router_ip>/rest/user`
*   **Request Method:** `POST`
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
       "name": "manageruser",
       "group": "manager",
       "password": "anotherSecurePassword123!"
    }
    ```
*   **cURL Example:**
    ```bash
    curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"manageruser", "group":"manager", "password":"anotherSecurePassword123!"}' https://<your_router_ip>/rest/user
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success - 201 Created):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "added"
    }
    ```

*   **Error Handling:** If a user with the same name already exists, you will receive a 400 error. Handle such errors in your application by checking the response code.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce complex passwords. Use a password management solution to generate and store them safely.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimal access needed to perform their jobs. Don't use the "full" policy unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable services like Telnet or FTP which can be accessed using clear text password transmission.
*   **Access Control Lists:** Use Firewall Rules to restrict management access to specific IP address ranges.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the user accounts, groups and their permissions for inconsistencies.
*   **HTTPS/SSH Access:** Ensure that access is over a secure protocol like HTTPS for webfig and SSH.
*   **Password Change Intervals:** Force periodic password changes to mitigate risk. This can be done via external RADIUS server policies.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration is a good starting point for user management, but it can be improved in several areas.

*   **Password Policy**: The current example does not enforce any particular type of password policy. This should be improved by using an external RADIUS server to set and enforce strict password policies.
*   **Centralized User Management:** The configuration is local to the router. Utilizing a RADIUS server would make it easier to manage larger user bases, and would allow for consistent policy management across a network of MikroTik routers.
*   **Automation**: Adding users and groups can be further automated using the REST API instead of manual commands.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

MikroTik RouterOS offers a robust way to manage users and their associated permissions. Users can be local to the router itself, or can be stored externally via RADIUS.

*   **Users:** Each user has a username, password, and is associated with one user group. Users are the entities that have some degree of access to the router, from read-only access, to full administrative access.
*   **User Groups:** User groups are collections of users that share the same access permissions (policies). Policies are predefined lists of what each user can or cannot do on the device. This includes system management, IP routing, firewall access, and others. User groups allow you to avoid configuring permissions for each user individually.
*   **Policies:** Each group is assigned a specific policy (read, write, full, test). Policies determine what permissions are granted to the members of that group. These policies are used to define the type of access that will be granted to a given user group.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Local vs. RADIUS User Management:** Using local user management is simple to set up for small installations, however, it does not scale easily and can become difficult to maintain if you have many users. RADIUS authentication offers centralized management, better user control and accounting, but adds complexity to the setup.
*   **Granular vs. Predefined Policies**: RouterOS comes with a set of predefined policies (read, write, full, test). These are useful for basic setup and common scenarios. For more advanced use cases, you can set up very granular user permissions via RADIUS.
*   **Single Admin vs. Multiple Admins:** Having multiple full-access admins makes it easier to collaborate and share the administrative workload of the router. This also creates a risk since if one admin account gets compromised, the whole device will be compromised. The main trade-off is between user availability and system security.
* **Password Complexity**:  Longer and more complex passwords make it harder for brute-force attacks to succeed. However, long and complex passwords can be hard to remember, which may cause user lockouts.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This documentation targets RouterOS 7.11, which should be mostly compatible with versions 7.x and 6.48. While commands for the creation of users and groups, for the most part, remain the same across different RouterOS versions, REST API functionality for the user/group is only available for RouterOS 7 or greater. Make sure to use the appropriate documentation for your specific RouterOS version.

This thorough documentation should provide you with the knowledge needed to manage users and groups on your MikroTik router effectively. Remember to adjust the configuration to match the specifics of your network environment and security needs.
