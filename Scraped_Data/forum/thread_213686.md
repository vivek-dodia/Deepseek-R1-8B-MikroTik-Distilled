Hello everyoneI would like to reduce the signal strength of my Mikrotik Router via Winbox to reduce unnecessary radiation.I have read various forum threads (e.g.viewtopic.php?t=59608) and the documentation (https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... properties), but it appears as that both are mostly related to older Winbox settings which I cannot find anywhere. From what I understood it used to be the correct apporach to set frequency-mode to regulatory_domain, distance to indoor and then increase the antenna-gain. Given that regulatory_domain is enabled, RouterOS will then ensure that the max. country levels are respected and the signal strength therefore decreases (apologies in advance if this would be nonsense, the above exceeds my technical understanding).Questions:1. I cannot find either frequency-mode nor distance in the Winbox settings and this leaves me thinking: If I increase the antenna-gain without having set neither the frequency-mode nor the distance, will this not rather increase than decrease the signal strength, as there will be no regulatory safeguard?2. If not, how should I proceed in RouterOS 7.16.2 resp. what are the best config settings to safely reduce the signal strength to reduce unnecessary radiation based on the config settings below?My wifi config is quite basic. The config and the outputs are as follows:Code:Select all
