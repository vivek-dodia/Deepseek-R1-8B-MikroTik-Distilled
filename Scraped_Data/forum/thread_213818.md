Hello folks, we are observing a condition that shows as all interfaces simply flapping physical link state. The only physical interface not affected is ether1 which we know is direct to the CPU.

All comes back clean and steady normal state on the graphs.The only thing that resolves this issue is rebooting the router. RouterOS version is 7.16 and we just upgraded to 7.16.2 tonight to try to resolve this. The issue usually manifests every 1-2 days but this last occurrence lasted over 10 days with no problem until now. These ports go to various different devices so it is not something in common with a singular far side device. I suspect a bug or problem on the switch chip itself but ability to drop down and debug at that level is pretty limited.Does anyone have any thoughts on this or seen anything like this?

Also will note that there are populated with DAC cables and RJ45 SFPs.
