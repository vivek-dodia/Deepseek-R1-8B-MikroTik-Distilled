Hi All,Im having some trouble with slower speeds and trying to figure out why:I have 2 routers both are 1016s, they are interconnected via a 60ghz link, R2 is the WAN Router and handles NAT, R1 is the LAN router.Running bandwidth tests from router to router shows ~970Mb (right where it should be)Running bandwidth tests from R2 to a various public test servers, same deal ~970Mb.Running bandwidth tests from R1 to public test servers ~600Mb.The firewall rules are extremely simple on R2:Input Drop from !MGMT list to 8291Input Drop from !MGMT list to 22Forward: FastrackNAT: Masquerade out ether1(WAN)I am sure its something simple that I'm overlooking, but I'm beating my head against the wall sorting out what. Any suggestions?

If the router R2 is like a Wan (main), then it should definitely use at least default firewall rules, because they affect traffic flow, security, stability, etc. The order of firewall rules is also important and they are executed from top to bottom. You simply don't have these rules! Accordingly, there is no security either.INPUT CHAIN ​​--> To the Router or to Router Services. Directional flow is WAN to Router, and LAN to Router.FORWARD CHAIN ​​--> Through the Router. Directional flow is LAN to LAN, LAN to WAN, WAN to LAN.OUTPUT CHAIN ​​--> From the Router. Directional flow is Router to WAN.If you want, you can read this description:https://tangentsoft.com/mikrotik/wiki?n ... figurationI had a somewhat similar case with a P2P wifi connection between buildings. For a long time everything was okay, speed and stability were okay, but one day it started to cause problems. The speed was sometimes lower than it should be and the link sometimes even ''stuttered''. I searched for the problem for a long time, but in the end it turned out that a microwave oven was regularly used in the next room, which greatly affected the wifi stability. Maybe in this case it was not right that the antenna was not mounted on the roof but was attached to the wall next to the window.If in your case there are no interfering objects next to the antennas, then the fault will be all in the configuration.
