I'm currently on the latest 7.17beta2 trying out the whitelisting for adlists.The way I've set them up is through static as FWD and under "forward to" I define a DNS server such as 1.1.1.1, this simply works.However, I can't seem to point toward the local server I'm running in my router, is there a wildcard for this or maybe I'm not seeing the problem?For reference:Which shows up as:Instead of hard-coding a "Forward To" address, can I point it to my local dns server instead?, does it require any additional setup for this to work?, or as its currently setup would this turn into an endless loop situation?

This doesnt seem to work. googleadservices.com is used in just about every shopping link so I need to whitelist it and I'd prefer to not be updating the adlist file frequently.Did you get anywhere with this?
