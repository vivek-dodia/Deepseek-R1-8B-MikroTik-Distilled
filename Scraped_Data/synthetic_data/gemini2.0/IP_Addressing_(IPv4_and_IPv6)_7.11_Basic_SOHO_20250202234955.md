Okay, this is a comprehensive undertaking! Let's tackle this step-by-step, focusing on a SOHO scenario using RouterOS 7.11 and addressing all the requested topics related to IP Addressing, but with an extended look into other crucial RouterOS features and concepts.

**Document Title:** MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 Configuration for SOHO IP Addressing & Extended Features

**Introduction**

This document provides a comprehensive guide to configuring IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6) and various related features on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 device, suitable for a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environment. We will cover basic configurations, advanced concepts, troubleshooting techniques, and security best practices. The focus will be on hands-on implementation using the CLI and Winbox, with detailed explanations of MikroTik-specific commands and concepts.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:**
*   A SOHO environment with a single internet connection.
*   Internal network using private IPv4 addresses.
*   Optional IPv6 connectivity if available from the ISP.
*   A few wired and wireless devices requiring internet access and LAN connectivity.
*   Basic firewall protection to prevent unwanted inbound connections.
*   DHCP server for automatic IP assignment to client devices.
*   DNS server for local and external name resolution.

**MikroTik Requirements:**
*   RouterOS v7.11 or later installed on a compatible MikroTik router.
*   One WAN interface connected to the internet.
*   One or more LAN interfaces for internal network.
*   Basic familiarity with MikroTik RouterOS.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

Here's a step-by-step guide using both CLI and Winbox.

**Step 1: Initial Setup (CLI)**
*   Access your MikroTik device via SSH or serial console.
*   Login with the default user (`admin`) and an empty password (if new).
*   Set a strong password for the `admin` user.

```mikrotik-cli
/user set admin password=your_strong_password
```
**Step 2: Interface Configuration (CLI/Winbox)**
*   **Identify your WAN and LAN interfaces.** Typically `ether1` is your WAN interface. You will need to look at the router's markings or use `/interface print` to identify the interfaces.
*   Rename them for easy management.

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/interface set ether1 name=wan
/interface set ether2 name=lan
```

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to "Interfaces" in the left-hand menu.
*  Double-click each interface and rename them.

**Step 3: IPv4 Addressing (CLI/Winbox)**

*  Configure IPv4 address for your WAN interface from ISP. Use DHCP Client to obtain an IP address automatically or use Static IP configuration.

**DHCP Client (CLI):**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip dhcp-client add interface=wan disabled=no
```

**Static IP (CLI):**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip address add address=192.168.1.10/24 interface=wan
/ip route add gateway=192.168.1.1
```

*   Configure a private IPv4 address for your LAN interface.

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=lan
```

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to "IP" -> "Addresses" and add addresses to the appropriate interfaces.

**Step 4: DHCP Server (CLI/Winbox)**

*  Configure a DHCP server for automatic IP assignment on your LAN

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip pool add name=dhcp_pool ranges=192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254
/ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp1 address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=lan
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 gateway=192.168.88.1 dns-server=192.168.88.1
```

**Winbox:**
*   Navigate to "IP" -> "DHCP Server" and add a server, pool and network.

**Step 5: IPv6 Addressing (CLI/Winbox)**

*   If your ISP provides IPv6, enable the IPv6 protocol on the WAN interface using the DHCP-Client. This is common.

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ipv6 dhcp-client add interface=wan request=address,prefix disabled=no
```

* Configure a unique IPv6 subnet for LAN.

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ipv6 address add address=2001:db8:100:1::1/64 interface=lan
```

**Winbox:**
* Navigate to "IPv6" -> "Addresses" and add addresses to the appropriate interfaces.

**Step 6: Firewall (CLI/Winbox)**

*   Configure a basic firewall for NAT and for secure device management access.

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=wan action=masquerade
/ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=22,8291 action=accept in-interface=lan comment="Allow Winbox & SSH from LAN"
/ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=tcp dst-port=22,8291 action=drop comment="Drop other access"
```
**Winbox:**
* Navigate to "IP" -> "Firewall" and add the necessary rules.

**Step 7: DNS (CLI/Winbox)**

*  Configure DNS settings

**CLI:**
```mikrotik-cli
/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes servers=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
```
**Winbox:**
* Navigate to "IP" -> "DNS" and configure the settings

    ```

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** In MikroTik, bridging combines multiple interfaces into a single logical interface. It is essentially acting as a switch on layer 2. This enables all devices connected to the bridge to communicate with each other on the same broadcast domain.
*   **Routing:** Routing determines how network traffic travels between networks. MikroTik uses a routing table, where entries specify the next hop to reach a destination network. RouterOS uses a route selection process to choose the best route if multiple paths are available.
*   **Firewall:** The firewall provides a rule-based mechanism to filter network traffic based on various criteria (source, destination, port, protocol etc). It is used for security and traffic management.
*   **Connection Tracking:** RouterOS tracks active network connections, which enables the firewall to allow related traffic. NAT functionality is dependent on connection tracking.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Change default passwords:** Always change the default admin password.
*   **Disable unused services:** Disable services like Telnet, API without HTTPS.
*   **Use strong encryption:** Use strong passwords and encryption for VPNs.
*   **Limit access to Winbox/SSH:** Control access using firewall rules and specific IPs.
*   **Regular updates:** Keep RouterOS and firmware up to date.
*   **Disable default ports:** Change default port for SSH if needed.
*   **Implement regular backups:** Back up your RouterOS configuration
*   **Use firewall:** Protect your device from outside attacks.
