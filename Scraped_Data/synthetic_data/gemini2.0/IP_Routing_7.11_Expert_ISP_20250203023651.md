Okay, let's dive deep into this comprehensive MikroTik routing configuration and documentation for an ISP network using RouterOS 7.11 (or 6.48/7.x).  We will focus on the IP routing scenario you provided with subnet 50.51.114.0/24 on interface ether-76, and then expand into all the areas you've requested.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario & Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** An ISP needs to route traffic for the 50.51.114.0/24 subnet out of the interface `ether-76`. This could be a downstream customer network, a network segment that needs to be accessible from the core router, or simply a dedicated subnet for a certain purpose. We will configure basic static routing and address allocation.
*   **MikroTik Requirements:**
    *   RouterOS 7.11 or any 7.x version (or 6.48 for demonstration compatibility).
    *   The router must have `ether-76` configured as an active interface.
    *   No NAT is configured for this example, the assumption is that the subnet is routed directly and the responsibility for NAT lies further up in the network.
    *   The focus is purely on routing; advanced features such as firewalling and QoS will be covered in separate sections.
    *   We assume that IP address assignment on the subnet is handled by other devices (DHCP servers or static). We will show how you can use RouterOS for IP pools and DHCP server later, for illustration.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

**CLI Implementation**
   * **Step 1: Access Your Router**: Connect to your MikroTik router via SSH or Serial connection. Alternatively, you can use Winbox.
   * **Step 2: Configure the IP Address on the Interface**: Add an IP address to the `ether-76` interface. Let's assume we are giving the router an IP of 50.51.114.1/24 on ether-76.
   * **Step 3: Check connectivity:** Test connectivity to the router on the configured address and check routes before adding any routes.

```bash
/ip address
add address=50.51.114.1/24 interface=ether-76
/ip address print
```

```bash
/ping 50.51.114.1
```

```bash
/ip route print
```

   * **Step 4: Add a static route to the subnet**. If we want to direct traffic for this subnet to a specific interface, we can do that. In our case, any traffic destined for 50.51.114.0/24 must be routed out of `ether-76`.
     * **Note:** This configuration example assumes that ether-76 is a direct connection to the 50.51.114.0/24 network, not that this network is reachable over another router.
   * **Step 5: Test and verify:** Use `ping` and `traceroute` to test connectivity.

**Winbox Implementation**

   * **Step 1: Access Your Router**: Connect to your MikroTik router using Winbox.
   * **Step 2: Configure the IP Address on the Interface**: Go to **IP** -> **Addresses**. Click the "+" button. In the *Address* field, add `50.51.114.1/24`. In the *Interface* dropdown, select `ether-76`. Click **Apply** then **OK**.
   * **Step 3: Test**: Go to Tools -> Ping and enter the router's IP. Verify the ping is successful. Go to IP -> Routes and verify there are connected routes.
   * **Step 4: No Static Route needed**. No route needs to be added at this step because the network is directly connected and the route is created automatically.
   * **Step 5: Test and Verify**: Use Tools->Ping and Tools->Traceroute to test connectivity to other IP addresses on the 50.51.114.0/24 network.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

```bash
# Set IP address on interface ether-76
/ip address add address=50.51.114.1/24 interface=ether-76

#Optional: Add a static route if you require specific gateway routing
# /ip route add dst-address=50.51.114.0/24 gateway=50.51.114.2  (Assuming a gateway IP)

# Print IP address configuration
/ip address print

# Print routing table
/ip route print

#Optional: View configuration specific to ether-76
/interface ethernet print where name=ether-76
```

**Parameters Explanation:**

*   `/ip address add`: Adds a new IP address.
    *   `address`: The IP address and subnet mask in CIDR notation (e.g., 50.51.114.1/24).
    *   `interface`: The name of the interface (e.g., `ether-76`).
*   `/ip address print`: Displays the current IP address configurations.
*   `/ip route add`: Adds a static route.
    *   `dst-address`: The destination network address (e.g., `50.51.114.0/24`).
    *   `gateway`: The next-hop IP address to reach the destination (optional).
*   `/ip route print`: Displays the current routing table.
* `/interface ethernet print`: Shows interface parameters
    * `where name=ether-76`: only print details for the ether-76 interface

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall:** Forgetting to enable the interface.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface ethernet print` to check if the interface is enabled (check `enabled=yes`). Use `/interface ethernet enable ether-76` to enable it.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect subnet mask, leading to incorrect routing.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Double-check the subnet mask and address assigned to the interface. Incorrect masks will lead to misconfigured network routes. Use `/ip address print` to verify.
*   **Pitfall:** Missing default gateway.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**  If the destination is not directly connected, a default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) is usually required. Verify this in `/ip route print`. Add a default gateway using `/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=<gateway_ip>`.
*   **Pitfall:** Firewall rules blocking traffic.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check `/ip firewall filter print`. Temporary disable the firewall with `/ip firewall filter disable numbers=all` to see if the firewall is the culprit.
*   **Error Example:**
    *   **Error:** `invalid value for argument address`.
    *   **Cause:** Incorrectly formatted IP address string or IP conflict.
    *   **Solution:** Check the format of the IP address string and ensure it's not used already.
*   **Diagnostics:**
    *   `ping <ip_address>`: Test connectivity to specific IP.
    *   `traceroute <ip_address>`: Trace the path packets take.
    *   `torch interface=ether-76`: Capture packets on `ether-76` for real-time analysis. Useful to see what traffic goes in and out.
    *   `/tool profile`: See which parts of the system are taking up the most processing time. This tool is essential for detecting bottlenecks and optimizing the device.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Step 1: Ping the interface IP:** Use `/ping 50.51.114.1` to check local connectivity.
*   **Step 2: Ping other IP on the subnet:** Ping a client IP address within the 50.51.114.0/24 network using `/ping 50.51.114.x`.
*   **Step 3: Traceroute:** Use `traceroute <destination_IP>` to check the path of packets.
*   **Step 4: Torch:** Capture live traffic on the interface with `torch interface=ether-76`.
*   **Step 5: Check Routes:** Use `/ip route print` to verify that routes are set up correctly.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools**:
    *   **Purpose:** Define ranges of IP addresses for dynamic allocation (DHCP).
    *   **Example:** `/ip pool add name=subnet_50_pool ranges=50.51.114.10-50.51.114.254`
*   **DHCP Server:**
    *   **Purpose:** Dynamically assign IP addresses to clients.
    *   **Example:**
```bash
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=subnet_50_pool interface=ether-76 name=dhcp_subnet_50
/ip dhcp-server network add address=50.51.114.0/24 gateway=50.51.114.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```
*   **Limitations:** Limited by the device's CPU, memory, and interface capabilities. High traffic can cause bottlenecks.
*   **Less Common Features:**
    *   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** Isolates routing tables, useful for complex network segmentation.
    *   **Policy Routing:** Allows routing decisions based on criteria other than destination address.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

*   **Note:** REST API access needs to be enabled on your MikroTik under IP->Services.
*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address`
*   **Example:**

   ```bash
   # Using curl in linux to list the addresses. Authentication to be added as appropriate.
   curl -k -u user:password -H "Content-Type: application/json"  https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address
   ```

   ```json
   # Example response:
   [
    {
      ".id": "*1",
      "address": "50.51.114.1/24",
      "interface": "ether-76",
      "network": "50.51.114.0",
      "actual-interface": "ether-76",
      "disabled": "false",
      "invalid": "false"
    }
    ]
   ```
   ```bash
   # To create IP address, use POST request
   curl -k -u user:password -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"address":"50.51.114.2/24","interface":"ether-76"}'  https://<router_ip>/rest/ip/address
   ```

   ```json
   # Example response:
   {
     ".id": "*2"
   }
   ```
*   **Note**: To find full set of commands and parameters for API, navigate to `/rest/` in your browser or use the curl command above without specifying `/ip/address`.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing:**  Each interface needs a unique IP address to participate in the network. The `/24` denotes the subnet mask, which determines how many hosts are part of this specific broadcast domain. The subnet defines the network space and the addresses used within.
*   **IP Routing:**  The router checks the routing table to determine the next hop for each packet. When a destination IP is on a connected network, the router forwards the packet out that specific interface. The routing table contains entries for connected networks and static routes. The routing table is checked before firewall filters and then NAT.
*   **Bridging:** Not relevant in the example, but bridging combines multiple interfaces into a single layer 2 broadcast domain. This is different from routing which works at the layer 3 (network) level.
*   **Firewall:** Rules to inspect and allow or deny packets based on source, destination, ports, etc. It is a stateful firewall that maintains session information for traffic filtering.
*   **Why Specific Commands?** The `/ip address add` command defines the interface and the IP address that identifies that interface. The `/ip route add` command instructs the router on how to reach a specific network. These commands are foundational for network configuration. The reason we use `/ip route print` is to display existing routes.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use strong and unique passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable any IP services that are not needed (e.g., telnet, ftp).
*   **Restrict Winbox and API Access:** Limit access by IP addresses or specific source networks using firewall rules.
*   **RouterOS Updates:** Regularly update to the latest stable RouterOS version. This fixes bugs, provides new features, and closes security vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strong input and forward rules to limit traffic coming into the router and traversing the router.
*   **Disable Neighbor Discovery:** Disable neighbor discovery for devices on public network.
*   **Use HTTPS for API Access:** Use secure TLS connections when using the API.
