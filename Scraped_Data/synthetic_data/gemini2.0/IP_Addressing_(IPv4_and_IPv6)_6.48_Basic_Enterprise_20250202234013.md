Okay, let's craft a comprehensive document on IP Addressing for MikroTik RouterOS, covering the specified areas with detailed examples, explanations, and best practices. This is going to be a substantial document, so let's break it down step-by-step.

# MikroTik RouterOS IP Addressing and Networking - Enterprise Level

This document details IP addressing, routing, and related networking concepts within MikroTik RouterOS, targeted at an enterprise environment and focusing on versions 6.48 or later (6.x or 7.x). We will cover basic to advanced configurations, focusing on practical implementation, security, and troubleshooting.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:** A medium-sized enterprise has a MikroTik router acting as their primary gateway. They require:

*   **Internal Network:** Separate VLANs for different departments (e.g., IT, Sales, Finance). Each VLAN should have its own subnet.
*   **External Connection:** A public IPv4 address and assignment of public IPv6 subnet.
*   **DHCP:** Automatic IP address assignment for devices within each VLAN.
*   **Firewall:** Secure access control, restricting traffic between VLANs and to/from the internet.
*   **Routing:** Static and dynamic routing as needed.
*   **Basic Monitoring:** Ability to monitor bandwidth, connectivity, and log errors.
*   **Remote Management:** Secure remote management using Winbox and SSH.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 6.48 or newer (6.x or 7.x).
*   **Hardware:** RouterBOARD with multiple ethernet interfaces supporting VLANs.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced MikroTik knowledge.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI/Winbox)

We'll demonstrate using CLI. Winbox users can adapt based on UI equivalents of the CLI commands.

**Step 1: Configure VLAN Interfaces**

   *   Create VLAN interfaces for each department. We'll use VLAN IDs 10 (IT), 20 (Sales), and 30 (Finance).
   *   We will create these on the ether2 interface, which is a trunk port to a capable switch.

     ```mikrotik
     /interface vlan
     add name=vlan10 vlan-id=10 interface=ether2 comment="IT VLAN"
     add name=vlan20 vlan-id=20 interface=ether2 comment="Sales VLAN"
     add name=vlan30 vlan-id=30 interface=ether2 comment="Finance VLAN"
     ```

**Step 2: Configure IP Addresses**

   *   Assign IPv4 addresses to the VLAN interfaces.
   *  We will assume our provider provides:
          * Public IP: 203.0.113.10/24, GW 203.0.113.1
          * Public IPv6: 2001:db8::/48, GW: 2001:db8::1.
    * We will assign a /24 for IPv4 for the internal subnets and a /64 for IPv6.

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=192.168.10.1/24 interface=vlan10 comment="IT VLAN IP"
    add address=192.168.20.1/24 interface=vlan20 comment="Sales VLAN IP"
    add address=192.168.30.1/24 interface=vlan30 comment="Finance VLAN IP"
    add address=203.0.113.10/24 interface=ether1 comment="Public IPv4"
    add address=2001:db8::10/64 interface=ether1 comment="Public IPv6"
    add address=2001:db8:10::1/64 interface=vlan10 comment="IT VLAN IPv6"
    add address=2001:db8:20::1/64 interface=vlan20 comment="Sales VLAN IPv6"
    add address=2001:db8:30::1/64 interface=vlan30 comment="Finance VLAN IPv6"
    ```
**Step 3: Configure IP Pools**

   *   Create IP pools for dynamic address assignment on each VLAN.

     ```mikrotik
     /ip pool
     add name=pool_it ranges=192.168.10.10-192.168.10.254 comment="IT DHCP Pool"
     add name=pool_sales ranges=192.168.20.10-192.168.20.254 comment="Sales DHCP Pool"
     add name=pool_finance ranges=192.168.30.10-192.168.30.254 comment="Finance DHCP Pool"
     ```

**Step 4: Configure DHCP Servers**

   *  Set up DHCP server for each VLAN.

     ```mikrotik
     /ip dhcp-server
     add address-pool=pool_it interface=vlan10 lease-time=1d name=dhcp_it comment="DHCP for IT"
     add address-pool=pool_sales interface=vlan20 lease-time=1d name=dhcp_sales comment="DHCP for Sales"
     add address-pool=pool_finance interface=vlan30 lease-time=1d name=dhcp_finance comment="DHCP for Finance"

     /ip dhcp-server network
     add address=192.168.10.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.10.1 dhcp-server=dhcp_it comment="IT DHCP Network"
     add address=192.168.20.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.20.1 dhcp-server=dhcp_sales comment="Sales DHCP Network"
     add address=192.168.30.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.30.1 dhcp-server=dhcp_finance comment="Finance DHCP Network"
     ```

**Step 5: Configure IPv4 Routing**

   *   Set the default route for internet access via the external interface.

     ```mikrotik
     /ip route
     add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=203.0.113.1 comment="Default Gateway IPv4"
     ```

**Step 6: Configure IPv6 Routing**

   *   Set the default route for internet access via the external interface.

     ```mikrotik
     /ipv6 route
     add dst-address=::/0 gateway=2001:db8::1 comment="Default Gateway IPv6"
     ```

**Step 7: Configure IPv4 Firewall**
*   NAT the internal traffic to the external interface.

     ```mikrotik
     /ip firewall nat
     add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1 comment="Masquerade internal IPs"
     ```
*    Enable basic firewall security.

     ```mikrotik
     /ip firewall filter
     # Allow established and related connections
     add chain=input connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established Input"
     add chain=forward connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established Forward"

     # Allow ICMP
     add chain=input protocol=icmp comment="Allow ICMP"
     add chain=forward protocol=icmp comment="Allow ICMP Forward"

     # Default deny for input and forward chains (Security Best Practice)
     add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop All Input"
     add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop All Forward"
     ```
**Step 8: Configure IPv6 Firewall**
*    Enable basic firewall security for IPv6.
     ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 firewall filter
     # Allow established and related connections
     add chain=input connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established Input IPv6"
     add chain=forward connection-state=established,related comment="Allow Established Forward IPv6"

     # Allow ICMPv6
     add chain=input protocol=icmpv6 comment="Allow ICMPv6"
     add chain=forward protocol=icmpv6 comment="Allow ICMPv6 Forward"

    # Default deny for input and forward chains (Security Best Practice)
     add chain=input action=drop comment="Drop All Input IPv6"
     add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop All Forward IPv6"
    ```
**Step 9: Basic Security**
