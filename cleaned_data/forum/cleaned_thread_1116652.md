## Initial Question
I've created a wireguard connection using the mikrotik app "back to home". It works straight. Very useful function.But when the client is not connected the log in full of row like:
```
memory wireguard,info back-to-home-vpn:[peer1]XXXXXXXXXHandshakeforpeer didnotcomplete after20attempts,giving upAre useless.This fulls the 1000 rows of logging in a night...Can be disabled this useless message from wireguard back-to-home ?The right way will be a row of log when the client has connected and a row when the client disconnects...How can I have a message in the log only when the client connects and one when it disconnects?
