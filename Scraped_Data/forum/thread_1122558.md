Well, one can't expect fire-breathing donkey to understand the difference. After all, in Canada they don't have any kind of president, only Governor General and Prime Minister.

Okay wise asses, I have corrected my faux pas.  Maybe I was testing if you were paying attention. '=)Now besides Vicktors for Minister of Arts,  peruse the other MT staff and decide which cabinet post they should get!!

Attempt4:   Why did I volunteer to attend this event for Viktors......I think the PM's drug-sniff dogs excluded him from the event.

Attempt4:   Why did I volunteer to attend this event for Viktors......I think the PM's drug-sniff dogs excluded him from the event.... it reads "volunteer" ... which begs for question: whom did drug-sniffing dogs exclude: Normunds, Viktors, both or themselves?
