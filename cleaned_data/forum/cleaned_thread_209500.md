## Initial Question
Author: Tue Jul 23, 2024 4:00 pm
Hello, We are using CRS318-16P-2S+ mikrotik device and I am facing looped packet issues in the device on ether3 and ether5. I have crossed check my STP configurations in the network devices connected to it but all seems fine from there. Kindly do provide assistance as it's been quite a long since I have been trying to overcome this issue.Errors:interface warning ether3: bridge RX looped packet - MAC 48:8f:5a:c6:xx:xx -> 33:33:00:00:00:01 ETHERTYPE 0x86ddinterface warning ether3: bridge RX looped packet - MAC 48:8f:5a:c6:xx:xx -> 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cc ETHERTYPE 0x0004interface warning ether3: bridge RX looped packet - MAC 48:8f:5a:c6:xx:xx -> ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff ETHERTYPE 0x0800 IP UDP 172.x.x.x:5678 -> 255.255.255.255:5678Note: 172.x.x.x is my mikrotik device's IP. ---

The issue has been resolved and I'm updating it so may be it can help someone in case they are facing the same issue.I read countless threads where people discussed about this error but didn't get any valid clue that would make sense.We have redundancies in our network and have configured RSTP throughout the mikrotik devices and in some devices MSTP (ubnt switches).I checked all the devices in the extended network connected via ether3 and found these loop errors in those mikrotik switches.The broadcast loop messages are a result of these simple loop messages which I was encountering in my extended network equipment(Mikrotik), so, I reconfigured one of my mikrotik switches in a correct way (It was configured before me and hardly anything was connected to it, so, initially I didn't pay much attention to it) and never faced these errors again.But there was another mikrotik switch which had redundancies and RSTP was configured and it was correctly configured but I was still facing these loop messages on two of my ports(Both had wireless radios connecting the site to the other sites). The other sites had UBNT switches and MSTP configured. The root port selection was always from among these two ports which I confirmed from the logs.So, what I did was I made another port as a root port by adjusting the port costs and made both these ports as an alternative port. But still one port would still go into the learning, forwarding and discarding state even when it was an alternative port. So, I disabled this port as I had redundancies in my network. Since, then everything is working normally and I never faced packet drops issue again.One more thing which I will be doing now is configuring RSTP in the UBNT switches as well to maintain one standard spanning tree protocol throughout the network.These loop warning/error messages are serious threat to the network and can make you loose access to the equipment like I was facing it.
