Disable neighbor discovery and SLAAC will stop working. By the way you request both an address and a prefix as well, if you don’t need an address for the router perhaps only request the prefix.

Disable neighbor discovery and SLAAC will stop working.Ok, I have now disabled ND with this:Code:Select all/ipv6 ndset[finddefault=yes]disabled=yesWith this, IPv6 Router advertisement stops on the affected VLAN.But why do I need to disable ND? Without disabling ND the Router is doing the IPv6 Router advertisement. But just on one VLAN/Interface! On other VLAN/Interfaces it doesn't do it with ND enabled. This doesn't really make sense to me.

Did you previously have an IPv6 address assigned to the VLAN in question? It may be that if you add an address and then remove it the Mikrotik requires a reboot to stop the advertisment. There a a few things where a reboot is required to get the state consistent after changes, in this case it could be radvd doesn't get notified that the address has been removed and continues to advertise it.
