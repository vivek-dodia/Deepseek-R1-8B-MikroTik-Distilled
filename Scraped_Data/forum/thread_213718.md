As the documentation states, you can always downgrade. But not below factory installed version.What does/system/resource/printshow?

SOLVED, I found a way around:before downgrading from 7.13 to a pre-7.12 version, you have to remove the wireless package using the following command:/system/package/uninstall wirelessthen, you have to reboot, and only after this step you can upload the ros .npk files and perform the downgrade using the following command:/system/package/downgrade

Thx! (I hope this procedure will also help others in the future).Regarding the reasons for the downgrade:1) I like to have all production devices running the same version, which is, in my case, 7.11.3 for the time being. I am still craving for a ROS7 long-term to be released...2) I always read the release notes carefully, and as long as I don't need new features and there are no related bug or security fixes in the new firmware that would apply to my infrastructure, there is no point of upgrading. Security fixes aside, I always prefer proven stability (for my specific environment) over new versions full of new features and inevitably, new undocumented bugs.3) I do test newer versions on non-critical devices from time to time. This is why I was running 7.16 on the LtAP mini RB912R-2nD-LT, but I experienced some nasty bugs with the script execution (which kinda prouves my point 2), so I had to roll-back.

I too wish there was a long-term channel, since I too like more time after "stable" before upgrading production things... since sometime "stable" isn't quite stable.But I suspect your #3 problem isn't going away, since they have changed some of the permissions scheme (i.e. some scripts need "policy" and/or "test" rights in recent releases), among other subtle changes that may require manual mitigation during upgrade.This is why I was running 7.16 on the LtAP mini RB912R-2nD-LT, but I experienced some nasty bugs with the script execution (which kinda prouves my point 2), so I had to roll-back.So whether they are "bugs" or security/other "fixes" may be a matter of opinion.    So you may still want to get to the bottom of the root causes of script errors, since any actual security fixes would likely only go into a "stable" ... since, unfortunately, there isn't a long-term to use if there was a real security patch.Anyway, good work figuring out you needed to remove wireless package to downgrade - logical in hindsight - but not sure I'd figure that one out before giving up and using netinstall.
