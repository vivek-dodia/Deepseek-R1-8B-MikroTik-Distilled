Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive documentation for MikroTik RouterOS, focusing on the specified scenario and covering a wide range of related topics. This will be a detailed, step-by-step guide suitable for an experienced user.

## MikroTik RouterOS Configuration for IP Routing on a Subnet

This document outlines a basic configuration for a MikroTik router, focusing on assigning an IP address to an interface (`wlan-47`) within the specified subnet (53.144.40.0/24). We'll then explore related topics and configurations, gradually moving to more advanced concepts.

**Configuration Level:** Basic
**Network Scale:** SMB
**RouterOS Version:** 6.48 (Compatible with 7.x for most configurations)
**Subnet:** 53.144.40.0/24
**Interface:** wlan-47

### 1. Comprehensive Scenario and Requirements

**Scenario:**

We have a MikroTik router acting as a central point for a small to medium-sized business. One of the wireless interfaces, `wlan-47`, needs to be assigned an IP address from the 53.144.40.0/24 subnet. This interface might connect to a specific department's wireless network, guest WiFi, or a dedicated IoT network. The requirements are simple â€“ to enable IP communication within this network, and enable basic internet connectivity.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   Assign an IP address to the `wlan-47` interface within the given subnet.
*   Enable DHCP server on the `wlan-47` interface.
*   Configure NAT for Internet access through another interface (assumed `ether1`).
*   Understand and document the basic concepts behind the IP routing stack.
*   Provide examples of troubleshooting using MikroTik tools.

### 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

Here's how to configure this on your MikroTik router using the CLI:

1.  **Connect to your RouterOS:** Connect to your MikroTik router via SSH, Telnet, or the Winbox GUI. In this example, we will use CLI via SSH.

2.  **Assign IP Address:**
    *   Use the `/ip address add` command to assign an IP address to the `wlan-47` interface.  We will use the IP `53.144.40.1/24` as a default gateway address for this interface.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=53.144.40.1/24 interface=wlan-47
    ```

3.  **Enable DHCP Server:**
    * Create an IP Pool
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=dhcp_pool_wlan ranges=53.144.40.10-53.144.40.254
    ```

    * Configure the DHCP Server:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool_wlan interface=wlan-47 name=dhcp_wlan
    ```

    * Configure DHCP network.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=53.144.40.0/24 gateway=53.144.40.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
    ```

4. **Enable NAT:**
     * Assuming your internet connection goes out through ether1, add the following NAT rule.
     ```mikrotik
     /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
     ```

**Important Notes:**

*   **Interface Naming:**  Ensure that the interface named `wlan-47` exists on your router and is the intended interface for this configuration. You can verify existing interfaces using `/interface print`.
*   **IP Address Conflicts:** If there is another device with the same IP address, it will cause communication issues.
*   **Network Address**: Using .0 is the network address and will cause issues. Using .1 is the Gateway address and you will not be able to use it on a device behind the RouterOS firewall.
*   **Winbox GUI:** You can perform the same steps via Winbox by navigating to `IP` -> `Addresses` and adding the address, `IP` -> `DHCP Server` and adding new dhcp-server, and `IP` -> `Firewall` -> `NAT` and adding a new NAT rule.

### 3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration

```mikrotik
# Set IP address on wlan-47
/ip address add address=53.144.40.1/24 interface=wlan-47

# Create a dhcp pool
/ip pool add name=dhcp_pool_wlan ranges=53.144.40.10-53.144.40.254

# Create a dhcp server
/ip dhcp-server add address-pool=dhcp_pool_wlan interface=wlan-47 name=dhcp_wlan

# Configure dhcp network
/ip dhcp-server network add address=53.144.40.0/24 gateway=53.144.40.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4

# Enable NAT masquerade on ether1 (replace ether1 with your internet interface)
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
```

### 4. Common MikroTik Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

Here are some common issues you might encounter:

*   **Incorrect Interface Name:** Double-check the interface name. Use `/interface print` to verify.
    *   **Error Scenario:** The IP address won't be assigned to the desired interface, and clients cannot access the network.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Correct the interface name in the configuration.
*   **IP Address Conflict:** If you try to use an IP that is already in use, you will not be able to ping or access the internet.
    *  **Error Scenario:** No communication is possible, or communication might be intermittent.
    *  **Troubleshooting:** Use `Tools -> Ping` within Winbox or command line `/tool ping 53.144.40.1` to test for conflicts.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Incorrect firewall rules can block traffic.
    *   **Error Scenario:** Clients connected to `wlan-47` cannot access the internet.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Examine the firewall rules using `/ip firewall filter print` and ensure that traffic from your new subnet is allowed.
* **DHCP Issues:**
    * **Error Scenario**: Devices fail to obtain IP addresses.
    * **Troubleshooting**: Examine DHCP server logs `/log print topics=dhcp,debug`

**Diagnostics Tools:**

*   **`ping`:** `/tool ping 53.144.40.1` tests reachability.
*   **`traceroute`:** `/tool traceroute 8.8.8.8` shows the network path.
*   **`torch`:** `/tool torch interface=wlan-47` captures packets for analysis.
*   **`log`:** `/log print` reviews system logs for errors.
*   **`/interface monitor`** watches interface statistics
*   **`/ip dhcp-server leases print`** Shows lease information

### 5. Verification and Testing

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Check Assigned IP:** Use `/ip address print` to confirm that the address `53.144.40.1/24` is correctly assigned to the `wlan-47` interface.
2.  **Ping Router IP:** From a computer on the same subnet, ping the router's IP (53.144.40.1) to verify connectivity.
3.  **Test Internet Access:** From a client connected to `wlan-47`, test internet connectivity by visiting a website or pinging a public IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

**Example:**

*   On a connected client, run:
    ```bash
    ping 53.144.40.1
    ping 8.8.8.8
    ```
