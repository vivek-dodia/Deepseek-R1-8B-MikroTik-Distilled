From the router, you have /tool/fetch mode=sftp (or =ftp):https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... 8514/FetchOtherwise from Linux/etc, scp will work like ssh.  But AFAIK there is no scp from router to another device.

scp worked.I was using:scp admin@192.168.80.1:/file/cluster.txt.rsc /home/bret/cluster.txt.rsc  (errored out, assumed the /file was location)This worked:scp admin@192.168.80.1:/cluster.txt.rsc /home/bret/cluster.txt.rscAppreciate the suggestion. Stayed with it. Now I'll try importing.Cold here in Northern Cal.
