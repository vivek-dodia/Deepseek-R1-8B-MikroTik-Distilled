/interface wireless
set [ find default-name=wlan1 ] default-authentication=no

add interface=wlan1 mac-address=08:55:31:E4:E4:C9 comment="haplite 2ghz only"
```

Given that reducing TX-power of wlan1 to 10dbm did not improve the situation. Now I am back at a simple access-list solution. Not that optimal - but it works for now. I refuse to connect to 2.4ghz if signal is better than -70. It maybe could work with -60 or -65 too - but I need to slowly go down and watch the behaviour.I have only 2 devices that only support 2.4ghz band. HAP-lite and MAP-lite. The map is quite far away and has a signal of -75 due to the distance itself. The HAPlite is whitelisted.Code:Select all

```
IF device already connected to wlan2 AND want to connect to wlan1 AND wlan2-signal is better than -80: DENY connect to wlan1
```

One thing I noticed/observed:Some of my clients (Android, Macbook) first connect to 5ghz and switch over to 2.4ghz within approx a minute after connecting to 5ghz.For me this looks like, that these devices prefer 5ghz by default. They connect. Then they find 2.4ghz with "better" signal and switch over.--Has someone a script, that can handle following scenario?Pseudocode:Code:Select all

Well the power settings on a MT are not simple with the later devices and higher RouterOS versions.What I assume as what it does ......- TX power, certainly in Europe, is limited by the regulatory domain max EIRP (20dBm for 2.4GHz, 23dBm and 20 dBm for 5GHz indoor only freq, 27 dBm for 5GHz also outdoor freq)See CLI: " interface wireless info country-info etsi" or replace etsi with your country- TX power is limited at the higher MCS encoding because of the needed signal quality (see data sheets)- TX power used to be given as information in "Current TX power", and power could be set per MCS. Now only "all rate fixed" can be used. Andno feedback is given.The only line of information visible in RouterOS GUI is in the "status". All possible values of this can be seen with: "/interface wireless info allowed-channels"It is the calculation of the EIRP limit, reduced with the antenna gain filled in or set by default. In text below wAP has "antenna gain=2" setAs far as I verified there is no reduction for the multiple antenna in the status info,  not even for 2.4GHz "n" where it is set "per antenna", versus "ac" where it is total (see wiki)The EIRP table values get sometimes updated with ROS releasesCode:Select allThe manual TX-power "all rates fixed" filled in value, does not change this status line. So there you can not see what the TX-power used actually is.The value in the status line will be the maximum used !But as the wiki says you should set the TX-power per antenna for all protocols except "ac" chipsets where you should give the total. "802.11n wireless chipsets represent power per chain and the 802.11ac wireless chipsets represent the total power". This does not fit with the above data, which is always the total power, or not? The multiple antenna must be compensated for, so with 2 it is 3dBm lower per antenna.And with no feedback, what are we doing when we set manual TX-power to 17 , on "n" chipsets and what on "ac" chipsets?The max is 'status_dBm - 3dBm' ??

Based on that I can conclude that I won't be able to increase the power. Then what are other ways to improve the situation that devices switch to 2.4GHz though 5GHz RSSI is quite acceptable?http://prntscr.com/26thu4f

Well the power settings on a MT are not simple with the later devices and higher RouterOS versions.What I assume as what it does ......- TX power, certainly in Europe, is limited by the regulatory domain max EIRP (20dBm for 2.4GHz, 23dBm and 20 dBm for 5GHz indoor only freq, 27 dBm for 5GHz also outdoor freq)See CLI: " interface wireless info country-info etsi" or replace etsi with your country- TX power is limited at the higher MCS encoding because of the needed signal quality (see data sheets)- TX power used to be given as information in "Current TX power", and power could be set per MCS. Now only "all rate fixed" can be used. Andno feedback is given.The only line of information visible in RouterOS GUI is in the "status". All possible values of this can be seen with: "/interface wireless info allowed-channels"It is the calculation of the EIRP limit, reduced with the antenna gain filled in or set by default. In text below wAP has "antenna gain=2" setAs far as I verified there is no reduction for the multiple antenna in the status info,  not even for 2.4GHz "n" where it is set "per antenna", versus "ac" where it is total (see wiki)The EIRP table values get sometimes updated with ROS releasesCode:Select allThe manual TX-power "all rates fixed" filled in value, does not change this status line. So there you can not see what the TX-power used actually is.The value in the status line will be the maximum used !But as the wiki says you should set the TX-power per antenna for all protocols except "ac" chipsets where you should give the total. "802.11n wireless chipsets represent power per chain and the 802.11ac wireless chipsets represent the total power". This does not fit with the above data, which is always the total power, or not? The multiple antenna must be compensated for, so with 2 it is 3dBm lower per antenna.And with no feedback, what are we doing when we set manual TX-power to 17 , on "n" chipsets and what on "ac" chipsets?The max is 'status_dBm - 3dBm' ??Thank you for your detailed answer. Based on that I can conclude that I won't be able to increase the power. Then what are other ways to improve the situation that devices switch to 2.4GHz though 5GHz RSSI is quite acceptable?http://prntscr.com/26thu4f

You did not mean those whole config, right?At the moment i am doing a workaround with access list by blocking strong signal from 2.4GhzCode:Select all

07:17:30 wireless,info <station-MAC>@<old_WiFi_radio> roamed to <station-MAC>@<new_WiFi_radio>, signal strength -75
 07:17:30 wireless,debug <station-MAC>@<old_WiFi_radio> disassociated, connected to other interface, signal strength -88

```
15:53:58 wireless,info <station-MAC>@<old_WiFi_radio>: disconnected, extensive data loss, signal strength -75
```

Seems that connect-priority 0/1 improved the situation. Devices now do switch to 5ghz, but it does not seem due to actual steering, but because they eventually take that decision themselves.WiFi standards (802.11anything) don't standardize handovers (at decision of network entity), they standardize steering ... which helps device to decide if and when to switch to different BSSID inside same SSID. The difference between no steering and steering more or less boils down to duration of connectivity outage during switch over (with steering it's pretty short, without steering it can take seconds). But decision is always device's.The difference is also seen in logs. With steering logs will say something likeCode:Select allso "roamed to ... disassociated".And without steering, logs will say something likeCode:Select allso "disconnected".
