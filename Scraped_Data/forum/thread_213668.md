When configuring DHCP Option 6 (DNS Servers) on 7.17rc3 (not sure if it occurs on prior releases), providing a comma-separated list of IP addresses enclosed in single quotes (the correct format) results in the DHCP server incorrectly interpreting the ASCII representation of the IP address string as IP addresses themselves. This leads to clients receiving nonsensical DNS server IP addresses.Code:Select allSteps to Reproduce(including somewhat obvious steps)Create aDHCP OptionCode:Select allCreate aDHCP Option SetCode:Select allIdentify aTarget Host: Determine the MAC address of a client device that will be used for testing.Create aStatic DHCP LeaseCode:Select allRenew DHCP Leaseon the ClientObserved BehaviorInstead of receiving the configured DNS servers (e.g., 192.168.1.105 and 8.8.8., the client receives incorrect IP addresses. These incorrect addresses are a direct result of the MikroTik DHCP server interpreting the ASCII representation of the IP address string as octets of an IP address.Code:Select allAbove you see that if the value is '192.168.1.105,8.8.8.8', the "raw value" seen in MikroTik is 3139322e3136382e312e3130352c382e382e382e38. The client then receives the following incorrect DNS server addresses:nameserver[0] : 49.57.50.46nameserver[1] : 49.54.56.46nameserver[2] : 49.46.49.48nameserver[3] : 53.44.56.46nameserver[4] : 56.46.56.46which areseeminglyrandom IPs in South Korea, until I started looking closer:49.57.50.46 (49='1', 57='9', 50='2', 46='.')49.54.56.46 (49='1', 54='6', 56='8', 46='.')And so on...

It works as designed. The apostrophe syntax can handle a single IP address but not a list, however, you can concatenate elementary items. So the correct "spelling" looks like this:/ip dhcp-server option add code=6 name=AlternateDNS value="'192.168.1.105''8.8.8.8'"

Just out of curiosity, what makes you manually define Option 6 rather than just setting the DNS server list on the/ip dhcp-server networkrow?
