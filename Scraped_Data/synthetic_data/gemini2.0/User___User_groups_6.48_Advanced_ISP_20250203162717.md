Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive guide on user and user group management on a MikroTik RouterOS device, targeting version 6.48 (with considerations for 7.x) within an ISP environment. We'll specifically focus on the 159.205.69.0/24 subnet on interface `ether-7`.

## Scenario Description:

We are an ISP managing a portion of our customer base connected to a network segment via `ether-7` with a subnet of `159.205.69.0/24`. We need to implement user management with different levels of access. Specifically, we'll create a regular user with limited read-only access, and an admin user with full control. This will include setting up the appropriate user groups and testing their access levels.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to implement user and group management on our MikroTik router.

### Step 1: Initial Check and User List

**Action:** Before making any changes, we'll check the current user list and any existing groups.

**Why?** This provides a baseline to understand the initial state of the router and avoid accidental modifications to existing configurations.

**CLI Command (Before):**
```mikrotik
/user print
/user group print
```

**Example CLI Output (Before):**

```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user print
 #   NAME   GROUP          DISABLED LAST-LOGGED-IN              
 0 admin  full   no       never                        
[admin@MikroTik] > /user group print
 #   NAME    POLICY                                                                                  
 0 full      read,write,test,password,web,api,ftp,reboot,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console,raw,sniffer,
                                                        dude
 1 read      read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console
```

**Explanation:**
The output shows the existing 'admin' user in the `full` group, and a pre-existing 'read' group.

### Step 2: Create a New Read-Only User Group

**Action:** We will create a new group called 'readonly' with limited permissions

**Why?** Groups are used to assign permissions to multiple users at once. The `read` permission provides the ability to view the router's configuration but not change it.

**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user group add name=readonly policy=read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console comment="Read-only users"
```

**Winbox GUI:** Navigate to System -> Users -> Group. Click the '+' button and fill in the details (Name, Policy, and Comment).

**Example CLI Output (After):**
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user group print
 #   NAME       POLICY                                                                                 
 0 full         read,write,test,password,web,api,ftp,reboot,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console,raw,sniffer,
                                                        dude
 1 read         read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console
 2 readonly     read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console   
```

**Explanation:** The new 'readonly' group has been added with limited `read` access.

### Step 3: Create a Regular User

**Action:** We will create a user, "customer1," and assign it to the newly created "readonly" group.

**Why?**  This demonstrates how to create a basic user with restricted access for customer support or monitoring purposes.

**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user add name=customer1 group=readonly password=customer1pass comment="Read-only access for customer 1"
```

**Winbox GUI:** Navigate to System -> Users. Click the '+' button and fill in the details (Name, Group, Password, and Comment).

**Example CLI Output (After):**
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user print
 #   NAME      GROUP    DISABLED LAST-LOGGED-IN              
 0 admin     full    no       never                        
 1 customer1 readonly no        never  
```

**Explanation:** The `customer1` user is created in the `readonly` group.

### Step 4: Create an Admin User

**Action:** We will create an admin user, "ispadmin," and assign it to the `full` group.

**Why?**  This demonstrates a user with full administrative permissions.

**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user add name=ispadmin group=full password=ispadminpass comment="Full admin access"
```

**Winbox GUI:** Navigate to System -> Users. Click the '+' button and fill in the details (Name, Group, Password, and Comment).

**Example CLI Output (After):**
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /user print
 #   NAME      GROUP    DISABLED LAST-LOGGED-IN              
 0 admin     full     no       never                        
 1 customer1 readonly no       never
 2 ispadmin full    no        never
```

**Explanation:** The `ispadmin` user is created in the `full` group with full access.

### Step 5: Verify User Permissions

**Action:** We will attempt to log in with `customer1` via SSH to confirm the user has read-only access by attempting to modify the `/ip address` configuration. Then we'll try the same login with `ispadmin`, which should have write permissions.

**Why?** To ensure the created groups and users have the expected access levels.
    
**CLI Command (Attempting to add IP address as customer1, should fail.):**
```
[customer1@MikroTik] > /ip address add address=10.0.0.1/24 interface=ether1
   failure: not enough rights
```
**Explanation:** As expected, `customer1` cannot modify configurations because the "readonly" user group does not have write rights.

**CLI Command (Attempting to add IP address as ispadmin, should succeed.):**
```
[ispadmin@MikroTik] > /ip address add address=10.0.0.2/24 interface=ether1
[ispadmin@MikroTik] > /ip address print
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic 
 #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE     
 0   10.0.0.2/24    10.0.0.0          ether1          
```
**Explanation:** The `ispadmin` user is able to execute the command, proving the correct access level was granted

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
# Create the read-only user group
/user group add name=readonly policy=read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console comment="Read-only users"

# Create the regular user with read-only access
/user add name=customer1 group=readonly password=customer1pass comment="Read-only access for customer 1"

# Create the admin user with full access
/user add name=ispadmin group=full password=ispadminpass comment="Full admin access"
```

|               | `group`      | User group to which the user belongs.                                 | `readonly`               |
|               | `password`   | Password for the user.                                             | `customer1pass`        |
|               | `comment`    | User defined comment for the user                                    | `Read-only access for customer 1`    |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Forgotten Passwords:** Use strong passwords and have a password reset process, or the recovery method is to default the router and reconfigure.
*   **Incorrect Group Permissions:** Double-check your group policies using `/user group print`. Ensure that the assigned users have the required permissions for the tasks they need to perform. If you suspect a permission error, first check the configured policy, and ensure that the correct group is assigned to the user.
*   **User Lockouts:** If a user fails authentication multiple times, they might be temporarily locked out. Check the login attempts and unlock using Winbox or the CLI. See documentation for `/user print` and `/user unlock`.
*   **Overly Permissive Groups:** Avoid assigning excessive permissions (like `write` or `reboot`) if not necessary.
*   **Security Issues:** Use strong passwords and avoid common names for users. Review the MikroTik manual on user management and hardening.
*   **Resource Issues**: The number of active users will require router CPU and RAM resources. Monitor the router resources, and re-evaluate the router platform if required.
*   **User group not working properly:** If a newly created user does not have the rights of the group, make sure that the user is assigned to the proper group using `/user print`. Also, it may help to close and reopen a terminal to ensure that the changes are applied.
*  **Permissions not working:** If some policies do not work, be sure to have the correct permission for all required components. A policy like `winbox` require the `local` policy, to allow for basic access. Always be sure to test each policy and user before moving forward with a real world implementation.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Login via SSH/Winbox:** Attempt to log in with each user using both SSH and Winbox.
2.  **Test Permissions:**  After login, try commands that require different permission levels. For example, try modifying `/ip address` with `customer1` (should fail), and `ispadmin` (should succeed).
3.  **Review Logs:**  Check `/log print` for login/logout activity and failed login attempts.
4.  **Verify Group Policy:** Ensure group policies are set as expected with `/user group print`.
5.  **Use `torch`**:  Check active user connections with the `torch` utility while logging in to ensure the traffic is present and the correct protocols and IP addresses are used.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **RADIUS Authentication:** For a more scalable user management system, integrate with a RADIUS server.
*   **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory to use existing domain users for authentication.
*   **User Profiles:** Use User profiles to provide specific settings for connected users (like bandwidth limits).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Enforce limits on the users bandwidth based on groups or user.
*   **Hotspot:** Implement Hotspot user management using MikroTik’s built-in hotspot server.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

**Note:** RouterOS versions 7 and later have a REST API.  RouterOS 6 does not have a REST API. The following examples are for RouterOS 7.x.

**Create a User:**

**API Endpoint:** `/user`
**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "name": "apiuser",
  "group": "read",
  "password": "apiuserpass",
  "comment": "API Created User"
}
```

**Example Response (Success - Status code 201):**

```json
{
  "id": "*1",
   "name": "apiuser",
   "group": "read",
   "disabled": false,
    "last-logged-in": ""
}
```

**Example Response (Failure - Status code 400):**

```json
{
  "message": "invalid value for argument 'name'",
  "details": "name cannot be empty"
}
```
**Description:**

*   `id`: The ID of the user which was created.
*   `name`: The username for the user
*   `group`: The user group assigned to the user
*   `disabled`: Whether or not the user account is disabled
*   `last-logged-in`: The last time the user connected to the router.

**Create User Group:**

**API Endpoint:** `/user/group`
**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "name": "apigroup",
  "policy": "read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console",
  "comment": "API Created Group"
}
```

**Example Response (Success - Status code 201):**
```json
{
    "id": "*2",
    "name": "apigroup",
    "policy": "read,local,telnet,ssh,winbox,console"
}
```
**Description:**
*   `id`: The ID of the group which was created.
*   `name`: The name of the new user group.
*   `policy`: The policy for the newly created group.

**Read Users:**

**API Endpoint:** `/user`
**Request Method:** GET
**Example Response:**
```json
[
 {
    "id": "*1",
    "name": "admin",
    "group": "full",
    "disabled": false,
    "last-logged-in": "2024-05-12T14:09:12+00:00"
 },
    {
        "id": "*2",
        "name": "apiuser",
        "group": "read",
        "disabled": false,
        "last-logged-in": ""
    }
]
```
**Description:**
*   `id`: The ID of the user.
*   `name`: The username for the user
*   `group`: The user group assigned to the user
*   `disabled`: Whether or not the user account is disabled
*   `last-logged-in`: The last time the user connected to the router.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all users. Consider using a password generator.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each user.
*   **Disable Default User:** If possible, disable the default 'admin' user and create a new administrative user with a different name.
*   **Regular Password Audits:** Regularly review and update user passwords.
*   **Lockout Policies:** Set up a login lockout policy to mitigate brute-force attacks.
*   **Secure Access:** Use SSH for remote CLI access instead of Telnet. Enable HTTPS for Winbox.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:**  Apply security patches by upgrading to the latest stable RouterOS version.
*  **Filter Ports:** Filter ports from untrusted locations using the firewall. This will limit the possibility of a successful login from untrusted sources.
*  **Disable Unused Services:** Disable services that are not in use, like API, Webfig, and FTP.
*  **Secure API:** Restrict the API access to specific IP addresses when possible, and avoid exposing the API to untrusted networks.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **More Granular Groups:** We could create more specific groups with different policy combinations for better access control. For example, a "support" group with read/test/winbox.
*   **RADIUS Integration:** Using a RADIUS server would greatly improve scalability for user management.
*   **Automation:**  The creation of user accounts and user groups can be automated using scripts, APIs, or configuration management tools.
*  **Password Policies**:  Implement a password policy to ensure users create secure passwords.
*  **Monitoring System**:  Implement a monitoring system that will alert on suspicious activities such as brute force login attempts or unusual access patterns.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic:

MikroTik's user and group management provides a granular way to control access to the router.
*   **Users:** Users represent individuals or services that can connect to and interact with the router. Each user has a username, password, and is assigned to a specific user group.
*   **Groups:** Groups are used to bundle common permissions together. Instead of assigning policies to each user, you create groups with specific sets of permissions, and then add users to the appropriate groups.
*   **Policies:** Policies define what a user or a user group can do on the router. Common policies include `read` (view configuration), `write` (modify configuration), `test` (testing tools), `password` (change password), `web` (web access), `api` (API access), `local`, `telnet`, `ssh`, `winbox`, `console`, `raw`, `sniffer`, `reboot`, and `dude`.
*  **Benefits**: The main benefits of user management is access control to a crucial network device. This allows different people or teams to access the router only as needed, greatly improving security.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Simple vs. Granular Groups:** Having a small number of very broad groups (e.g., read-only vs. full access) simplifies management, but it can lead to users having more access than they need. More granular groups offer better control but are more complicated to manage. A balance must be achieved based on the actual needs of the organization.
*   **Local Users vs RADIUS:** Local users are easy to setup, but they are harder to manage when you have a large number of users. RADIUS is more difficult to setup initially, but much easier to scale and manage.
*   **User Creation/Management Automation vs Manual:** Manual management is good when the number of users are low, but will quickly become a very cumbersome job as the number of users grows. Automation can greatly improve time and accuracy when managing a large user base, but will require technical know-how and skills.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is primarily designed for RouterOS 6.48, while also being compatible with later 7.x versions. There are no significant changes in the commands between these versions, with the exception of the addition of the REST API. When the REST API is used on 7.x, be sure to use the correct endpoints and JSON payload. Be sure to always check the official documentation for specific versions when implementing solutions for a production environment.

I believe this detailed explanation should provide a clear understanding of user and user group management within a MikroTik RouterOS environment, with all the necessary examples, considerations and instructions. Let me know if there are any other areas you would like me to address!
