Okay, let's dive deep into MikroTik RouterOS with a focus on IP Addressing for a SOHO environment using version 7.12. This is going to be an extensive document.

# MikroTik RouterOS: IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6) - SOHO Configuration

This document outlines the configuration of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on a MikroTik router in a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environment. We'll cover essential concepts, implementation steps, security considerations, and diagnostic tools.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Requirements

**Scenario:**
We'll configure a MikroTik router as the primary gateway for a small network.  The router will obtain a public IPv4 address via DHCP from the ISP (Internet Service Provider) and will also be configured for IPv6 using a static prefix delegation from the ISP.  It will provide private IPv4 addresses to the local network via DHCP server, and it will provide the local network with IPv6 addresses via Router Advertisement.
- The local network will be behind the MikroTik router, using NAT for IPv4 and with direct routing for IPv6.
- We need to configure a basic firewall to protect the internal network from the internet.
- The local network will use `192.168.88.0/24` for IPv4 and `2001:db8::/48` for IPv6.
- The router's local interface will have a static IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.
- We'll demonstrate a couple of key features available through the REST API and check basic router information.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

- RouterOS 7.12 installed (or a version in the 7.x or 6.x series).
- The router has at least one WAN interface (connected to the internet) and one LAN interface.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

We'll focus on CLI implementation but will note where settings are easily accessed via Winbox.

### Step 1: Interface Configuration

*   **Identify interfaces:** Let's assume `ether1` is the WAN interface and `ether2` is the LAN interface. You can verify this in `Interface` menu of Winbox or with the CLI `/interface print`.
*  **Disable default configuration (Optional):** If your device has a factory default configuration, you might want to clear it first using `/system reset-configuration`. This ensures a clean state.
    *   This is optional and not necessarily needed, but might be useful in case of legacy configurations.
*   **Enable interfaces:** `/interface enable ether1` and `/interface enable ether2`.

### Step 2: IPv4 Address Configuration

*   **Configure WAN interface for DHCP:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-client add interface=ether1 disabled=no
    ```

*   **Configure static IP address for the LAN interface:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=ether2
    ```

*   **Configure a DHCP server for the LAN:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool add name=dhcp_pool ranges=192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254
    /ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp_lan interface=ether2 address-pool=dhcp_pool lease-time=1d
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 gateway=192.168.88.1 dns-server=192.168.88.1
    ```

### Step 3: IPv6 Address Configuration

*   **Configure WAN interface for DHCPv6:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 dhcp-client add interface=ether1 request=prefix use-peer-dns=no add-default-route=no pool-name=ipv6_pool
    ```

*   **Configure static IPv6 address for the LAN interface:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=ether2 eui-64=no
    ```

*  **Configure router advertisements for the LAN:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 nd add interface=ether2 advertise-dns=no managed-address-flag=no other-config-flag=no
    ```

*   **Note:** Adjust prefix length and other settings based on your ISP's IPv6 delegation. The `eui-64=no`  avoids using  EUI-64 address which is not used for this scenario.

### Step 4: IP Routing

*   **Default route for IPv4 should be added automatically by DHCP client. If not:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=YOUR_GATEWAY_IPV4
    ```
    * Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_IPV4` with your specific gateway IP

*   **Default route for IPv6 should be added automatically by DHCP client. If not:**
     ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 route add dst-address=::/0 gateway=YOUR_GATEWAY_IPV6
    ```
    * Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_IPV6` with your specific gateway IP

### Step 5: Firewall Configuration

*   **Basic NAT for IPv4:**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
    ```

*   **Allow traffic forwarding from LAN to WAN (Forward Chain):**

    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=ether2 out-interface=ether1
    /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related
    /ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop
    ```

*   **Basic IPv6 Firewall (inbound traffic blocking):**

    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input action=accept protocol=icmpv6
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input action=accept connection-state=established,related
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=input action=drop
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=ether2 out-interface=ether1
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related
    /ipv6 firewall filter add chain=forward action=drop
    ```
    *   This firewall allows ICMPv6 which is needed for IPv6 functionality.

### Step 6: Basic Security

*  **Change default admin password:** `/user set admin password=NEW_PASSWORD`
*  **Disable default services:** `/ip service disable www api api-ssl telnet ssh` and enable specific ones when necessary.
*  **Limit access to Winbox by IP:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip service set winbox address=192.168.88.0/24,YOUR_IP
    ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_IP` with your specific management IP.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

*   **DHCP Client Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** The router doesn't get an IP address from the ISP.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check cable connections, ensure DHCP is enabled on the ISP side, verify the interface is correctly set, check logs (`/system logging print`), and use `/ip dhcp-client print detail`.

*   **IPv6 Issues:**
     *  **Problem:** Router does not get prefix from ISP
     *  **Troubleshooting:** Check the client configuration. Check if the ISP router allows for prefix delegation. Verify the interface is correctly set, check logs (`/system logging print`), and use `/ipv6 dhcp-client print detail`.

*   **Firewall Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Problem:** No internet access, internal traffic blocked.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check firewall rules using `/ip firewall filter print` and `/ipv6 firewall filter print`. Verify the order of rules and that the `masquerade` rule is correctly configured. Use `/tool torch interface=ether1` to examine packet flow.

*   **Incorrect Default Route:**
    *   **Problem:** No internet access.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check route table using `/ip route print` and `/ipv6 route print`. Verify default gateway is correct.

*   **DNS Issues:**
     *   **Problem:** Internet works but domain names do not.
     *   **Troubleshooting:** Check the DNS servers provided by DHCP, check the DNS settings of the devices.

*  **Hardware Issues**
    *  **Problem:** Interfaces showing as disconnected.
    *  **Troubleshooting:** Verify the cable, the device connectivity and power. Check that the LEDs on the device shows proper activity.

*  **Software Issues**
    *  **Problem:** Misbehaving services.
    *  **Troubleshooting:** Check the device logs (`/system logging`) and use the `/system resource` to monitor performance. Update the RouterOS version to the latest stable version if needed.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

*   **Ping Test:** From the MikroTik router itself:
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 8.8.8.8
    /ping google.com
    /ipv6 ping 2001:4860:4860::8888
    /ipv6 ping google.com
    ```

*   **Traceroute Test:** From the MikroTik router itself:
    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 8.8.8.8
    /tool traceroute google.com
    /ipv6 tool traceroute 2001:4860:4860::8888
    /ipv6 tool traceroute google.com
    ```

*   **Torch:**  Monitor interface traffic:
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether1
    /tool torch interface=ether2
    ```
    *  The torch tool helps understanding the current traffic of an interface, and it is a very important tool to understand current activity and performance.

*   **IP Scan:** Discover devices on the LAN:
    ```mikrotik
    /tool ip-scan interface=ether2
    ```

*   **Network connectivity test from a LAN device:** Verify if a device on the LAN is getting an IP address and can ping external servers.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

You must enable API support through `/ip service set api enabled=yes` or `/ip service set api-ssl enabled=yes`. Be sure to have proper authentication configuration.

**Important Note:**

*   The default API port for HTTP (API) is `8080`, and for HTTPS (API-SSL) is `8729`.
*  Remember to enable api service to be able to use the REST API. You can choose to enable either `api` or `api-ssl` or both.

We will assume authentication is correctly set.  We'll use `curl` for these examples, but you could use a REST client like Postman or Insomnia. The examples are for a HTTPS enabled API, using the IP address of the router.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik's bridging allows you to combine interfaces into a single logical network segment, functioning like a layer-2 switch. You would typically bridge interfaces to connect multiple Ethernet interfaces to a single logical network.
*   **Routing:**  The routing functionality in RouterOS determines the best path to forward data between networks. MikroTik supports both static and dynamic routing protocols.
*  **Firewall:** The MikroTik firewall is a stateful firewall that is able to filter packets based on multiple criteria (ports, protocols, source, destination, L7 matching), and do source and destination NAT. The firewall provides security by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** NAT allows you to share a single public IP address among multiple devices on a private network. In a standard SOHO environment, the router will use NAT to allow devices on the private LAN to access the Internet.
*   **DHCP:** DHCP provides automatic IP address assignment to devices within the network. This is essential for ease of use and management.
*   **IPv6:** The new generation IP protocol provides better address allocation and management, solving the IP address exhaustion from IPv4.
* **DHCPv6**: DHCPv6 is the equivalent of DHCP for IPv6, it is used by devices to automatically configure the IPv6 parameters.
* **Router Advertisements**: Router Advertisements is the IPv6 mechanism for allowing the devices to auto configure their IPv6 addresses.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Change the Default Password:** This is the first and most crucial step.
*   **Limit Service Access:** Restrict access to management interfaces (Winbox, SSH) to trusted IP addresses.
*   **Disable Unused Services:**  Disable any service you do not require.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Ensure your RouterOS is up to date to receive security patches.
*   **Implement Firewall Rules:** Use firewalls to restrict inbound traffic.
*   **Use Strong Authentication:** For any remote access protocols (SSH, VPN), use strong passwords and consider using key-based authentication.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Keep an eye on router logs for suspicious activities.
*   **Avoid Default Configurations:** Do not use default configurations, as this can make the router more vulnerable to exploits.
*  **HTTPS for Management:** Always use HTTPS when accessing the API. Do not use HTTP api.
* **Disable default user or enable passwords:** Disable default `admin` user if not needed, or set a very complex password.
* **Use secure passwords:** Always use a secure password that cannot be easily guessed.
* **Review Firewall regularly:** Always verify the firewall rules are correct.
