The only way to do this, is to uninstall the qqireless package and install the wifi-qcom-ac package on the cAP ac.More info can be found here:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... edexamplesAnd here:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... 2/PackagesBasically (on the cAP ac):Uninstall wireless packageRebootInstall wifi-qcom-acAter installation, both devices are now available to be managed by the latest CAPsMAN version.There is a YouTube video about that:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHotZT41w3E&t=89sBut also you can use the documentation for that:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ionexample:
