HiThe first one, to update the packages, is working normally, but I would like to record each step in the log, but when it goes to update it apparently executes both commands at the same time, causing the log record to be on "wait", However, as when it finishes updating it restarts, it ends up not printing the information I want in the log.Code:Select allThe second script, which would be to update the Routerboard, does not restart it. If I run the script through the terminal, it waits for confirmation. Would I be able to make the script respond to confirmation or make it restart without confirmation?Code:Select allI didn't find anything in the docs, can you guys help me?
