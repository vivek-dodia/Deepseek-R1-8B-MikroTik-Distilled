Dear Community,I'm bumping into an issue where I'm running dry in options to solve and turns to the community for options to progress.On a site to site config, I can access all resources, except one web interface from one specific host.Enclosed is the network diagram:- 2 sites (A and B) inter-connected via wireguard and one rogue warrior which connects via wireguard- site A (ie device A1) and roguewarrior (C1) can access site B (for example can ping and ssh devices B1 and B2). [conclusion: the wireguard tunnels operate as intended, and the routers on sites A and B do NAT properly]- when A1 or C1 are connecting to hosts on site B, the traffic is natted and the host see the connection from the router B0 internal interface (eg: when ssh from A1 to B2, host B2 see connection from it's local router B0 address 192.168.34.254)- BUT B1 has a web interface (port 80) and only B1 fails to properly access it: when connecting on http from A1 to B1, the connection establish but page-load times out when fetching the multiple .css and .js files (it manages to only fetch a single .js)- however that same web interface of B1 can be accessed without any issue from C1 rogue warrior [conclusion: this would lead me to believe that the config on site B is OK, and the issue would be on the router of site A]- B2 has also a web interface (port 80), also with css and javascript, and can be seamlessly accessed by both A1 and C1. [conclusion: other http resources from site B can be accessed, which isolates the issue on accessing the web interface of B1]- I tried to swap devices A1 and C1, and I get the same result: when A1 connects as rogue warrior (ie: where C1 is connected), it can load the B1 web interface without issue; and when C1 connects to the LAN on site A (ie: where A1 is connected) it no longer can load the B1 web interface- tests are run with cache disabled/purgedThis lead me to believe that the setup on site B works properly, and the issue is on the router A0 from site A- to troubleshoot, I created a firewall rule on top of the forward chain to allow any to any, but I still have the same behavior on loading the content of the web interface - code:Code:Select alladdaction=accept chain=forward comment="DEBUG - enable fwd to ALL (eg: any to any)"- for routes on A0: route is made for 192.168.34.0/24 and 192.168.42.16/28 via wireguard site-to-site interface (which has address on A0 192.168.42.17) and successfully transit traffic inter sites (ping, ssh)That A0 router is a Mikrotik router (tile), running routerOS v7.17Any suggestion on where to investigate further?Network diagram:2025-01-29 network diagram.pngWeb console output:2025-01-29 web console.png

Bumping this - no ideas on where to progress?

You have not provided the configs of both routers./export file=anynamewyouwish   ( minus router serial number, any publicWANIP information, keys etc. )

Thanks anav,I'm not inclined to dump whole configs there:- large risk of side tracking- the other router isn't a mikrotik- confidentialitypointers on where I haven't looked would be useful.I can't understand why I can access all services of that host (telnet, ssh, ftp), except http if not roguewarrior

Which one is the MT and is it the Server peer for handshake or client poeer?Understand about other router but if you cant post on the MT, I will move on.

agreed, it's a fair ask.I think I called which router is Mikrotik in the initial post:That A0 router is a Mikrotik router (tile), running routerOS v7.17But I haven't called how the Wireguard config works - fair precision:- router A0 is responder- router B0 is initiatorAnd naturally, that would prompt the question on "are we sure the tunnel is still established when requesting data from site A to B"?Yes:- this tunnel is set with keepalive (30 secs) on both sides.- And for the sake of testing, I keep a ping running in the background from site A to the target device on site B.- An ftp transfer from Site A to that device on site B can also work successfully - while simultaneously the http site fails to load completely.I don't have specific rule/s in the firewall to prevent traffic to port 80 (http).

To complement, the previous response:- I given the slow response (and errors) to fetch http .js files, I looked into queues, but I only use simple queues for outbound traffic nothing is reported dropped. For sake of testing, I disabled all queues and got the same outcome- on the site B side, it's not because the http server is overloaded - there's only max 1 or 2 concurrent client- these outcome reported are with Firefox. I tested with edge. And it managed to download all .js files (but it took 15 minutes to transfer 163kB). Seems firefox gives up earlier than edge.
