Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive MikroTik RouterOS configuration for your specified scenario, focusing on the target subnet and interface, and expanding to cover the breadth of your request. This will be an expert-level walkthrough.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**

We are building a part of an ISP network where a subnet `184.86.44.0/24` is being assigned to clients connected to a bridge interface named `bridge-23`. This scenario includes configuring IP addressing, DHCP, routing, security, QoS, and other essential aspects of an ISP-level setup. We will be focusing on providing internet connectivity through this subnet, alongside related features.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (This example will be generally compatible with 6.48 and other 7.x versions, but specific features will be noted where there are differences).
*   **Device Type:** Capable of bridging, routing, and firewalling. A router with sufficient processing power is assumed.
*   **Interface:** An existing bridge interface named `bridge-23`. If it doesn't exist we will create it.
*   **IPv4 Addressing:** Static IPv4 address on the bridge interface from the given subnet.
*   **IPv6 Addressing:** Basic IPv6 setup for future growth.
*   **DHCP Server:** DHCPv4 server for allocating IPs from the subnet to clients connected to `bridge-23`.
*   **Routing:** Basic routing for internet access, assuming a default gateway exists.
*   **Firewall:** Basic security rules for protection against unauthorized access, port forwarding, and NAT.
*   **QoS:** Basic QoS to prioritize certain traffic.
*   **Security:** Basic security best practices.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)

Here's how we'll set up the router using both CLI commands and a brief mention of the Winbox GUI where useful:

### Step 1: Create Bridge Interface (if it doesn't exist)
**CLI**
```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-23
/interface bridge port
# Assuming ether2 and ether3 need to be on bridge-23
add bridge=bridge-23 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge-23 interface=ether3
```

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `Bridge` > `Bridges`.
*   Click `+`, create a bridge named `bridge-23`, add interfaces under `Bridge Ports`.

### Step 2: Configure IPv4 Address

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=184.86.44.1/24 interface=bridge-23
```

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `IP` > `Addresses`.
*   Click `+`, enter the IP address and subnet `/24` and choose `bridge-23`.

### Step 3: Configure IPv6 Address

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ipv6 address
add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=bridge-23
```

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `IPv6` > `Addresses`.
*   Click `+`, enter the IPv6 address and subnet `/64` and choose `bridge-23`.

### Step 4: Configure DHCP Server

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=dhcp_pool_23 ranges=184.86.44.10-184.86.44.254

/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=dhcp_pool_23 interface=bridge-23 name=dhcp-srv-23

/ip dhcp-server network
add address=184.86.44.0/24 gateway=184.86.44.1 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `IP` > `Pool` and create a new pool.
*   Go to `IP` > `DHCP Server`, create a server, and choose `bridge-23`, and link the new pool.
*   Go to `IP` > `DHCP Server` > `Networks` and add the network with appropriate gateway and DNS servers.

### Step 5: Configure Basic Routing (Default Gateway)

**CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip route
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.1.1
```
**Note**: Replace 192.168.1.1 with your actual upstream gateway.

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `IP` > `Routes`.
*   Click `+`, add a default route `0.0.0.0/0` and the `Gateway`.

### Step 6: Configure Basic Firewall

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
# Accept established and related connections
add action=accept chain=input connection-state=established,related
add action=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related

# Allow specific input ports (Example: Winbox, SSH)
add action=accept chain=input dst-port=8291,22 protocol=tcp

# Allow ICMP (Ping)
add action=accept chain=input protocol=icmp

# Drop all other input
add action=drop chain=input

# Basic NAT (Masquerade)
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat out-interface=<WAN interface>
```

**Note**: Replace `<WAN interface>` with the appropriate internet-facing interface name (e.g., `ether1` or `pppoe-out1`).

**Winbox:**

*   Go to `IP` > `Firewall`. Configure rules as in the CLI example, under `Filter Rules` and `NAT`.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

### Pitfalls

*   **Incorrect Interface Names:** Double-check that the interface names in your config (e.g., `bridge-23`, `<WAN interface>`) exactly match your router's interfaces.
*   **Firewall Rules Order:** Incorrect firewall rule order can lead to dropped packets. Rules are processed in order.
*   **Incorrect NAT:** If NAT is configured for the wrong interface or with incorrect parameters, clients won't reach the internet.
*   **DHCP Issues:** Overlapping DHCP pools or incorrect network settings can cause address allocation problems.
*   **MTU Issues:** MTU mismatches with the connected devices or ISP
*   **CPU Overload:** Router overload could be the result of a poorly configured firewall or NAT rule.
*   **Software Bugs:** Check for RouterOS updates to fix software bugs.
*   **Hardware Issues:** Failing components can lead to unexpected behaviour.

### Troubleshooting and Diagnostics

*   **Ping:** Use `/ping <target IP>` to check network reachability.
    *   Example: `ping 8.8.8.8`
*   **Traceroute:** Use `/traceroute <target IP>` to trace the path to a destination.
    *   Example: `traceroute 8.8.8.8`
*   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=<interface>` to analyze traffic flowing through an interface in real-time. Useful for checking if packets are reaching their destination and analysing the types of traffic.
    * Example: `/tool torch interface=bridge-23`
*   **Packet Sniffer:** Use `/tool packet-sniffer` to capture and analyse network traffic.
    *  Example: `tool packet-sniffer start file-name=packet_capture interface=bridge-23`
*   **Log:** Use `/system logging print` to check system logs for error messages.
*   **Interface Stats:** Use `/interface monitor-traffic <interface>` to check if the interface is working
    * Example: `/interface monitor-traffic bridge-23`
* **CPU Monitoring**: Check CPU resources `/system resource monitor`
*   **Error Scenario Example:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients on `bridge-23` can't access the internet.
    *   **Check:** Use `/ping 8.8.8.8` from the router. If it fails, check the default route. If successful, double check the NAT rules. If that does not solve the issue use `torch` to monitor the traffic on bridge-23, to determine if there's any traffic.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

*   **IP Address on Interface:** Check if the configured address is assigned to `bridge-23` using `/ip address print`.
*   **DHCP Lease:** On a connected client, verify the client receives an IP from the configured range and check the IP address of the client using `ipconfig` on a windows machine.
*   **Internet Access:** From a client connected to `bridge-23`, try to ping `8.8.8.8` and access a website using a browser.
*   **Routing Table:** Use `/ip route print` to verify that the default route is in place.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Make sure the firewall allows necessary traffic, using the provided commands.
*   **NAT Rules:** Make sure the NAT is correctly configured by attempting to navigate to an external site from a host connected to bridge-23.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Bridging & Switching:** MikroTik bridges operate at layer 2, combining multiple interfaces as if they are a single segment. This is more flexible than a VLAN setup, but less scalable.
*   **VLANs:** VLANs allow you to logically separate network traffic on a single interface. This is useful for adding additional services to the interface or to segment traffic of several customers.
*   **MACVLAN:** Allows you to create multiple virtual interfaces with unique MAC addresses from a single physical interface, but they are still on the same layer 2 segment. Good for situations when multiple MACs are needed on the same physical medium.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:** Some MikroTik devices offload routing to the switch chip for faster performance.
*   **MACsec:** (IEEE 802.1AE) - provides layer 2 security by encryption and authentication, useful in a point-to-point link
*   **Quality of Service (QoS):** Enables prioritization of traffic. It is essential for an ISP network in order to ensure that a specific client does not interfere with the bandwidth of another client.
*   **Switch Chip Features:** MikroTik's integrated switches enable features like VLAN filtering.
*   **VXLAN:** Used for extending layer 2 networks over layer 3.
*   **Connection Tracking:** The firewall tracks connections, making it easier to manage stateful traffic.
*   **Packet Flow:** Ingress, bridging, routing, firewall, NAT and egress.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

**Note:** The RouterOS API must be enabled (`/ip service print`) and accessible.

**Example 1: Get IP Address List**

*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<router_ip>:8729/rest/ip/address`
*   **Method:** GET
*   **Request:** (None)
*   **Expected Response:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "*0",
        "address": "184.86.44.1/24",
        "interface": "bridge-23",
        "network": "184.86.44.0",
        "actual-interface": "bridge-23"
      }
    ]
    ```

**Example 2: Add IP Address**

*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<router_ip>:8729/rest/ip/address`
*   **Method:** POST
*   **Request Payload (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "address": "184.86.44.2/24",
        "interface": "bridge-23"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response:**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "added",
        "id": "*1"
    }
    ```
**Example 3: Get DHCP leases**
*   **API Endpoint:** `https://<router_ip>:8729/rest/ip/dhcp-server/lease`
*   **Method:** GET
*   **Request:** (None)
*   **Expected Response:**
    ```json
    [
    {
        "id":"*2",
        "address":"184.86.44.10",
        "mac-address":"00:11:22:33:44:55",
        "host-name":"unknown",
        "active-address":"184.86.44.10",
        "active-mac-address":"00:11:22:33:44:55",
        "server":"dhcp-srv-23",
        "status":"bound",
        "last-seen":"3s",
        "dynamic":"true"
    }]
    ```

**Note:** You will need to replace `<router_ip>` with the actual IP address of your MikroTik router. You might also need to enable the API service and ensure you have credentials for access. The `/rest` interface is only available on RouterOS v7 and above, if you are using a lower version you need to use the `/api` interface instead

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik bridges allow multiple interfaces to act as one logical network segment. The bridge doesn't forward at IP layer, but at layer 2, meaning that it forwards Ethernet frames, so that multiple clients will be able to communicate directly on layer 2 with no routing involved.
*   **Routing:** MikroTik routing is based on destination-based routing. When a packet arrives, the router consults its routing table to determine the next hop for that destination network. A specific destination address has higher priority than a broader one.
*   **Firewall:** The MikroTik firewall is a stateful packet filter with the concept of chains, allowing different types of traffic to be handled independently (input traffic, forwarded traffic, output traffic). It has multiple layers of filtering based on the OSI model.
*   **NAT:** Network Address Translation translates one IP address to another. In an ISP scenario, it's used to translate private internal IPs to a public IP to access the internet. Source NAT translates the source IP, Destination NAT the destination IP.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any services you don't need (e.g., API, telnet, unused DHCP).
    *  `/ip service disable telnet`
*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Change Default Ports:** Change default ports for services like Winbox (8291) and SSH (22).
    * `/ip service set winbox port=1234`
*   **Limit Access:** Restrict access to the router's management interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
     *   `/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input src-address=192.168.1.0/24 dst-port=8291,22 protocol=tcp`
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Use HTTPS:** Use secure HTTPS connections for Winbox or API access.
*   **IPSec for Management:** Use an IPSec VPN to access management interfaces instead of public access.
*   **MAC Server:** You can configure a MAC server to allow access based on the MAC address of the administrator.
    *   `/tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=ether1 enabled=yes`
*   **RoMON:** RoMON, if used, should be secured with proper passwords.
*   **Certificates:** Use SSL certificates for secure management, API access, or VPNs.
    *   `/certificate import file-name=mycertificate.pem`
*  **PPP AAA:** Use AAA (authentication, authorization, accounting) for ppp connections.
*  **RADIUS:** Use a RADIUS server to centrally manage authentication and authorization.
*   **User Groups:** Create user groups with appropriate rights to implement a Role-Based Access Control model
    * `/user group add name=admin policy=read,write,test,password,web,ftp,reboot`

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for Additional MikroTik Topics

Due to the vast scope of the additional topics listed, I will provide a brief explanation and configuration example for each, focusing on their integration with our main scenario:

```mikrotik
/interface macvlan add interface=ether2 mac-address=00:11:22:AA:BB:CC name=macvlan1
```
### 10.12 L3 Hardware Offloading
Hardware offloading allows layer 3 routing to be processed on the switch chip rather than on the CPU, for increased efficiency. The feature can be enabled or disabled per interface.
```mikrotik
/interface ethernet set ether2 l3-hw-offloading=yes
```
### 10.13 MACsec
MACsec encryption provides security on layer 2. It is mostly used in a point-to-point connection.
```mikrotik
/interface macsec print
Flags: X - disabled
 #   NAME           PARENT-INTERFACE  ENCRYPTION-POLICY   KEY-MODE      CIPHER-SUITE    TX-SA-ID  RX-SA-ID  PASS-THROUGH-UNSECURED-FRAME
```
### 10.14 Quality of Service

```mikrotik
/queue simple
add max-limit=10M/20M name=queue-download target=184.86.44.0/24
```
### 10.15 Switch Chip Features
Some MikroTik devices include a switch chip which provides hardware layer 2 functionality. VLAN filtering can be set on the bridge.
```mikrotik
/interface bridge set bridge-23 vlan-filtering=yes
```
### 10.16 VLAN
VLANs logically separate network traffic.
```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add interface=bridge-23 name=vlan10 vlan-id=10
```
### 10.17 VXLAN
Used to extend layer 2 traffic over layer 3.
```mikrotik
/interface vxlan add name=vxlan1 vni=100 interface=bridge-23 remote-address=10.10.10.1
```
### 10.18 Firewall and Quality of Service
These configurations have been addressed with examples above
### 10.19 IP Services
DHCP server example was created above, DNS service is also important to allow name resolving.
```mikrotik
/ip dns print
                      servers: 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
      allow-remote-requests: no
    max-concurrent-queries: 100
                 cache-size: 2048KiB
        cache-max-ttl: 1w
```
### 10.20 High Availability Solutions
MikroTik supports bonding, VRRP, Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group (MLAG), and other high-availability features.
*   **Bonding**: Combine multiple interfaces into a single link for redundancy or increased throughput.
```mikrotik
/interface bonding add mode=balance-xor name=bond1 slaves=ether1,ether2
```
*   **VRRP**: Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for failover.
```mikrotik
/interface vrrp add interface=bridge-23 name=vrrp1 vrid=1 priority=200
```
### 10.21 Mobile Networking
