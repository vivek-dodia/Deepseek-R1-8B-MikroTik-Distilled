Hello everyone!I just bought a Mikrotik Ax3 US version, unpacked it, set it up via Quick Set for LAN DHCP internet, and connected all devices via WiFi. When I tried to configure the access list through the web interface, I noticed that the "default authentication" option is no longer available in the interface. I added a "Deny all" rule at the end, and… these rules are simply being ignored. I tried to block a specific MAC address: it still connects. I reset the router and reconfigured everything—still not working. I also tried updating the firmware (was 7.14.3, updated to 7.15.3)—no effect. I noticed that the WiFi interface manager was set to Capsman, so I changed it to local—still not working. It seems like the access list is being ignored, no matter how I try to apply it. What am I doing wrong?Router: Ax3Firmware: 7.15.3 (Packages: routeros 7.15.3, wifi-qcom 7.15.3)Access list:Code:Select allI’m sure something is misconfigured somewhere. I’d appreciate any help in advance.PS: In the process, I accidentally bricked my AC2 (didn’t notice that the laptop reconnected to the old network) where everything was configured and working perfectly (firmware was around 6.49.2).
