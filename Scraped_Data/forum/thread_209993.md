hi normis,it intended for mikrotik training class (espesially mtcna) where we put the dude server on main router (rb4011) but not all of students can open it from their pc / notebook as it's limited to max 5 users on the same time.

Is the training material still on 6.49.x ?I hope so, v7 is still far away from a production-ready replacement.

Please make 6.49.17 Long-Term.And please, create the Long-Term chain on v7 also.This will help to avoid mimimis around "v7 is not production ready".

And please, create the Long-Term chain on v7 also.I had to use PIM in a v7-device, it is so stable as a house of cards.Every few days a "autosupout.rif" is generated, because something crashed internally.The Multi-WAN Wireguard-route-selection was fixed only in last 7.15.3.For easy setups, maybe, v7 is stabel enough. But the moment you use it for cases ROS is designed for. Heaven forbid! Is's years away from a long-term in my eyes... Look here:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... l+Overviewso much red and yellow and you dream of a "long-term" :D

You still forgot my #[SUP-126246]: Winbox IPv6 ND reachable time units.  Cosmetic bug (works correctly and the value is specified in seconds, only Winbox and Webfig show wrong units label "ms" instead of "s"), but introduced in 6.47.10 which itself was a long-term release.Reported exactly one year ago, and the response was: "This has been fixed in RouterOS V7, in RouterOS V6 branches this won't be fixed as V6 updates will only include security fixes." (yeah, so the long-term 6.47.10 showing the wrong units was a security fix?)I plan to stick with v6 for a long time on RB931/RB941-2nD (the cheap basic routers which I give to customers for free with the service, tired of supporting cheap crappy chinese routers), simply because of limited hardware resources.

What's new in 6.49.16  (2024-Jun-07 10:02):(factory only release)Out of sheer curiosity - what device was released to the market with 6.49.16 factory installed?I plan to stick with v6 for a long time on RB931/RB941-2nD (the cheap basic routers which I give to customers for free with the service, tired of supporting cheap crappy chinese routers), simply because of limited hardware resources.I wonder how long v6 is going to get updates, most of my switches are on v6 long-term and I don't really see any reason to update them to v7 unless I have no other option (somewhat old hardware).

I think most of the MIPS hardware gets v6 in factory still - given they are manufactured still.But what makes me wonder more than that:why was it necessary to release 6.49.16  without a single actual change? This maybe only makes sense for the purpose of raising the "factory-software version" property in routerboard. But why was this necessary?

---
### Post 17

Perhaps some of those v6-only hardware got R2 (with some slight HW changes, requiring minor changes in some device driver?) Since such change doesn't apply to already shipped hardware, ROS change can be factory-only (and it doesn't have to be publicly available since new devices can not be downgraded to older ROS to be upgraded to such factory-only version). The only problem is if owner of such R2 device wants to netinstall the device (in which case he'd probably get necessary files from MT support).
