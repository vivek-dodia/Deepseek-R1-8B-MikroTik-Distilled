You don't, CAPsMAN is automatically installed with version 7.13.x and up.It has moved, can be configured on /interface wifi (or the wifi menu item).Here is a link to the official documentation:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... iFiCAPsMANAnd...if you don't use the old CAPsMAN, you could consider removing the wireless package (which is of no use).
