To be clear — IDK why the forum was getting 500 errors / hanging — I more was trying to make a joke.

A spike in session counts is usually a good indicator of a DDoS attack.Yup.I'd like to think it's still possible to self-host a 25 year old "web app" (phpBB here).  i.e. without needing cloud services (AWS, cloudflare, Azure, etc.) or expensive enterprise security products.  Perhaps not — that why I'd be curious about at "root cause" here from Mikrotik, perhaps be a good YouTube video.

But I always block all search bot and never had an issue with max session limit hit. And yes even Google misbehaves at times.It’s extremely rare nowadays for big companies using index bots to misbehave. If there’s a problem, it’s usually a misconfiguration on your end. Also, legal index bots don’t use anonymous access.If you allow anonymous access, spikes in guest session counts are almost always a pretty reliable indicator of a DDoS attack.EDIT:The guest session counts are currently at 1651, so I’m guessing the botnet driver has ramped up the pace. This is a battle Mikrotik won’t win unless they take some serious action.

Ah. This we agree upon: it's past time they shove it behind some Cloudfare or whatnot.+1Not be the contritaian.  Why should some cloud solution be needed?I'm pretty sure Mikrotik can fix this without 3rd parties.  Maybe not.  But Mikrotik's basic product pitch is nothing depends on the cloud.And I've seen a recent trends to promotingself-hosting to avoid cloud costs, so the forum kinda curious test of that theory.i.e.to host a server for a few thousand users on BGP connected AS, without needing cloudflare.

---
### Post 47

Not be the contritaian.  Why should some cloud solution be needed?Because this is not their core business. Their routers aren't the best bet to fend off heavy DDOSs - and they shouldn't: it isn't their market target. It's akin to asking Amazon why they are hiring heavy haulers to do the inventory transport. It isn't their core business.

Their routers aren't the best bet to fend off heavy DDOSs - and they shouldn't: it isn't their market target.IDK, maybe it should be.  I just don't buy that every publicly visible site needs to use hosted cloud services.  If a company that makes high performance routers cannot secure a simple ~LAMP app... that would be telling.Personally, I'd like to see the forum run as containers on Mikrotik hardware (or, maybe Ampere).  Microsoft always used to drag out MS's IT department when pitching new services to their customers, with their lessons learned.  So if Mikrotik had to run production containers using their own features, maybe /container get more fixes.

If you need serious DDoS protection as a front-end service, it takes massive computing resources, expert skills, and experience.Normally, IMO that’s not something a company like MT could manage on-premise by themselves.

I guess I'm saying Mikrotik runs VPN proxy (BTH) and /ip/cloud DDNS already.  So some PHP should actually be easier than BTH to secure.....and why I present the question.As a data point, I ran a ping over the weekend, it was ~250ms from the west coast to Mikrotik/Lativia, with 1.5% packet loss – which is similar to what I've seen in past.Code:Select all--- forum.mikrotik.com ping statistics ---

IDK, maybe it should be.  I just don't buy that every publicly visible site needs to use hosted cloud services.  If a company that makes high performance routers cannot secure a simple ~LAMP app... that would be telling.It COULD be. But the need of something able to fend off heavy ddos attacks and what Mikrotik sells today... it's several degrees of separation. I mean, I love Mikrotik hardware - but they have their limits, and it's OK: no one can be a jack of all trades.By Mikrotik to route.By something else to mitigate huge ddos.Buy a third vendor to cattle for your HTTP needs.Why should someone be the "do all and be all"? It's elephants all the way down!

Why do you all think that this is/was some sort of attack?Because the number of connected - and anonymous - users just keeps getting up until the forum crashes. Yes, we could be dealing of one (several?) bad written crawlers. But I don't know... more and more it looks to me as some kind of attack.

### Post 55

IDK, maybe it should be.It COULD be.I wasn't trying to argue – not wrong from a pure business perspective hosting might make more sense, especially if uptime and low-latency were a concern....But for Mikrotik it would be a sign of capitulation.  And implication that any small/medium sized business should not self-host things like a public web site.  IDK the right answer, given all threats.  That being said... being dependent on a cloud provider has different risks too.Anyway, I'd be curious on the hearing the root cause from Mikrotik...

No one complains to the Tyre maker when the ring has problems.No one think it's weird when a ring is damaged by bad roads.I think it's the same thing: Mikrotik does routers, not DDOSs mitigation equipment.Try the reverse: how many DDOSs equipment makers are geared through a simple routing algorithm?

We have disabled the search robots, except biggest ones, but the attacks are regular DDoS attacks going to different IP every time. We are trying to optimize the forum servers to handle bigger loads, but the attacks keep getting bigger too. Since PHPBB is old software, another option would be to migrate to other forum software that supports load balancing, high availibility etc. But I also know many forum users would not like it.

That’s it. If everything’s ready, it’ll only take you 5-10 minutes tops.Ps.. Pro tip: forget about reboots and focus on addressing the root cause instead.Or use cloudflare in between WWW and server.Yup, that is the way!No, just a better firewall.Cloudflare is a DDoS firewall!  Cloud-based DDoS protection services are way better than anything you could ever build on-premise.

Now would be a good time to check the logs for user agents.  May come up empty thou since you can use any valid user agents.I’m only gonna say this once: with a proper DDoS firewall that also catches other bad stuff, you don’t have to bother about invalid user agents since they’ll get blocked anyway!Even varnish could help to its extent - if you want to avoid 3rd party cloud services. But one is for sure: you cant beat or optimize anything out of phpbb legacy (other than throwing tons of hardware on it)Yup, that's how it is!Even if MT throw a bunch of new powerfull hardware at it, I’m pretty sure the DDoS operator will just spin up a few more threads. Like I said, DDoS bots are dirt cheap to rent, especially for small-scale attacks like the ones hitting this forum.

Noting that despite a range of dozens potential solutions (AWS, Azure, Cisco, PaloAlto, etc etc etc) to the DoS problem... the community seems align on Cloudflare as solution.  That says something.I've used Cloudflare for the last four years for most of my sites (for free, BTW) and it's been great.  I don't have any properties that get the volume of traffic that MikroTik gets, but I do have a video streaming app I built that peaks at around 1000-2000 users every six months. On the free tier, there are limits on the amount of bandwidth one can use, but I don't think cost is MT's concern as much as control over DNS is.  (As for me, I like not having to run/manage DNS servers anymore.  Did that and email for 15-20 years...)When COVID policies limited who could go to church, I put together a broadcasting solution for a couple dozen of our local congregations. Written in node.js, it uses web sockets to handle playback control and telemetry.  Without Cloudflare, the app control server struggled with the WSS load at around 100 users. With Cloudflare, the WSS hits are smoothed out and the system can handle 1000+ users simultaneously.

Installing Cloudflare's single exe tunnel in a NPK, with some UI/CLI for some of the common services seems like a simpler path to filling in the gap between RouterOS vs getting into being a security product themselves (which is hard, since new threats evolve daily...).

It’s a lucky dip if it’s online when I come on here. Brings a bit of excitement and variation to my day.

At least they had the decency of NOT calling it "Mikrotik 365".

Boats you find on the shores of the UK.You can't get back with that.Atleast the Mikrotik forum floats again.

The various web-scanners from AI companies are getting even more aggressive than before, to the point articles start to be written about it causing four-five digits of extra fees from hosting companies to to the scanned website owners for all the bandwidth used.The stuff seems to be slapped together in the most lazy/basic ways, without any "I've been here already" tracking. (Not to mention ignoring the robots.txt rules asking them to stay away.)One old forum server I host was also hit hard, the webserver handled the load but I've started to get alerts because the (ancient) statistics software was taking so long to parse the hourly accesslog (which was growing to hundreds of MBs) it overlapped into the next hour, triggering a cronjob error.In the log it was basically obvious the crawler in question was digging through /all/ of the forum posts over and over from the beginning, from many IPs in parallel.So yeah, literal definition of a DDoS but not necessarily as a targetted attack. I wouldn't be surprised if something like this is happening here as well.

It's definitely not a crawler, and it seems like the DDoS attacks are getting worse.DDoS 01142025.png

I believe MikroTik could benefit from professional support or consulting regarding the operation and hosting of a web application. There have already been some suggestions in this regard. The forum is experiencing HTTP 500 errors almost daily.2025-01-14_11-22.pngThere is a typo: it should be "later" instead of "latter".

migrate to other forum software that supports load balancing, high availibility etcIm 100% sure one can do this with PHPBB and HAProxyhttps://www.haproxy.org/EDIT:something like this should work like a charm:Code:Select allfrontend WEB
listen :::80 v4v6
listen :::443 v4v6 crt /tmp/crt/ alpn h2,http/1.1
http-request redirect scheme https unless { ssl_fc }

stick-table type ip size 1m expire 10s store http_req_rate(10s)
tcp-request inspect-delay 10s
tcp-request content track-sc0 src
http-request deny if { sc_http_req_rate(0) gt 1 }

A load balancer like haproxy as a single measure wont improve the situation significantly. Worst case it would introduce all kind of other issues other than HTTP 500 we currently see - if done badly.I have no experience with phpbb itself, but from a quick google research it seems to have a redis cache driver. To have a shared cache instance is basically first requirement to balance at all.It is unknown to us to which degree this phpbb instance is optimized at all.Most probably some kind of fine grained rate limiting could already do a good job - without the need for fancy pants SaaS solutions like cloudflare.we dont know what, which kind or how many of requests are taking down the forum after all. We are only speculating. So it is hard to tell where the bottleneck is located.

So it is hard to tell where the bottleneck is located.Was more about normis stating that you can't load balance phpbb.As for files there could also be 2 really dirty solutions:1. Just don't care about it for users not logged in (as they can't see attachments anyway) and only load balance those2. Use a shared volumeAnd yes we don't know what the problem load is other than it seems somewhere between 500 - 5000 phpbb sessionsAs most people on here were saying "use cloudflare" and mikrotik seems to be against it, it could be another solution.(I did include a rate limit in my quick haproxy mockup)As others have stated as well. It leaves a bad feeling about mikrotik cloud services.

How aboutRate Limiting with Nginx? Works well for a customer's Java web application to restrain the crawler bots.

When we do rate limiting, you users will also be limited. All connections come from random IP addresses. When there are thousands of connections coming in at once, either the servers get overloaded, or there is some cloudflare "read only because this is a cached site" page, either way, forum will not be fully operational when this happens.

How aboutRate Limiting with Nginx? Works well for a customer's Java web application to restrain the crawler bots.Well crawlers aren't ddos attacks.My customers run haproxy with a connection limit.Which means once that is reached new connections will join a queue. (Until the users browser times out)Webserver doesn't get overloaded but users do get affected.So it can happen that it's not fully usable for everyone.When we do rate limiting, you users will also be limited. All connections come from random IP addresses. When there are thousands of connections coming in at once, either the servers get overloaded, or there is some cloudflare "read only because this is a cached site" page, either way, forum will not be fully operational when this happens.If you rate limit the affected urls (I think someone was talking about ucp.php before) then it should slow down the attack and barely affect real users.But in the end we all know they will just look for a new url.Maybe shadowban the IP/url combo? So the user will just access a static version of the page (cloudflares cached message)There's many more possibilities but since none of us know the real vector of attack we can just assumeEDIT:Btw another idea would be to just slow down connections that hit the rate limit.And the problem should be getting less common

Every connection is from a unique IP, there is nothing to ban

Assuming that more than one request comes from each unique IP, implementing rate limits can at least help mitigate the issue. It would require someone with a strong dislike for MikroTik and control over an entire ASN to send, for example, 5000 requests using 5000 unique IPs.

And the typical TCP client in that scenario is a zombie in a botnet that has no traceable relationship to the person who orchestrates the attack, so an AS is totally irrelevant here. I can e.g. imagine a bad guy enjoying using/tool fetchon an zombie army of never upgraded Mikrotik routers to DDoS a Mikrotik forum.
