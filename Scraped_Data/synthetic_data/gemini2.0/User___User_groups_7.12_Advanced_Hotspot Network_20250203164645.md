Okay, let's dive deep into configuring user and user groups on a MikroTik RouterOS 7.12 device, specifically for a hotspot network using the given subnet and interface. This is going to be an advanced level configuration, as requested.

## Scenario Description:

We are configuring a hotspot network on a MikroTik router using the `bridge-26` interface, assigned to subnet `53.19.242.0/24`. We'll create user groups with varying access limits and then create individual users associated with those groups. This will allow us to control bandwidth, access times, and other parameters for different categories of hotspot users.  This configuration will be done via both CLI and winbox.

## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Create User Groups

**Explanation:** We'll start by defining user groups. These groups will have specific policies assigned to them, such as bandwidth limits and access times.

**Before:** The default state will have no user groups defined.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/user group
add name=guest policy=read,write,test
add name=premium policy=read,write,test,api,password
```

**Winbox GUI:**
1. Navigate to `/Users/User Groups`.
2. Click the `+` button.
3. Enter `guest` as the `Name`.
4. Check the `read` `write` and `test` policy check boxes.
5. Press `OK`.
6. Repeat step 2 to create the `premium` user group.
7. Enter `premium` as the `Name`.
8. Check the `read`, `write`, `test`, `api` and `password` policy check boxes.
9. Press `OK`.

**Effect:** This creates two new user groups: `guest` and `premium`. The `premium` group has more permissions than the `guest` group.
**After:** New user groups are defined with specific policies.

### Step 2: Create User Profiles (Optional, but Good Practice)

**Explanation:** User profiles are optional, but helpful if you want to predefine bandwidth and other limits to be applied when user creation.  User profiles are referenced in user creation.

**Before:** No user profiles exist.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/user profile
add name=guest_profile  rate-limit=1M/1M comment="Guest bandwidth profile"
add name=premium_profile rate-limit=5M/5M comment="Premium bandwidth profile"
```

**Winbox GUI:**
1. Navigate to `/Users/Profiles`.
2. Click the `+` button.
3. Enter `guest_profile` as the `Name`.
4.  Enter `1M/1M` in the `rate-limit` field.
5. Add the comment `Guest bandwidth profile`.
6. Press `OK`.
7. Repeat step 2 to create the `premium_profile` user group.
8. Enter `premium_profile` as the `Name`.
9. Enter `5M/5M` in the `rate-limit` field.
10. Add the comment `Premium bandwidth profile`.
11. Press `OK`.

**Effect:** This creates two user profiles named `guest_profile` with 1Mbps up/down limit, and `premium_profile` with 5Mbps up/down.

**After:** New user profiles are created with specific rate limits.

### Step 3: Create Users

**Explanation:** We'll create individual users associated with the user groups and user profiles, setting their username, password, and other specific parameters.

**Before:** No specific users configured yet.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/user
add name=guest1 password=guest1 group=guest profile=guest_profile disabled=no comment="Guest user"
add name=premium1 password=premium1 group=premium profile=premium_profile disabled=no comment="Premium user"
```

**Winbox GUI:**
1. Navigate to `/Users`.
2. Click the `+` button.
3. Enter `guest1` as the `Name`.
4. Enter `guest1` as the `Password`.
5. Select `guest` from the `Group` drop down.
6. Select `guest_profile` from the `Profile` drop down.
7. Check the `Enabled` check box.
8. Add the comment `Guest user`.
9. Press `OK`.
10. Repeat step 2 to create the `premium1` user.
11. Enter `premium1` as the `Name`.
12. Enter `premium1` as the `Password`.
13. Select `premium` from the `Group` drop down.
14. Select `premium_profile` from the `Profile` drop down.
15. Check the `Enabled` check box.
16. Add the comment `Premium user`.
17. Press `OK`.

**Effect:** This creates two users: `guest1` in the `guest` group and `premium1` in the `premium` group. They are assigned their respective user profiles.

**After:** Users are created, assigned to groups, and user profiles.

### Step 4: Verify User Access

**Explanation:** After the users are setup, the users have to be configured within your preferred service, ie, Hotspot, PPoE, etc.

**Before:** The service (ie hotspot) is configured and functional.

**CLI Command:**

No specific commands for user group verification.

**Winbox GUI:**

1. Check to see if any logs are present in `/System/Logs`.  Successful logins will appear here.

**Effect:** This confirms that the users created are able to login via the configured method.

**After:** Successful user verification and log confirmation.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/user group
add name=guest policy=read,write,test
add name=premium policy=read,write,test,api,password

/user profile
add name=guest_profile rate-limit=1M/1M comment="Guest bandwidth profile"
add name=premium_profile rate-limit=5M/5M comment="Premium bandwidth profile"

/user
add name=guest1 password=guest1 group=guest profile=guest_profile disabled=no comment="Guest user"
add name=premium1 password=premium1 group=premium profile=premium_profile disabled=no comment="Premium user"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Incorrect Password:** Ensure passwords are typed correctly when creating users, and communicate them accurately to the user.
*   **Incorrect User Group Assignment:** Verify users are added to the correct user groups based on intended access level. Double check names.
*   **Incorrect User Profiles:** Verify that user profiles are applied correctly, as misconfiguration can cause incorrect bandwidth usage for users.
*   **Service Not Setup:** Make sure your users are authenticated by the service you are trying to use. Ie, radius server, hotspot, etc.
*   **Hotspot not enabled:** If you are using hotspot, make sure it is properly enabled and configured. `/ip hotspot`
*   **Log Issues:** If logs are not appearing when attempting to login, verify the log settings in `/system/logging`.  Make sure logs are set to `info` or higher for troubleshooting.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Login:** Log in using the created usernames and passwords through the service you setup. If using a hotspot, try to login via the hotspot web page, if using PPoE, use your operating system to establish a PPoE connection.
2.  **Bandwidth Check:** Use a speed test tool (such as speedtest.net) to verify bandwidth is correctly capped for both guest and premium users.
3.  **Monitor Active Users:**  Check the active connections in `/ip hotspot active` (if applicable) to verify users are connected.
4.  **System Logs:** Review system logs (`/log`) for successful user authentications and errors.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Hotspot User Management:** Using the MikroTik Hotspot feature in combination with user and user groups provides a comprehensive solution for managing public access networks.
*   **Radius Server:** For larger deployments, consider using an external RADIUS server for centralized user authentication and management.
*   **User Manager:**  MikroTik's User Manager package provides an alternative way to manage users, profiles, and vouchers.
*   **Time-Based Access:** Create user profiles with time-based restrictions using the `valid-until` parameter.
*   **Bandwidth Control:** In addition to the user profiles, traffic control can be configured with `/queue tree` for advanced traffic shaping.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

While user management is best done through RouterOS directly, here's a partial example using the REST API to retrieve a list of users:

**API Endpoint:** `/rest/user`

**Request Method:** `GET`

**Example Curl Command:**

```bash
curl -k -u "api_user:api_password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://<router-ip>/rest/user
```

**Example Response (JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    ".id": "*2",
    "name": "guest1",
    "group": "guest",
	 "profile": "guest_profile",
    "disabled": false,
	 "comment":"Guest user"
  },
    {
    ".id": "*3",
    "name": "premium1",
    "group": "premium",
	 "profile": "premium_profile",
    "disabled": false,
	 "comment":"Premium user"
  }
]
```

*Error handling: If the provided credentials are invalid, a 401 error will be returned.  If the API is disabled, a 404 error will be returned.  In both cases, the request will not succeed.

**Parameter Explanations:**
-  `.id`: Internal MikroTik user ID.
- `name`: The username of the user.
- `group`: The user group assigned.
- `profile`: The user profile assigned.
- `disabled`:  Boolean value indicating if the user is disabled.
- `comment`: The users comment field.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce the use of strong passwords for all user accounts.
*   **API Access Control:** If using the API, restrict API access to specific IP addresses and use strong API user credentials.
*   **Regular Auditing:** Regularly audit user accounts, user groups, and their assigned policies.
*  **Disable Default Users:**  Disable any default users like admin if not needed, or use a very strong password for these users.
* **Limit user permissions:** If you are creating API users, limit the permissions to only what is needed for that user.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **More Granular User Control:** In real-world deployments, there would likely be a need for more fine-grained bandwidth control and time-based access. For this, consider using a RADIUS server for advanced user session control.
*   **Dynamic User Management:** A dynamic approach where users are created on demand via a web portal or the API would be more scalable for a large hotspot network.
*   **Traffic Classification:** Advanced traffic classification via mangle and queue trees would be required to ensure different kinds of traffic do not overwhelm the system.
*   **Logging:** Implement robust logging for user login/logout events for security and troubleshooting.
*   **External radius server**: As scale increases, a local database for users can become cumbersome.  Using an external database can greatly assist in scaling.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic:

MikroTik user management through user groups provides a structured approach for controlling access and resources within your network. User groups enable you to apply policies to a set of users all at once and simplify the management of multiple users.  Individual users are then configured with a unique username, password and are assigned to their respective user group and user profile.  This simplifies the administration of a large number of users, and improves overall security and performance of the network.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Built-in vs. RADIUS:** The built-in MikroTik user management is suitable for small to medium-sized networks. For larger networks, external RADIUS servers offer scalability, central management, and more advanced features.
*   **User Groups vs. Individual Policies:**  While you can technically set unique policies for each user, it becomes unwieldy quickly as the number of users increase. User groups simplify management by organizing users by their respective resource needs.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Directly applying rate limits via the user profile provides a basic way to limit user bandwidth. For advanced traffic shaping and bandwidth management per user, MikroTik's Queue Tree is much more powerful and offers more control.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This guide is specifically targeting RouterOS 7.12, but it is also backwards compatible with the syntax used in RouterOS 6.48 and later versions of 7.x. There are no major differences in syntax across those versions for basic user management. However, be sure to always check your changelogs to make sure any new functionality does not interfere with your configuration.
