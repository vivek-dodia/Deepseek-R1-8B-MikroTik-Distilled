No line of sight, this is a residence.This is in a rural area; Property is about 5 acres / 2 hectares.  Noise is low.I FULLY admit, the router is not in an ideal location (and I'm not debating that).I'm arguing the point that the hAP ax3 is worse than the hAP ax2 (which, shouldn't be).The fact that there are many posts related to this, leads me to believe that there is something wrong with the hAP ax3 (likely, something simple and overlooked).I dont think it would have anything to do with the config (especially, since the same config works way better on a hAP ax2).7.11.3, 7.12.1, 7.13 all were identical.Again, the hAP ax3 replaced an AirCube and most devices did not even have adequate signal to even connect (and those that did were pretty bad)Then the hAP ax3 was replaced with a hAP ax2 and signals improved dramatically, all devices connected, etc.Tried skipping DFS channels.  Tried setting antenna gain.  Tried setting power levels.  Tried setting chains.  Nothing made a difference.Both devices are configured with a simple hacked together script we use (Global variables just allow us to not have to type things multiple times), built off of a default config from an ax2 so there shouldn't be anything  very "special" in here.Code:Select all

I also have weird problems with AX3 on 7.13 WiFi speed. My test is copying big file from NAS that is directly attached to the router's ethernet. With AC2 at the same place, speeds were nicely 50-55MB/sec.1: Windows 11 connects over 5GHz AC: link speed shown in computer: 780/780, real speed during copying of file: 1-2.2MB/s2: Macbook Air 15" M2 connects over 5GHz AX, link speed shown in client 864, in winbox 286, real speed 10-11MB/s. Really weird is that Tx Rate is shown differently in client and router and never goes over 286Mbps for this client.ax3-wifi-problem.pngMy WiFi configuration:Code:Select all

Really weird is that Tx Rate is shown differently in client and router and never goes over 286Mbps for this client.I've a weird request. Can you please do aCode:Select allon ax^3 and see what results you get with the tests this way?And just to make sure, was the version oh ac^2 the same? Was the config identical? Were the frequencies used the same, was the activity of the connected devices the same? Was the interference likely to be the same?What I really want is just for somebody (if you have time and energy for experimenting, it'd be cool if you did that) to please just put an ax^3 against ax^2/ac^2 with the same exact configuration and in the same exact (or as similar as you can provide) conditions, and make a little semi-scientific report on it. The easiest way is to use default config, default SSID, set band, channel witdth, frequency and TX power and only one device. Better use an open network or WPA2 PSK, it's more stable. Just roleplay a nuclear physicist: if you're wrong about something, it goes kaboom, so better check.All of this will instantly either prove or disprove that there's something wrong with the hAP ax^3 on a fundamental level. It's called a sanity check.If this test shows that performances are similar between ax^3 and ax^2/ac^2, you can then start adding config options or devices to the network to try and figure out when exactly the network starts breaking.If this test shows that performances are radically different between ax^3 and ax^2/ac^2, with ax^3 being considerably worse, then you can open a ticket with MikroTik, provide them with solid scientific evidence that there's something wrong with the hAP ax^3 and wait for their reply.

Hmmm... I have a similar situation here...I recently got the ax3 to replace a hap ac. With a probably generations newer device and especially external antennas I expected it to provide much faster speeds (because of better coverage) in some "remoter" room of my house. Turns out where the hap ac had at least a "low signal", the ax3 had basically "no signal". I tested various frequencies, but still no luck so far / hard to even get a signal.I could see a difference when some channel had a dramatically lower tx power (country restricted / I tested with fixed channels), but strangely no difference when playing with antenna gain. Unfortunately I could not see any "effective" value for antenna gain (as in the status for "tx power"), but I would expect at least some effect in the signal strength when switching antenna gain from 0 to 5 or even 6, no?Sorry might also just be too much of a wifi noob, but I fear you are NOT hallucinating.My config is pretty much default, except that I obviously tried to boost the coverage - tx power will be restricted to 17 or 24 depending on the channel because of country regulations...Code:Select all

Just for kicks and giggles, here are my numbers for Audience (RBD25G-5HPacQD2HPnD), channel 149 Ceee, obtained using a Samsung Galaxy A54 5G, running OneUI 6.0 (Android 14).Audience would be placed on wooden floor, then my phone with WiFi Analyzer open would be placed directed towards it but with the back touching the floor, so that the distance between the center of the base of the Audience and the center of the screen of the phone would be 1 meter. I used a metallic tape measure to eyeball the phone position. I would hold its 100cm position down on top of Audience with my right hand so that the rest of the tape measure would stay in the air, and would place the phone under the 0cm position on the tape measure with my left hand, observing and aligning it from the top. After positioning, metallic tape measure would be removed from the scene not to interfere with the WiFi signal. Sometimes I would make tiny adjustments to the rotation of the phone, to make sure that the phone is pointing towards the Audience. I would then wait 30 seconds for WiFi Analyzer to stabilize and update itself and then observe it for 1-3 more minutes to get the maximum and minimum observed values of signal strength.Here's the table with raw data that I gathered, plus the calculated average ((Max+Min)/2) and the rough estimation of random error (Max-Avg).Code:Select allI disqualified the value for 3dBm, left side, because of the relatively high error, and because the value didn't make much sense compared to other values. With that accounted for, the final table for maximum observed signal strength values, along with their respective errors:Code:Select allNow, negative numbers aren't exactly famous for being straightforward, so here's a table with adjusted values, where AdjMax=Max+64dBm, to align the minimum perceived signal strength in the previous table with minimum used TX power. Since we are comparing everything to the base value of 3, we will treat it as fixed (measured perfectly) and move its error onto the other values to account for it.Code:Select allWhat we did here was basically measure the real observed amplification with an assumption that we somehow measured the perceived signal strength for TX Power set to 3dBm perfectly, which was necessary because in reality we have no baseline. If we measured the error for 3dBm correctly and if the device is outputting on 3dBm correctly (which would be more or less true even if the amplifier was dead, 0 dBm ≈ 3 dBm with the random error values observed), this assumption will not affect our results for other values, because we moved the error from 3dBm to other values.You can thus see that observed amplification for TX Power set to 13 dBm is "very likely to be from 8 to 13 dBm", "extremely likely to be from 5.5 to 15.5 dBm", and the observed amplification for TX Power set to 20 dBm is "very likely to be from 19 to 23 dBm", "extremely likely to be from 17 to 25 dBm".That's just how random errors work, but the point is, 13 dBm is 13 dBm within margin of error and 20 dBm is 20 dBm within margin of error. This allows us to conclude, with absolute scientific certainty, that the signal amplifier in my Audience is indeed working.

In-deed I did similar test (measured actually even before posting here). No Android here, so I tested with my iPhone reading out signal strength values from "Registration" tab on the Mikrotiks (not sure how much sense those make, but it was the most consistent values I could get).In that particular room I got... (just 2 of the more distinct examples)on the hap acCode:Select allon the hap ax3Code:Select all...that's not "totally broken" (given that room was already kind of a challenge for the hap ac) but with that newer device and external antennas I'd expected it to be the other way round.Particularly worried I'm more about the antenna gain. As said I tested values from 0 to 6 with basically NO effect on signal strength. Is that normal?

We were fortunate to move to a larger property and house in July '23 and I took this as an opportunity to replace hAP ac (v1) units with hAP hAP ax3devices with RB5009 acting as a central CAPsMAN and router. I use my home network as an extension of my office and do R&D for 802.1X testing so I have a relatively complex setup where each AP provides 3 SSIDs:WPA2-PSK for family and IoT (DHCP pool range is blocked from internet breakout, to allow for manual onboarding (simply making dynamic assignments static, setting a comment as reference and then finally allocating an IP outside of the pool range, which ultimately allows internet access)WPA3-EAP (RADIUS) for TLS authentication for access to the office network and immersive VPN (corporate devices, like my laptop)WPA3-PSK (RADIUS) for a captive portal where guests can register themselves and have time/bandwidth limits (primarily so that I can track down abusers to cell phone numbers used during self-registration)When we first moved in the house had a single ISP provided CPE that handled PPPoE and dual band 2/5 GHz WiFi which worked amazingly well, I managed to setup a DNAT on the ISP router to the RB5009 so that I had external access (configuration revisioning via Oxidized and monitoring via Zabbix) and expected 802.1ax to perform even better. Wow, was I wrong...I believe the crux of the matter to be that South Africa, where I reside, to simply have been lazy and copy & pasted the European WiFi regulations. Apartment living in Europe would create a lot of interference, so the country regulation settings restrict transmit power to 100 mW (0.1 W). The property is 16,000 m2, so I subsequently pickuped neighbour's WiFi SSIDs stronger than the hAP ax3around our house. I could not pickup any trace of my SSIDs outside the house, let alone along the perimeter wall.Changing the country to Taiwan, where regulations allow for 1000 mW (1 W) of transmit power, made a substantial difference though and transmit power (Status tab of the main AP, references as Tx Power) went up from 16 dBm to 27 dBm. Remember that dBm is logarithmic, so 16 -> 27 is equivalent to a x10 increase. From what I've read in other forum posts the APs should automatically reduce Tx Power by the AP's included antennea, but I do see an increase via Android WiFi Analyzer when I manually set the main SSIDs with antenna-gain=0.Living in South Africa has another super annoying frustration, in that our government is completely incapable of governing anything and instead plunders state owned enterprises (SOE). You would think that population would subsequently vote them out but a lack of basic education and per-child low income grants keeps the mass populous committed to revoting for the dominant political party. The result is an ailing power utility (Eskom), which has both a monopoly but can't reliably keep the lights on and we subsequently have scheduled load shedding multiple times a day where there simply isn't power. The reason this is relevant, is that even with us having self sufficient off-grid solar, there are still instances where APs restart concurrently; primarily due to failures at electricity substations when components fail due to them heating (expanding) and then cooling down (shrinking) multiple times a day as a result of the load shedding (ie power often doesn't return when it's supposed to, resulting in batteries running down to a level where the inverter turns off when it's a cloudy/rainy day).The result is that APs concurrently initialise, selecting the same channel and then interfere with each other. I ultimately manually selected the 2.4 GHz channel for each AP, but there are only 3 non-overlapping channels to choose from in the 2.4 GHz band so I set those on opposite ends of the house, particularly upstairs/downstairs, to run on the same channel as the brick/concrete walls become metres thick when drawing a straight line between them.After months of tinkering I have things working relatively well, I did however roll back from 7.13.1 to 7.13 as this was causing mobile devices (iPhones and Google Pixel 7) to often revert to LTE whilst over 150 IoT devices around the house also locked on APs that are further away than those relatively close (most probably the issue with beacons having a country of Latvia hard coded in 7.13.1 (known bug)). The following may help others in attaining a better experience, currently works better than Ubiquiti WiFi 6 APs and Aruba WiFi 6 APs.Summary:APs are all LAN wired with various VLANs (assigned via RADIUS (PacketFence)).Fast Transition (fast roaming) with LAN hand over (ft-over-ds) ensures that clients can roam between APs when wireless communication between the APs is weak.PMKID is disabled on all SSIDs.Management protection is required for WPA3 networks and allowed for WPA2 (optional).wireless to wireless isolation is in effect on the WPA3-PSK, but this doesn't appear to limit wireless clients connecting to different APs.2.4 GHz radios have their channels set manually, 5 GHz hardly extends outside a single room due to everything being concrete/brick and mortar.WPA3-PSK has the password advertised as part of the SSID, the reason for this (as opposed to running an open network) is that there is still per connection encryption between each AP and the relevant client whereas an open network would result in packets in flight being unencrypted.RADIUS controlled SSIDs have a bogus VLAN assigned (3999), to ensure that clients land in the VLAN sent along with the RADIUS accept responseNBPlease use a WiFi analyzer to ensure that you do not cause interference with neighbours, let alone doppler radar (can lead to air craft disasters) when changing the country to essentially break the law by transmitting beyond what the laws attempt to regulate.Code:Select allPS: I prefer for APs to stop transmitting a given SSIDs when they loose contact with CAPsMAN. This however results in provisioned wifi interfaces incrementing from wifi1,wifi2,wifi3,wifi4,wifi5,wifi6 to wifi1,wifi2,wifi7,wifi8,wifi9,wifi10. This causes a problem with the VLAN bridge configurations on each CAP so I have a simply script which runs every minute and restarts the device when uptime is > 10 minutes and wifi3 doesn't exist. I can gladly share full sanitised CAP configs should anyone request them.

I have found the culprit for my WiFi speed slowness on AX3, an old configuration habit: /interface/bridge/setprotocol-mode=noneWhen I set it back to default protocol-mode=rtsp, then instantly WiFi speed gets fixed and I can easily see TX rate 1200Mbps.In the wiki there's a mention of "If the CAP is hAP ax2 or hAP ax3, it is strongly recommended to enable RSTP in the bridge configuration, on the CAP", but nothing about reason for this. I don't have neither Capsman nor CAP mode enabled.

hAP ax3 wireless problem ... difficult to solve ... maybe it is because there is a combination of reasons why it fails.So far recently if have seen 3 "possible" causes here, when using the ax device out of the box, or after upgrade.. Depending which one hits you, the solution is different. If multiple causes are active, solving only one, will not show good wireless.Maybe this is in your case, maybe it is not ..- ax2/ax3 chipset with ROS 7.12 onwards allow for the frequencies above 5700MHz. ROS prefers those frequencies They are non-DFS and usually strong TX power allowed (in USA, under FCC region)- ROS 7.13.1 changed the default country to Latvia. The TX power allowed for 2.4GHz now drops from 30 dBm to 20 dBm (10x lower). The allowed TX power for freq above 5700 MHz is now SRD level (SR= short range) or only 14 dBm as for the whole ETSI region. (40x lower). ROS still prefers these frequencies, and uses them if not told otherwise.Code:Select all- the long ear antenna on hAP ac3/ax3 are not with strong gain, and are omnidirectional in 2D for the 2.4GHz , but not for the 5GHz band. In 5 GHz band the sideway gain is 4.7 dB lower (3x lower)- this further reduces the SRD short range to a very very short range. (total TX power reduction is 120x)- ax2/ax3 problems with HW ofloading of the bridge to the IPQ_PPE switch have been reported. Transmission rates greatly reduced.- Very strong USB3 interference is reported on ax3, and can maybe be seen on ac3/ax3 with a scan in the 2.4GHz band on ac3/ax3 (Is it that my phantom high power transmitter with strange 00:00:00:00:80:00 MAC?) Connections repeatedly drop in the 2.4GHz band.

Meanwhile, I've gone through the tab auto-completion list and tested countries that allow broadcasting in 5735-5835 MHz range. All settings the same. For 5180/Ceee frequency was obviously changed to 5180. It seems like 28 dBm is max power for 5745/Ceee and 23 dBm is max power for 5180/Ceee.Antenna-gain value of 0 seems to be ignored in some cases for some countries, despite no min-antenna-gain value being present in `/interface/wifi/radio/print detail`. Choosing some countries results in application of European regulatory rules, but not necessarily for all frequencies. Overall, pretty confusing.Edit: It seems that I'm somewhat late to the party. This problemhas already been discussed here.

All wireless 5Ghz clients are disconnected simultaneously and the "Link Down" counter increases by 1. After 10-15 seconds, the connection is restored. This looks like restarting the radio module. In the log it looks like a 'connection lost' for all connected clients.And this happens about 3-4 times a day.Is it possible that this is a hardware problem specifically for my device?

today's update:I've also received hap ax2.I made a final comparison of 5ghz wifi speed and the far room on 2nd floor where my computer is with decent intel wifi and antenna.with hap-ac2 I got around 55mbit dlink and 55 mbit uplinkwith hap-ax3 best I got was 72mbit dlink and 46 mbit uplink. Most of the time it's 60-65 mbit/swith hap-ax2 right out the box I put it into the same place and got 136 mbit/s dlink and 91mbit/s uplink.Every router has pretty much the same configuration and 7.16.1 version. I've tried many possible antenna angles, checked antenna's radiation pattern, tried different wifi channels and different test devices (I have few more laptops/ipads/smartphones, they all have very similar results) I also make tests at the same time of the day. To make sure there is no big load on the network.I'll be returning ax3 and will order one more ax2 for best coverage.
