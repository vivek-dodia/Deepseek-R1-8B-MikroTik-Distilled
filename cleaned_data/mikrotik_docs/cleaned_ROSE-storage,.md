ROSE (RouterOS Enterprise)package adds data center functionality to RouterOS - for supporting disk monitoring, improved formatting, RAIDs, rsync, iSCSI ,NVMe over TCP, NFS. This functionality currently is supported onarm, arm64, x86andtileplatforms.
# Storage Type
# Crypted
Drive or device used together with type=crypted to make "dm_crypt" encrypted storage.dm-cryptis a transparent disk encryption subsystem designed to provide encryption of block devices.
```
dm-crypt
```
# Properties
Property | Description
----------------------
slot(string;Default: ) | Name of theÂ  file system
encryption-key(string;Default: ) | key used to decrypt
crypted-backend(string;Default: ) | Drive or partition to encrypt
# Configuration example:
To create a crypted file-system:
```
add crypted-backend=usb1 encryption-key=strong_key slot=crypted-usb1 type=crypted
```
After it's created format the file system and it's ready to go.
```

```
# iSCSI
iSCSIallows accessing storage over an IP-based network. On initiator iSCSI device will appear as block device. RouterOS supports both target and initiator modes.
# Properties
Property | Description
----------------------
iscasi-address | IP address of the iSCSI target. (Host device IP)
iscasi-export | Disables/enables iSCASI on the host device
iscasi-iqn | unique identifier used to name iSCSI target. (In ROS the iqn is the same as slot name, can't be changed and needs to be configured only on the client device)
iscasi-port | network port used by the iSCSI target to listen for incoming connections from initiators. The default port for iSCSI traffic is 3260.
# Configuration example
Host
```
/disk
set pcie1-nvme1 iscsi-export=yes

```
subnqn should match the slot name and will be used as -n parameter:
```
nvme connect -t tcp -a 192.168.1.1 -s 4420 -n pcie1-nvme1
```
Block devices now should be available:
```
ls /dev/nvme*
```
/dev/nvme0  /dev/nvme0n1  /dev/nvme-fabrics
```
To disconnect:
```
nvme disconnect -d /dev/nvme0
```
where /dev/nvme0 previously mounted device, or disconnect all:
```
nvme disconnect-all
```

Sets the drive in a failed state in RAID array. Used if there is a need to change a non-failed drive
# Configuration example (RAID6):
This is an example on how to configure RAID, it will be the same procedure in most of RAID types
Create the RAID block device (In this example, RAID 6)
```
add raid-device-count=20 raid-type=6 slot=raid1 type=raid
```
Add drives to this raid
```
set nvme1 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0
set nvme2 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=1
set nvme3 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=2
set nvme4 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=3
set nvme5 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=4

set nvme9 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=8
set nvme10 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=9
set nvme11 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=10
set nvme12 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=11
set nvme13 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=12
set nvme14 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=13
set nvme15 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=14

```
Format the RAID block device
```
disk> format-drive raid1 file-system=btrfs
```
And the result should look similar to this
```
21 BM        type=raid slot="raid1" slot-default="" parent=none uuid="f457bc79-7408-489b-8850-85923e900452" fs=btrfs model="RAID6 2-parity-disks"

```
# RAID 0
All data is written evenly over all disks in this RAID, this configuration does not provide any fault tolerance but provides best performance.
# RAID 1
Same data is written in all drives (data is mirrored), this configuration provides best fault tolerance, but performance wise write speeds will be equal to slowest disk used in array.
# RAID 4
Block-level data is striped to a dedicated disk where parity bits are stored. Performance will be limited to a parity writing speed.
# RAID 5
Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. Can be recovered from 1 disk failure.
# RAID 6
Block-level data is striped evenly over the available disks. Can be recovered from 2 disk failures.
# RAID Linear
Data is appended over multiple disks combining them into single large disk. Provides no redundancy and is limited to single disk read/write speed.
# Nested RAID
Combination of multiple RAID configurations into other RAID. For example RAID 10 (RAID 1+0) combines disk mirroring (RAID 1) and disk striping (RAID 0)
# Configuration example
In this example I'm using 20 SSD drives and configuring in RAID (RAID 1+0)
Create a RAID 1 block
```
add raid-device-count=2 raid-type=1 slot=raid10 type=raid
```
Crete two RAID 0 blocks and add them to set the master-raid the previously created RAID 1 block (name=raid10)
```
add raid-device-count=10 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=0 raid-type=0 slot=raid0 type=raid
add raid-device-count=10 raid-master=raid10 raid-role=1 raid-type=0 slot=raid1 type=raid
```
Add drives to each RAID block
```
set nvme1 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=0
set nvme2 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=1
set nvme3 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=2
set nvme4 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=3
set nvme5 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=4
set nvme6 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=5
set nvme7 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=6
set nvme8 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=7
set nvme9 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=8
set nvme10 raid-master=raid1 raid-role=9
set nvme11 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=0
set nvme12 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=1
set nvme13 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=2
set nvme14 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=3
set nvme15 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=4
set nvme16 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=5
set nvme17 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=6
set nvme18 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=7
set nvme19 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=8
set nvme20 raid-master=raid0 raid-role=9
```
After this format, the raid10 block
```
format-drive raid10 file-system=btrfs
```
After formating you should see the free space and use the block
```
23 BM        type=raid slot="raid10" slot-default="" parent=none uuid="ec3344f4-1662-49ab-b899-db1aaa217b0f" fs=btrfs model="RAID1 mirrored" size=9 601 967 652 864

```
# RSYNC
rsync(Remote Sync) is a powerful file synchronization and file transfer program used in Unix-based systems. It allows for efficient transfer and synchronization of files and directories between different systems or within the same system.If you make changes in a file only changes to files are transferred, reducing data transfer volume. RouterOS RSYNC implementation uses ipsec forÂ data transfer (if password is set). When configured you will see dynamic ipsec entries.
```
rsync
```
Rsync settings can be found in file/sync menu
IPSec dynamic entry example:
```
# PEER                     TUNNEL  SRC-ADDRESS       DST-ADDRESS       PROTOCOL  ACTION   LEVEL    PH2-COUNT
;;; file-sync-10.155.145.11

# Properties
Property | Description
----------------------
local-path | File/folder path. Used for modeUploadto set the path of the file/folder to upload to the device
mode | Sets if you want to download/upload the file (direction of the sync)
password | Target device password
remote-address | Target devices IP
remote-path | File/folder path. Used with modedownloadto set the path of the target device to be downloaded
user | Target device password

user
# Configuration example
Basic configuration is really easy, on the host device you need to add the file you want to sync to another device, the ip, user/password and the mode.
```
/file sync
add local-path=/ipv6route.txt.rsc mode=upload remote-address=192.168.88.2 remote-path=RAID/
```
If configured correctly, you will see on the host device:
```
0 192.168.88.2  upload  /ipv6route.txt.rsc  RAID/        in sync
```
And on the client device:
```
# REMOTE-ADDRESS   MODE      LOCAL-PATH  REMOTE-PATH         STATUS
0 D 192.168.88.1 download  RAID/       /ipv6route.txt.rsc  in sync
```
# Self-Encryption Drives
For using SED - drives have to beOpal-compliant. Please consult drive manufacturers documentation to find out if particular drive supports this feature before buying drives.RouterOS addso (supported inactive)orO (supported active)flags for supported drives:
```
/disk print
