## Bridge Setup in MikroTik RouterOS 6.x

### Configuration Scenario and Requirements

- Create a bridge interface to connect multiple physical interfaces.
- Assign IP addresses to the bridge interface and the connected devices.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create the bridge interface:**
   - Navigate to **Interfaces** > **Bridge** > **+**.
2. **Configure the bridge parameters:**
   - Enter a name for the bridge, e.g., **br0**.
   - Click **Apply**.
3. **Add physical interfaces to the bridge:**
   - Select the bridge interface.
   - Click the **+** button under **Ports**.
   - Select the physical interfaces you want to bridge.
4. **Assign an IP address to the bridge:**
   - Navigate to **IP** > **Addresses** > **Add New**.
   - Select the bridge interface from the **Interface** dropdown.
   - Enter the desired IP address and network mask.
   - Click **Apply**.
5. **Assign IP addresses to the connected devices:**
   - Navigate to **IP** > **Addresses** > **Add New**.
   - Select the physical interface connected to the device.
   - Enter the desired IP address and network mask.
   - Click **Apply**.

### Complete Configuration Commands

```
/interface bridge add name=br0
/interface bridge port add bridge=br0 interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=br0 interface=ether2
/ip address add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=br0
/ip address add address=192.168.1.10/24 interface=ether1
/ip address add address=192.168.1.20/24 interface=ether2
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

- **Bridge not forwarding traffic:** Ensure that the bridge ports are configured correctly and that the firewall rules allow traffic to pass through.
- **IP address conflict:** Verify that there are no duplicate IP addresses assigned to the bridge or the connected devices.
- **Incorrect subnet mask:** Ensure that the subnet mask is correct for the IP address range used.

### Verification and Testing Steps

1. **Ping the bridge interface:** `ping 192.168.1.1` should succeed from any connected device.
2. **Test connectivity between devices:** `ping 192.168.1.20` from a device connected to the `ether1` interface should succeed.

### Related Features and Considerations

- **VLANs:** VLANs can be used to create logical subnets on the same physical network.
- **MAC filtering:** MAC filtering can be used to control access to the bridge.
- **Security:** It's recommended to use strong firewall rules to protect the bridge and connected devices from unauthorized access.
