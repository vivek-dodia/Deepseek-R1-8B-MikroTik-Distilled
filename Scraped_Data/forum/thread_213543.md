On:https://mikrotik.com/support- there is a new AI chat bot, it seems to work pretty well for some basic questions I throw at it.But does it feed with the actual /help docs or has some unreleased documentation?!When asking for IPSEC VTI support for example it is convinced Mikrotik supports it and even generates a configration for me with using "/interface vti" cli?Is VTI coming? Or is The Dude throwing false alarms?How do others experience this new "the dude" AI?

There's another nugget of information that could indicate that there's active work on VTI: a reddit user noticed that there's now asupport matrix indicating /31 subnet support for v7.18in theofficial routing documentation. While the two features definitely do not depend on one another, it's a typical use case to setup a VTI interface with a /31 subnet.Or the AI could be hallucinating, of course.
