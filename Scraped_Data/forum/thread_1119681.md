Hi guys, please bare with me for a while ...I have a RB960PGS and I thought it could be used for powering 4 Raspberry Pi 5's that are equipped with M.2/PoE hats used for 37+ Volt ... and yes, I did replace the PSU with one providing 48V and 2A.All I really need from the PoE hEX is the power and the ability to run Vlan's, no routing, no firewalling, nothing ...Started of by configuring the L2 on the Ether1 - 5 using a Bridge, all was fine but it degraded the bandwidth from around 930 Mbps as I was used to and I got around 860...ish... instead, good but not ok due to my OCD ...... so I inserted a 1 Gbps SFP into the SFP bay, purely for management and configured an IP address and nothing else, as I said it was just for management, even disabled IP forwarding in IP settings ...Port Ether1 is the trunk to my uplink switch, running an unused Vlan as default and then Vlan 100 and 68 tagged, same from the uplink switch. On port Ether 2 - 5, the PoE ports, the Raspberry Pi's are connected, all with Vlan 100 as default ( =untagged) and Ether2 and 5 also have Vlan 68 tagged. All this is done solely in the Switch configuraton of the PoE hEX, nothing is done under Bridge or Interfaces, nothing and it works great giving me the bandwidth I want ... except ...... once every 20-30 hours I lose connectivity to one, as it seem, random Raspberry Pi, they are stil active on their ethernet interface, I can see both rx and tx traffic but I lose IP connectivity to them, on all ports they should respond to. Now, this did not seem to happen when I used the Bridge configuration which I did for more than a week ...Any ideas or similar experiences?Have a nice evening!//Anders

There are many examples of such in the forums,  and also a ref with examples.viewtopic.php?t=143620

I don't think that covers using the Qualcom/Atheros switch chip in the hEX PoE, only VLAN-aware bridges which would be handled by the CPU in this case and not achieve anything near wire-speed throughput.I've not had any slowdowns when configuring VLAN support directly on the switch chip, the existing configuration may provide a clue.

Here is all relevant documentation on how to configure:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... upExamplesMake sure you read all comments on the QCA8337, because it has some exceptions.Can you share the current config?Code:Select all/exportfile=anynameyoulikeRemove serial and any other private info, post between code tags by using the </> button.

All is currently handled by the CPU, while you should have VLAN filtering handled by the switch chip.Something like this should work:Code:Select all/interfacebridgeaddname=bridge1 protocol-mode=none/interfacewireless security-profilesset[finddefault=yes]supplicant-identity=PoE-RTR-1/interfacebridge portaddbridge=bridge1interface=ether1addbridge=bridge1interface=ether2addbridge=bridge1interface=ether3addbridge=bridge1interface=ether4addbridge=bridge1interface=ether5/interfaceethernetswitchportset0vlan-mode=secureset1vlan-mode=secureset2default-vlan-id=100vlan-mode=secureset3default-vlan-id=100vlan-mode=secureset4vlan-mode=secureset5vlan-mode=secure/interfaceethernetswitchvlanaddindependent-learning=noports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5switch=switch1 vlan-id=100addindependent-learning=noports=ether1,ether2,ether5switch=switch1 vlan-id=68Please check the attached link for full explanation.Btw, above config is based on a v6 config. Might be some small differences.

All is currently handled by the CPU, while you should have VLAN filtering handled by the switch chip..Hi agin, based on your suggested config I actually just added .../interface ethernet switch portset 1 vlan-mode=secureset 2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 3 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 4 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 5 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secure/interface ethernet switch vlanadd independent-learning=no ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=100add independent-learning=no ports=ether1,ether2,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=68... and this is pretty much all I need as it seem. This also give me full interface speed ... but I will continue to go through the referenced link  as well.Have a nice weekend.//Anders
