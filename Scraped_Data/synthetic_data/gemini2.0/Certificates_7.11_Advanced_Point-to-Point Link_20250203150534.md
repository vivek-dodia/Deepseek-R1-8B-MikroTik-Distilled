Okay, let's dive deep into managing certificates on MikroTik RouterOS, specifically within the context of your point-to-point link, focusing on a practical, real-world implementation using the provided subnet and VLAN ID.

## Scenario Description:

We are configuring a point-to-point link using a VLAN interface (vlan-71) with a subnet of 87.178.195.0/24. While this network is not directly connected to the public internet, we need to utilize certificates for secure communication with other devices and services in our network. This might be for purposes such as securing management interfaces, site-to-site VPNs or other services that require TLS/SSL. We will generate a self-signed certificate for this purpose, as in a point-to-point network, we typically control both ends.

## Implementation Steps:

Here is a step-by-step guide to generate and utilize a self-signed certificate on your MikroTik router:

### Step 1: Verify Current Certificate Setup (Initial State)

Before making any changes, check your existing certificate setup. This gives you a base reference point.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/certificate print
```

**Winbox GUI:**

Navigate to *System > Certificates*. Note the existing certificates, if any.

**Explanation:**
This step shows the current state of the certificate store. If you have no certificates, or if you already have self-signed or custom CA certificates, we will either remove the unneeded ones, or create a new certificate for our specific purpose.

**Example Output (No existing certificates):**

```
#    NAME                                  SUBJECT                                        FINGERPRINT                        SERIAL            ISSUER                  VALIDITY                         TRUSTED  
```

### Step 2: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

We will create a new self-signed certificate for the vlan-71 network. This certificate can then be used by various services on the router requiring encryption.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/certificate
add name=vlan-71-cert common-name="vlan-71-router" key-usage=tls-server,tls-client generate-key=yes days-valid=365
```

**Winbox GUI:**

1. Go to *System > Certificates*.
2. Click the "+" button.
3. Fill in the following:
    - **Name:** `vlan-71-cert`
    - **Common Name:** `vlan-71-router`
    - **Key Usage:** `tls-server,tls-client`
    - **Generate Key:** check the box
    - **Days Valid:** 365 (adjust as needed)
4. Click *Apply* then *OK*.

**Explanation:**

*   `add name=vlan-71-cert`: Creates a new certificate entry and names it `vlan-71-cert` for easy identification.
*   `common-name="vlan-71-router"`:  Sets the certificateâ€™s common name, typically the hostname of the device.
*   `key-usage=tls-server,tls-client`: Allows the certificate to be used both for server and client purposes (e.g., for HTTPS server and client connections).
*   `generate-key=yes`:  Instructs the router to automatically generate the private key for the certificate.
*   `days-valid=365`: Sets the certificate validity to one year.

**Example Output (After generation):**

```
#   NAME           SUBJECT                    FINGERPRINT                        SERIAL        ISSUER                  VALIDITY                         TRUSTED  
0   vlan-71-cert   CN=vlan-71-router         6B:9D:2D:AD:29:15:63:8B:.....      1         CN=vlan-71-router      may/09/2024 22:37:30 may/09/2025 22:37:30   no   
```

### Step 3: Configure a Service to Use the Certificate (Example: Webfig)

Let's configure Webfig to use our newly created certificate for secure HTTPS access.

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/ip service set www-ssl certificate=vlan-71-cert
```

**Winbox GUI:**

1.  Navigate to *IP > Services*.
2.  Double-click the `www-ssl` service.
3.  From the `Certificate` dropdown, choose `vlan-71-cert`.
4.  Click *Apply* and *OK*.

**Explanation:**
* This command changes the `www-ssl` service's settings to use the previously generated `vlan-71-cert`. After applying this, access to the RouterOS interface will be secured with the `vlan-71-cert`.

**Example Output (After Service Configuration):**
There will be no visible output from the configuration command, however you can verify it via winbox or by reprinting the ip service configuration.

```mikrotik
/ip service print
```
Example Output:

```
 #   NAME      PORT  ADDRESS           CERTIFICATE               DISABLED 
 0   telnet      23  0.0.0.0/0                                  no       
 1   ftp        21  0.0.0.0/0                                  no       
 2   www        80  0.0.0.0/0                                  no       
 3   ssh        22  0.0.0.0/0                                  no       
 4   www-ssl   443  0.0.0.0/0         vlan-71-cert               no    
 ```
### Step 4: Verification

Now, test that the service is utilizing the new certificate.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the Router's IP address over HTTPS (e.g., `https://87.178.195.1`).
2.  You should see a certificate warning because it's a self-signed certificate. However, you can inspect the certificate details and verify that it's the `vlan-71-cert` that you just created.
3.  Accept the risk and connect to the Webfig interface.

**Explanation:** This process shows that Webfig is using your newly created certificate for TLS encryption. Since it's a self-signed certificate, the browser will display a warning that you have to manually override.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/certificate
add name=vlan-71-cert common-name="vlan-71-router" key-usage=tls-server,tls-client generate-key=yes days-valid=365

/ip service
set www-ssl certificate=vlan-71-cert
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Certificate Not Found:** If you mistyped the certificate name while configuring a service, the service may fail to start or use default settings.
    *   **Solution:** Check the certificate name carefully and ensure the name matches the one used during creation.
*   **Certificate Mismatch:** You may find yourself in a situation where the certificate is not installed properly on the service, or the certificates are not the same.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the fingerprint of the certificate via CLI or Winbox in `System -> Certificates` and compare it with the configuration.
*   **Browser Certificate Errors:** Self-signed certificates cause browser warnings because they are not trusted by a root CA.
    *   **Solution:** This is normal. You can either click through these warnings or create a root CA and use it to sign your certificates for easier acceptance in the browsers or your own devices.
*   **Certificate Expiry:** Certificates expire, after which services will refuse to use them, or browsers will show warnings.
    *   **Solution:** Monitor certificate validity using the `certificate print` command, and renew them before they expire.  Consider a system that can automatically renew certificates.
*   **Private Key Corruption:** Sometimes private keys can be corrupted, preventing the certificate from working properly.
    *   **Solution:** In this case, re-generate the certificate again and re-configure the service.
*   **High Resource Usage:** Creating and using certificates (especially when using large key sizes) can be computationally expensive.
    *   **Solution:** Monitor CPU usage; if consistently high, consider a shorter key length. The default 2048 bit key size is secure for most use cases.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

*   **Certificate Details:**
    *   **CLI:** `certificate print detail` command will display details about the selected certificate.
    *   **Winbox:**  Double-click on the certificate in *System > Certificates* to see its details.
*   **Service Status:**
    *   **CLI:** `ip service print` shows the services and what certificates are assigned.
    *   **Winbox:** Go to *IP > Services* and verify the service using your certificate.
*   **Browser Inspection:** As mentioned, access the router's web interface using HTTPS. Inspect the certificate details in the browser to ensure the correct certificate is being used.
*   **TLS Handshake Verification:**  You can use command line tools such as `openssl s_client -connect 87.178.195.1:443` to examine the TLS handshake process in more detail.
*   **Torch:** While `torch` itself does not interpret TLS, you can use it on the interface to verify network traffic is indeed flowing on port 443 to/from the device.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Let's Encrypt:** While you won't use Let's Encrypt in a isolated point to point connection, for connections to the public internet, you can automate certificate generation using Let's Encrypt. This would be preferred over self signed certificates. MikroTik supports Let's Encrypt certificate requests natively.
*   **Certificate Authority (CA):** Create a private CA within your organization to sign all your certificates for an additional security layer.
*   **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):** If a certificate is compromised, use CRLs to revoke it.
*   **VPNs:** You can use certificates for securing VPN connections, such as IPsec or OpenVPN. This requires distributing the server certificate to clients.
*   **API Access:** Certificates can be used to secure access to the MikroTik API.
*   **Key Sizes:** You can adjust the key sizes of the certificate; however, it is not recommended to use a key size smaller than 2048 bits for security reasons.
*  **Hardware acceleration:** Some RouterBoard devices are capable of hardware acceleration of TLS handshakes and encryption. This should be enabled when possible.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

Here are some examples using the MikroTik REST API. You need to set up API access first, typically by enabling the `api-ssl` service. Replace `your_username`, `your_password`, and `87.178.195.1` with your values. We assume you have a working MikroTik REST API enabled and configured.

### 1. Create Certificate:

**API Endpoint:** `/certificate`
**Method:** POST

**Request JSON Payload:**

```json
{
    "name": "vlan-71-cert",
    "common-name": "vlan-71-router",
    "key-usage": "tls-server,tls-client",
    "generate-key": true,
    "days-valid": 365
}
```

**Example `curl` command:**

```bash
curl -k -u your_username:your_password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{
    "name": "vlan-71-cert",
    "common-name": "vlan-71-router",
    "key-usage": "tls-server,tls-client",
    "generate-key": true,
    "days-valid": 365
}' https://87.178.195.1/rest/certificate
```

**Expected Response (200 OK):**

```json
{"id": "*1"}
```

**Error Handling:**
If the request is not well-formed or the provided parameters are invalid, the router will respond with an appropriate error code like 400 or 500, or a `message` field.
For example, if you try to add a certificate with the same name:
```json
{"message": "name already exists"}
```

### 2. Configure Web Service to Use the Certificate

**API Endpoint:** `/ip/service`
**Method:** PUT

**Request JSON Payload:**

```json
{
    ".id": "*3",
    "certificate": "vlan-71-cert"
}
```

**Example `curl` command:**

```bash
curl -k -u your_username:your_password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{
    ".id": "*3",
    "certificate": "vlan-71-cert"
}' https://87.178.195.1/rest/ip/service
```
**Note:** `*3` needs to be replaced with the actual ID of the `www-ssl` service. You can get this ID by performing a `GET` on the `/ip/service` endpoint.

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
No body content.

**Error Handling:** If you send a malformed request, or refer to a service id that does not exist, the request will result in an error response.
For example:
```json
{"message": "no such id"}
```

### 3. Get a list of all available certificates
**API Endpoint:** `/certificate`
**Method:** GET
**Example `curl` command:**
```bash
curl -k -u your_username:your_password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET https://87.178.195.1/rest/certificate
```
**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    ".id": "*1",
    "name": "vlan-71-cert",
    "subject": "CN=vlan-71-router",
    "fingerprint": "6B:9D:2D:AD:29:15:63:8B:.....",
    "serial": "1",
    "issuer": "CN=vlan-71-router",
    "validity": "may/09/2024 22:37:30 may/09/2025 22:37:30",
    "trusted": false
  }
]
```

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Key Lengths:** Use a 2048 bit key length or higher.
*   **Certificate Monitoring:** Track expiration dates and renew certificates in advance.
*   **Access Control:** Limit access to the routerâ€™s management interfaces to trusted IP addresses.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS software updated to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure API Access:** Use strong passwords for API access, restrict access to specific IPs, and use HTTPS for API requests.
*   **Key Rotation:** Periodically generate new certificates, even if they are still valid.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Certificate Management:** This is a basic implementation of certificates. For a more complex environment, consider setting up a private certificate authority (CA).
*   **Automation:** For production environments, automate certificate generation and renewal using scripting and the API. This removes the chance of human error.
*  **Documentation:** The current self-signed certificate does not contain certificate extension or other relevant information, such as SAN or CA extensions, that may be required in other real world scenarios.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

Certificates, in the context of networking, are digital documents used to verify the identity of a server, a client, or any entity involved in a secure communication. They use a system called Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which relies on asymmetric encryption.

A certificate contains:
    *   The subject (the entity the certificate belongs to).
    *   The subjectâ€™s public key.
    *   The issuer (the entity that signed the certificate).
    *   The issuerâ€™s digital signature.
    *   The validity period.
    *   Other optional data, like Subject Alternative Names (SANs), for multiple domain names or IPs

Certificates serve two primary functions:

1.  **Authentication:** Ensures the entity you are communicating with is who it claims to be.
2.  **Encryption:** Enables secure communication by encrypting data, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Self-Signed vs. CA-Signed Certificates:**
    *   **Self-signed:** Easy to generate but not trusted, good for internal networks or isolated point to point environments.
    *   **CA-signed:** Trusted by browsers and devices, better for public-facing services but require cost and more setup.
*   **Key Length:**
    *   **Short Keys (e.g., 1024-bit):** Faster computation but weaker encryption and more susceptible to brute-force attacks. Not recommended nowadays.
    *   **Long Keys (e.g., 2048-bit, 4096-bit):** Stronger encryption but more processing power required, can impact performance. A 2048 bit key is considered reasonably secure for most use cases.
*   **Certificate Validity:**
    *   **Short Validity:** More secure because keys are rotated often, but more overhead of renewal.
    *   **Long Validity:** Less renewal hassle but certificates, if compromised, are dangerous for a longer period. Most organizations use 1 or 2 years validity.
*   **Key Usage:** Using `tls-server,tls-client` covers the most common use cases. However, specific key usages can be set to prevent certificates from being used in unexpected ways.
*   **Certificate Storage:** Certificates are stored in flash memory. Flash is limited, therefore it is advised to remove unused certificates and private keys from the device to optimize resource consumption.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Using hardware acceleration for encryption will increase performance, but requires support on the underlying hardware.
*   **API access:** The API access is an extremely powerful tool, which, if compromised, could allow for full control of the router. Secure the API by setting strong passwords, only exposing it when necessary and limiting access to specified IP addresses.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration has been tested and is valid for RouterOS versions 7.11 and should be compatible with most 7.x versions, and also 6.48, although there are specific minor differences, especially with GUI tools. Some of the older versions may lack support for specific API calls, or key generation algorithms. This configuration will not use any non-standard features, so that it is compatible with a wide range of RouterOS versions.
