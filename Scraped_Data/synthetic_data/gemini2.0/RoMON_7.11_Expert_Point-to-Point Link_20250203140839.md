Okay, let's craft some expert-level documentation on RoMON for MikroTik RouterOS, tailored to your specifications.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) on a MikroTik router that participates in a point-to-point link. The goal is to enable centralized management and discovery of other MikroTik devices on the same link without relying on IP reachability. This is particularly useful in scenarios where devices may not have routable IP addresses or when you need a reliable discovery mechanism independent of network layers. Specifically, RoMON will be enabled on interface `vlan-69`, which is part of the 11.130.89.0/24 subnet.

## Implementation Steps:

**Assumptions:**

*   We have an active VLAN interface `vlan-69` configured.
*   This router already participates in the point-to-point link.
*   Basic understanding of MikroTik CLI and Winbox is assumed.

1.  **Step 1: Enable RoMON on the Router**

    *   **Before:** The default RoMON settings are likely disabled.
    *   **Action:** Enable RoMON globally. This step is performed once on the router.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon set enabled=yes
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Tools` -> `RoMON` and check the `Enabled` box.
    *   **Explanation:** This command activates the RoMON service on the router. Without enabling it globally, no RoMON communication is possible.
    *   **After:** RoMON service is now active, but not yet associated with any specific interfaces.

2.  **Step 2: Enable RoMON on the Target Interface**

    *   **Before:** RoMON is enabled globally, but the target interface `vlan-69` is not yet using the RoMON service.
    *   **Action:** Enable RoMON on the `vlan-69` interface.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface romon-port add interface=vlan-69
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Tools` -> `RoMON` -> `Ports`. Click the `+` to add a new interface, and select the `vlan-69` interface.
    *   **Explanation:** This command creates a RoMON port entry for the specified interface. This allows RoMON communication to occur over `vlan-69`.
    *   **After:** RoMON is enabled on interface `vlan-69`. This now listens for RoMON packets on that interface and will begin responding with RoMON advertisements on this interface.

3.  **Step 3: (Optional) Set a Secret Key**

    *   **Before:** RoMON traffic is not encrypted or authenticated, it will announce itself to anyone listening.
    *   **Action:** Set a shared secret key for RoMON authentication and encryption.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon set secret="your_strong_secret_key"
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Tools` -> `RoMON`, find the `Secret` field, and set the shared secret.
    *   **Explanation:** RoMON by default doesn't use any kind of authentication or encryption. This command will add an authentication secret, and also provide encryption for RoMON traffic. All other routers in the RoMON domain must share the same secret for communication.
    *   **After:** RoMON communication is secured with the shared secret.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/tool romon
set enabled=yes secret="your_strong_secret_key"

/interface romon-port
add interface=vlan-69
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

| Command             | Parameter    | Value                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/tool romon set`  | `enabled`    | `yes`                         | Enables the RoMON service globally.                                                                                                     |
| `/tool romon set`  | `secret`     | `"your_strong_secret_key"`     | Sets the shared secret key for RoMON traffic authentication and encryption, this should be unique and strong.  (Optional but highly recommended) |
| `/interface romon-port add` | `interface` | `vlan-69`                    | Specifies the interface over which RoMON communication will take place.                                                               |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** RoMON devices not being discovered.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure RoMON is enabled on *both* devices on the interface, the main router and the RoMON client you wish to manage.
        *   Verify the interface is correctly specified (`vlan-69`).
        *   Check if the secret key matches *exactly* on all devices.
        *   Use `/tool romon monitor` on both devices to check if they are detecting each other's advertisements.
        *   Use `/interface romon-port monitor` to make sure the correct interfaces are listed.
*   **Problem:** High CPU usage with many RoMON devices.
    *   **Solution:** Limit the number of RoMON enabled interfaces and devices that connect to the main RoMON router. Try to limit the size of your RoMON network. RoMON is designed to operate on smaller, controlled networks.
*   **Problem:** Missing Secret
     *   **Solution:** RoMON with no encryption or authentication is not secure. Ensure you add a shared secret, this will increase the security of your network.
*   **Problem:** Duplicate RoMON IDs.
    *   **Solution:** RoMON uses a unique ID generated by the router. If two routers somehow generate the same ID, RoMON might not work as expected. Check `System -> Identity` on the conflicting routers and rename one of them.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Verify RoMON Status on Each Device:**

    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool romon print
        ```
        Look for `enabled=yes`.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface romon-port print
        ```
        Make sure that the interface `vlan-69` is present.
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Tools` -> `RoMON`. Verify that `Enabled` is checked and the `Secret` is correct. Also verify that the `vlan-69` is listed under `Ports`.
2.  **Monitor RoMON Connections:**

    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
         /tool romon monitor
        ```
        This will show a list of connected devices (or `empty` if none detected), including IDs and other information about your RoMON network. Check the output of this command to verify if you can see your other devices, and check your neighbor devices are showing with the correct IP and MAC addresses.
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Go to `Tools` -> `RoMON`, there is a tab for `Monitor` that does the same action.
3.  **Test Connectivity (via Winbox/Webfig/SSH)**

    *   In Winbox or Webfig, in the `Connect To` field you can enter the RoMON ID you wish to connect to, rather than using IP address. You will first need to use `/tool romon monitor` to get the RoMON ID of the device, and then you can copy that into the connect box. This method of connection shows a functional RoMON network.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Neighbor Discovery:** RoMON is independent of IP addresses and layers, making it an alternative to standard neighbor discovery protocols. If you are struggling with dynamic neighbor discovery, RoMON may be a good alternative.
*   **Centralized Management:** Using Winbox or other management tools, you can connect to remote MikroTik devices using their RoMON ID instead of IP addresses. This also provides the benefit of being able to manage devices even if they have no IP address. This is useful for configuration management and support.
*   **Layer 2 Isolation:** While RoMON is layer 2 focused, it is not dependent on VLAN tagging. This is beneficial as it means it's not dependent on correct Layer 2 configuration.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

RoMON functionality is not yet fully exposed in the REST API. Therefore, we'll focus on how to get the current status and enable it.

**Enabling RoMON:**
*   **API Endpoint**: `/tool/romon`
*   **Request Method**: `PUT`
*   **Example JSON Payload**:

   ```json
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "secret": "your_strong_secret_key"
   }
   ```

*   **Expected Response**:
    A successful PUT request should return an HTTP 200 code, or an error depending on the situation. There will be no data returned.
* **Example curl command**

    ```bash
    curl -k -u "api-username:api-password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT \
        -d '{ "enabled": true, "secret": "your_strong_secret_key"}' \
         https://192.168.88.1/rest/tool/romon
    ```

**Adding a RoMON port**
*   **API Endpoint**: `/interface/romon-port`
*   **Request Method**: `POST`
*   **Example JSON Payload**:

    ```json
        {
            "interface": "vlan-69"
        }
    ```

*   **Expected Response**:
    A successful POST request should return an HTTP 201 code, the new romon-port id, and properties
* **Example curl command**

    ```bash
    curl -k -u "api-username:api-password" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "interface": "vlan-69"}' \
        https://192.168.88.1/rest/interface/romon-port
    ```
*  **Handling API errors:**
    * The API returns an HTTP error code and a JSON formatted error message. You must read the error message to understand the reason for the failure.
    * Examples of errors: Incorrect API user or password, incorrect JSON payload, other system related errors.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Use a strong secret key:** This prevents unauthorized devices from joining the RoMON network. Choose a strong and unique secret for each RoMON domain.
*   **Limit interface use:** Enable RoMON only on interfaces that absolutely require it. Avoid unnecessary broadcasts.
*   **Monitor RoMON traffic:** Pay attention to the `/tool romon monitor` output for any unexpected devices.
*  **Monitor your authentication errors:** Your log file may indicate authentication failures, which could be a sign that your password has been compromised.
*   **Regularly update RouterOS:** Keep RouterOS updated to patch vulnerabilities that may affect RoMON.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Improvement:** In a large environment, consider segmenting RoMON into smaller, manageable domains. This will allow for better control of discovery and broadcasts.
*   **Improvement:** Always use a secret on all of your RoMON domains, it's better to be safe than sorry.
*   **Improvement:** Create documentation describing the secrets, and keep the secrets stored securely.
*   **Improvement:** Script the configuration to ensure consistency across multiple devices.
*   **Improvement:** Add more detailed troubleshooting steps for specific errors, such as checking firewall rules.
*   **Improvement:** Provide a detailed description of RoMON security including potential attack vectors.
*   **Improvement:** Provide a detailed example of real world environments where RoMON is useful.
*  **Improvement:** Add a section for disabling RoMON.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

RoMON is a MikroTik proprietary protocol for layer 2 network management and discovery. It provides an out-of-band management channel that does not rely on IP connectivity or higher layer protocols. The primary goal of RoMON is to make it possible to discover and manage MikroTik devices that are not directly IP-reachable.

Here's a breakdown of its key features:

*   **Layer 2 Protocol:** RoMON operates at layer 2 of the OSI model, meaning it does not require IP addressing. This makes it incredibly useful in scenarios where devices do not yet have IP addresses configured, or cannot be routed.
*   **Discovery:** RoMON allows MikroTik routers to discover each other through layer 2 broadcast and multicast messages. This is how routers can discover and list other MikroTik routers using the `tool romon monitor` command.
*   **Management:** With RoMON, management tools (like Winbox and Webfig) can connect to remote devices using their RoMON ID, bypassing IP reachability requirements.
*   **Encryption (with Secret):** You can encrypt and authenticate RoMON traffic using a shared secret key, ensuring that only authorized devices can participate in the RoMON network.
*   **Out-of-Band:** RoMON provides an out-of-band communication channel, which means it is independent of your normal network and traffic. This can be helpful when troubleshooting network issues, and can provide a reliable method of network access if your IP network goes down.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Performance Impact:** While RoMON is generally lightweight, it may introduce a small overhead on your network, particularly with a high number of active interfaces. This can be mitigated by only enabling it on essential interfaces. You can use the command `/tool profile` to determine the exact performance impact of RoMON.
*   **Security:** By not enabling a secret on your RoMON network, you leave yourself open to potentially malicious actors. You must use a strong shared secret to protect the RoMON network.
*   **Complexity:** Setting up RoMON can add a layer of complexity to your network. Consider if the added benefit outways the additional overhead in your specific case. If you're running a network with very basic requirements, it may not be worth enabling RoMON.
*   **Management Tools:** While RoMON allows using Winbox and Webfig to connect, not every tool has implemented RoMON support. You may need to rely on IP access if your specific tool does not have RoMON support.
*   **Compatibility:** Not all devices support RoMON. Make sure your devices are capable of running it.
*   **Scalability:** RoMON works best on small, controlled networks. It was not designed for larger, more complex networks. You must use smaller RoMON domains to ensure the service works effectively.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The commands and configurations described here are applicable to RouterOS 7.11 and later. There may be differences with older versions, specifically before RouterOS v7. You should consult the MikroTik documentation for older routerOS versions.
