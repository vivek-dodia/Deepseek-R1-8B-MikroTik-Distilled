Hello,I am using a hEX as CAPsMAN und 2 hAPs + 1wAP as access points controlled by the CAPsMAN. The wireless lan exists, I can connect everytime I need to but sometimes I have very poor transfer rates via wireless lan. One hour later everything seems to be perfect again and so on.I analyzed different things during the last weeks. I have no errors or drops on any interfaces, the ROS is the latest version 4.62.6 on every device.I recognized that my caps are reconnecting in different intervals. The interval is not a specific time I can reproduce. Sometimes it takes some minutes, some hours or a CAP is re-connecting after one day or more. The intervals are all different and seem more random on all CAPs. The CAPs don't re-connect all at the same time. Every CAP seems to re-connect as he likes to.Today I recognized some timeouts during the re-connect of a CAP to the CAPsMAN in the log of the CAP:I also tried to isolate the problem. I disconnected everything from the lan instead of the hEX and one hAP, the problem resides. I also disconnected the dsl modem of my provider for a specific time and the two left devices showed the same phenomenon.If I disable RSTP and set the protocol to "none" the CAPs don't re-connect anymore and everything seems to be ok. The transfer-rates are good everytime.Every CAP can ping the CAPsMAN, default Gateway is set correctly, DNS servers are set, the connection for every CAP to the internet ist perfect. There is no problem reaching any device on the network. The mentioned problem exists If we are surfing on the internet or if we are streaming and the CAPs are also re-connecting if no one is at home.I don't really know what else to analyze. The are no hints where to look at next.Do you have any suggestions? If you need some more informations about my configuration please ask for it.Regards,Jens

I solved the problem. The CAPsMAN needed to be restarted by hard powering off and on again.After this procedure everything is ok and my CPAS don't disconnect any more with RSTP activated.

The problem I encountered is similar to yours, my solution is cap--bridge--Ports--remove wlan1

I had the same problem till yesterday. I had no wlan in bridge, I even had not any bridge. I fixed it changing two things in each CAP:x.x.x.x is my CapsMAN's IPIt change the connection between CAP and CapsMAN from L2 to L3. You will see it in Winbox Capsman->Remote CAP. In the first column should be an IP address not MAC address. No more "CAP sent max keepalives without response" and it is stable. I hope it help.

I also had a similar problem with the message in LOG: "CAP sent max keepalives without response."  When running CAP and CAPsMAN on the same device, in my case on RB4011, you have to open packets from CAP to CAPsMAN on the firewall!!!/ip firewall filter add action=accept chain=input comment="CAP to CAPsMAN" dst-port=5246,5247 protocol=udp src-address=192.168.0.1 /IP address of CAP/

```
Code:Select all/ip firewall filteraddchain=input action=accept dst-address=127.0.0.1comment="defconf: accept to local loopback (for CAPsMAN)"
```

This is one of default firewall filter rules, present in SOHO line in 6.47.9:

I just got this situation on one location17:53:33 caps,info CAP connect to CapsMan1 (11:11:11:11:A2:8F/11/0) failed: timeout17:53:33 caps,info CAP failed to join CapsMan1 (11:11:11:11:A2:8F/11/0)17:53:33 caps,info CAP selected CAPsMAN CapsMan1 (::ffff:10.11.12.1:5246)17:53:33 caps,info CAP connected to CapsMan1 (::ffff:10.11.12.1:5246), CommonName 'CAPsMAN-71111111A28F'17:53:33 caps,info CAP joined CapsMan1 (::ffff:10.11.12.1:5246)17:54:01 caps,info CAP disconnected from CapsMan1 (::ffff:10.11.12.1:5246)17:54:04 caps,info CAP selected CAPsMAN CapsMan1 (11:11:11:11:A2:8F/11/0)17:54:24 caps,info CAP connect to CapsMan1 (11:11:11:11:A2:8F/11/0) failed: timeout17:54:24 caps,info CAP failed to join CapsMan1 (11:11:11:11:A2:8F/11/0)17:54:24 caps,info CAP selected CAPsMAN CapsMan1 (::ffff:10.11.12.1:5246)... and so on, for hours and hours on CAP, while the log was full reconections of that CAP on CapsMan!Fist, restart did not help,Second  changing the discovery interface did not help,Third the firewall was permissive, so that did not help also.Then I tried removing some interfaces from bridge. I realized I can not remove any interface from bridge. Hmmm.... funny thing.Well, then it shined on me, Bridge1 was populated using option "any",  and therefore, all the entries were dynamic!Furthermore, I realized the router next to this one was reporting:18:41:17 interface,warning ether1: bridge RX looped packet - MAC b:fb:05 -> 11:11:11:11:a2:8f ETHERTYPE 0x0800 IP UDP 10.11.12.15:53005 -> 10.11.12.1:5247The bridge was causing all of it! Deleted the "any" option in bridge, populated list of interfaces as it should be, and the thing works as it should!If this happens to you, check the bridge setup.P.S. some IP/MAC addresses were changed in quotes.
