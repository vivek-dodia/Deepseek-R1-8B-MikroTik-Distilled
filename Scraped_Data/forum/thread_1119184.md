I've got a brand new RB4011iGS+RM with 7.10.1 firmware (according to Winbox).I try to log into it, using the User and Password that are on the label on the router and I get the "ERROR: wrong username or password".I've factory reset this router and I still get this error.Any suggestions?John Rayfield, Jr.

admin without any password also not working?send the serial number to the seller and ask for the password from their database, or you can email mikrotik for the same. Just in case sticker is wrong or something

Thanks for the quick response.I found that an 'O' in the password on the label, looked like a '0'.  I tried 'O' and it worked.John

Hi all,unfortunately I have not this luck with mixed letter in password. But I struggle on exactly the same, wrong password, which is on sticker with brand new device. I've tried to reset RB to its defauls, but no change. Here is also its S/N = HFK09G4MNAV /r2. By simple connecting routers seems to work well and I am able to connect to internet. But no way on follow up on further configurations.Any idea?Thank you

I have the same issue with a brand new RB5009. This is not what i was expected. I've preferred the old way with no password, Its the users responsibility to secure their device. Other systems also come with default user/pass.
