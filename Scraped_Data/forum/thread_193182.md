Is there a way to access the device over USB port via serial adapter or something??I get where your coming from – want to get in if the router is FUBAR...But winbox's MAC-address / layer2 access is a godsend to avoid needing a serial port to access the router if you're at the physical router.  If you enable RoMON, Layer2 access get extended to other routers using an alternative switching plane.I don't have any handy, but I'd image a USB to serial adapter work if it showed up under /port... Then it could be assigned to console in /system/console – before you'd needed for an "emergency".  Just plugging in the serial-to-USB is likely going to do nothing since RouterOS wants you to assign the port to some service, of which console is one possibility.

you can connect any USB-RS232 and use it as console in /system ports if you have USB-HUB also you can connect many USBs devices and configure it as you like we was use it for UPS and GSM devices etc.also there is Quad/Octa Serial ports you can connected it Router OS almost support all serial chips and in market FDS chip its available.like thishttps://www.usbgear.com/USB2-8COM-M.html
