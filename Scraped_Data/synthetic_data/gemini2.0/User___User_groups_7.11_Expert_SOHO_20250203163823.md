Okay, let's craft a comprehensive MikroTik RouterOS expert-level documentation for user and user group management within the specified context.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario focuses on implementing user and user group management on a MikroTik router in a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) environment. We will configure users with specific permissions using user groups, which will be relevant if needing to grant access to various router features to different users with different roles. Our specific configuration will be based on a subnet `60.13.70.0/24` and will logically represent devices connected to a network attached to bridge interface `bridge-55`.

## Implementation Steps:

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide, using both CLI and Winbox, to configure user and user group management, along with the reasoning behind each step:

**1. Initial State**
   *  Before any changes we assume that we have a basic MikroTik configuration with a bridge `bridge-55` in place. We will verify this.
   *  **CLI**
     ```mikrotik
     /interface bridge print
     ```
     * **Expected Output:** We expect to see an active interface with name `bridge-55`. For example:
     ```
      Flags: X - disabled, R - running
      0  R name="bridge-55" mtu=1500 actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=65535 arp=enabled
           mac-address=D4:CA:6D:12:34:56 protocol-mode=none priority=0x8000
           auto-mac=yes admin-mac=00:00:00:00:00:00 max-message-age=20s
           forward-delay=15s transmit-hold-count=6
     ```

**2. Create a User Group:**

   *  First, we will create a user group, named `monitor-group`, and give it read-only permissions. This is beneficial for granting access to view router statistics without risking changes to the configuration.
   * **CLI**
     ```mikrotik
     /user group add name=monitor-group policy=read
     ```
   * **Winbox GUI:**
      1. Go to **System** -> **Users** -> **Groups**.
      2. Click **"+"** to add a new group.
      3.  Enter `monitor-group` in the `Name` field.
      4. Check only the `read` checkbox in the **Policies** list.
      5. Click **Apply** then **OK**.
   * **After Configuration:**
     *  **CLI**
       ```mikrotik
       /user group print
       ```
       * **Expected Output:**
         ```
         #   NAME           POLICY
         0   monitor-group  read
         ```

**3. Create a User:**

   * Now, we'll create a user named `monitor-user` and assign them to the `monitor-group` we just created. The user will be given a password `testpass` that needs to be changed.
   * **CLI**
     ```mikrotik
     /user add name=monitor-user group=monitor-group password=testpass
     ```
   * **Winbox GUI:**
      1. Go to **System** -> **Users**.
      2. Click **"+"** to add a new user.
      3.  Enter `monitor-user` in the `Name` field.
      4. Select `monitor-group` in the **Group** dropdown.
      5.  Enter `testpass` in the **Password** field and confirm it in the **Confirm Password** field.
      6. Click **Apply** then **OK**.

  * **After Configuration:**
     *  **CLI**
       ```mikrotik
       /user print
       ```
       * **Expected Output:**
         ```
         #   NAME        GROUPS        DISABLED
         0   admin       full          no
         1   monitor-user  monitor-group no
         ```
    * The user `monitor-user` is now created and part of `monitor-group`

**4. Create another User Group:**
   * This time, create a user group `admin-group` with full access. This group will be assigned to more administrative users in the future
   * **CLI**
     ```mikrotik
     /user group add name=admin-group policy=full
     ```
   * **Winbox GUI:**
      1. Go to **System** -> **Users** -> **Groups**.
      2. Click **"+"** to add a new group.
      3.  Enter `admin-group` in the `Name` field.
      4. Check all checkboxes in the **Policies** list.
      5. Click **Apply** then **OK**.

   * **After Configuration:**
      * **CLI**
        ```mikrotik
        /user group print
        ```
        * **Expected Output:**
          ```
          #   NAME           POLICY
          0   monitor-group  read
          1   admin-group    full
          ```
   * Now we have two user groups

**5. Create an administrative User:**

   * Create an administrative user with full access named `admin-user`.
   * **CLI**
     ```mikrotik
     /user add name=admin-user group=admin-group password=adminpass
     ```
   * **Winbox GUI:**
      1. Go to **System** -> **Users**.
      2. Click **"+"** to add a new user.
      3.  Enter `admin-user` in the `Name` field.
      4. Select `admin-group` in the **Group** dropdown.
      5.  Enter `adminpass` in the **Password** field and confirm it in the **Confirm Password** field.
      6. Click **Apply** then **OK**.

   * **After Configuration:**
     *  **CLI**
       ```mikrotik
       /user print
       ```
       * **Expected Output:**
         ```
         #   NAME        GROUPS        DISABLED
         0   admin       full          no
         1   monitor-user  monitor-group no
         2   admin-user  admin-group   no
         ```
   * We have now completed our user and user groups configuration, and we can connect with the `monitor-user` with `read` permissions, and `admin-user` with full access.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the complete set of MikroTik CLI commands for this setup:

```mikrotik
/user group
add name=monitor-group policy=read
add name=admin-group policy=full
/user
add name=monitor-user group=monitor-group password=testpass
add name=admin-user group=admin-group password=adminpass
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

| Command            | Parameter    | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/user group add`   | `name`       | The name of the user group (e.g., `monitor-group`).                     |
|                    | `policy`     | The access permissions granted to users within the group (e.g., `read`, `full`). |
| `/user add`        | `name`       | The username for the user (e.g., `monitor-user`).                         |
|                    | `group`      | The user group the user is assigned to (e.g., `monitor-group`).          |
|                    | `password`   | The password for the user.                                              |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

* **Password Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Forgetting passwords.
    *   **Solution:**  Use strong passwords and a password manager or reset passwords via the command line if needed. Also make sure that the password reset has been previously enabled.
    * **MikroTik CLI Command** to change password:
        ```mikrotik
        /user set monitor-user password=newpassword
        ```
*   **Permission Errors:**
    *   **Problem:**  Users in `monitor-group` are unable to view resources.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the `policy` is correctly set for the user group. Use the command `user group print` to verify the `policy`.
* **Typographical Errors:**
    * **Problem:** Misspelling user or group names
    * **Solution:** Double check all user and group names during creation and assignment.
*   **Unintended Full Access:**
    *   **Problem:** Accidentally assigning a user to the `full` policy group.
    *   **Solution:** Regularly audit user group memberships. Use the command `/user print` to see group assignments, and the command `user group print` to verify group permissions.
* **Security Vulnerability:**
    * **Problem:** Using a default username and password can leave your MikroTik router vulnerable.
    * **Solution:**  Never use default `admin` username and default password. Always create users with limited access, and only allow administrative access to dedicated administrators.
*   **Resource Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Many users logging in or running intensive commands leading to high CPU or memory usage.
    *   **Solution:** Limit concurrent sessions or manage user login times. Use RouterOS' built-in monitoring tools (`/system resource print`) to check system load, and implement resource management practices.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1. **Login Verification:**
   * Attempt to log into the router with both the `monitor-user` and `admin-user` credentials using SSH, Telnet, or Winbox. The `monitor-user` should only have access to view configuration. The `admin-user` should have full access.
2. **Permission Verification:**
  * Log in with `monitor-user` and try to change something.  Attempting to add new entries in `IP -> Firewall` should be restricted.
  * Attempt the same action with `admin-user` to verify that it has `full` access, and is able to make changes.
3. **Command Verification:**
   *  **CLI** Log in with `monitor-user`, and try `/system user add name=testuser`.
   *   **Expected Result:** Permission denied.
    *  Log in with `admin-user`, and try `/system user add name=testuser`.
    *  **Expected Result:** The user `testuser` is created.

## Related Features and Considerations:

* **RADIUS Authentication:** Use RADIUS for centralized authentication and authorization.
* **User Profiles:** Create profiles with specific limitations like login times.
* **Remote Access:** Use secure methods such as SSH and HTTPS for remote administration.
* **User Logging:** Enable logging to track user actions for security purposes.
* **API Access Control:** Limit API access based on user groups.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Here's how to manage user groups using MikroTik's REST API:

**1. Create a User Group (monitor-group)**

* **API Endpoint:** `/user/group`
* **Request Method:** POST
* **Request Payload (JSON):**
```json
{
  "name": "monitor-group",
  "policy": "read"
}
```
* **Expected Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
    ".id": "*1",
    "name": "monitor-group",
    "policy": "read"
}
```
**2. Create a User (monitor-user)**
* **API Endpoint:** `/user`
* **Request Method:** POST
* **Request Payload (JSON):**
```json
{
  "name": "monitor-user",
  "group": "monitor-group",
  "password": "testpass"
}
```
* **Expected Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  ".id": "*2",
  "name": "monitor-user",
  "group": "monitor-group",
  "disabled": false
}
```
**3. Error Handling (Invalid User Group):**
* **Request Payload (JSON):**
```json
{
  "name": "testuser",
  "group": "non-existent-group",
  "password": "testpass"
}
```
* **Expected Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
    "message": "invalid value for argument 'group'"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies for all users.
*   **Least Privilege:** Assign users the least necessary permissions to perform their job.
*   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review user group memberships and permissions.
*   **Secure Access:** Only use encrypted protocols for remote access (SSH, HTTPS).
*   **Disable Default Users:** Disable or rename the default `admin` user.
*   **Logging:** Enable and monitor user logs for suspicious activities.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides a good starting point for user management. Here are potential areas for improvement:

*   **Fine-grained Permissions:** Explore more specific policy options beyond `read` and `full` if needed (e.g., `write`, `test`).
*   **Session Management:** Implement more robust session management, especially if dealing with remote access.
*   **Centralized User Management:** Integrate RADIUS for easier user management at scale, or even use a central LDAP service.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Add another layer of security with 2FA where applicable.
*  **Automated User Setup:** Use scripting to create new users and user groups to speed up operations when more than a couple of users are needed.
*   **Password Rotation:** Establish a policy for password rotation for increased security.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

MikroTik user and user group management involves controlling access to router resources and functionality. Users are assigned to groups, and each group has an associated policy that dictates permissions. This feature is essential for:

* **Access Control:** Restricting access to the router based on roles and responsibilities.
* **Security:** Limiting exposure by preventing unauthorized access.
* **Administration:** Simplifying management by grouping users with similar needs.
* **Auditing:** Tracking user activities for accountability.
* **Delegating Responsibilities:** By allowing a team to access the router with different permissions.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Single User vs. User Groups:**
    *   **Single User:** Easier to setup for a very small deployment but hard to maintain if needs change.
    *   **User Groups:** More flexible and organized, especially with multiple users and different permission levels. More work to setup upfront, but saves time down the road.
*   **`read` vs. `full` vs. other policy options:**
    *   **`read`:** Limits users to viewing configuration and stats. This is useful for monitoring or reporting only users, and minimizes risk.
    *   **`full`:** Grants all permissions, which should be reserved for trusted administrators. High risk if misused.
    *   **Other policy options:** Offers fine-grained control to grant specific sets of permissions, such as `write` or `test`, but will make administration a bit more complex.
*   **Local vs. Remote Access:**
    *   **Local:** Typically, access is directly from the LAN, more secure, but less convenient
    *   **Remote:** Requires additional security measures like strong authentication, encrypted connections (SSH), and perhaps VPN. Convenient, but potentially risky.
*   **RADIUS/LDAP vs. Local Users:**
   *   **Local Users:** Easier for small networks, but less scalable and harder to manage when dealing with large amounts of users.
   *   **RADIUS/LDAP:** More secure and scalable, offering centralized user management, but more complex to set up initially.
