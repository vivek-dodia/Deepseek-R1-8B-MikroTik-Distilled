Okay, let's dive deep into configuring a MikroTik RouterOS device for a hotspot network, focusing on the specific subnet (80.161.205.0/24) and interface (vlan-25). This is going to be a comprehensive guide covering many aspects of MikroTik RouterOS.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** We are setting up a hotspot network for a small-to-medium business (SMB). This requires proper IP addressing, VLAN configuration, user authentication, and security measures. The router will be connected to the internet via a primary interface (e.g., `ether1`) and will handle traffic for the hotspot users on VLAN 25 (`vlan-25`). We'll use a pool of IP addresses within the specified subnet.
*   **Specific Requirements:**
    *   Subnet: 80.161.205.0/24
    *   VLAN ID: 25
    *   Interface Name for VLAN: `vlan-25`
    *   Hotspot functionality including user management and authentication.
    *   Basic firewall rules to protect the network.
    *   Considerations for future IPv6 implementation.
    *   Explanation of L3 Hardware offloading features available on the router,
    *   High availability configuration using VRRP if applicable.
    *   Use of IP services such as DHCP and DNS

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)**

**2.1.  Using the MikroTik CLI**

    *   **Step 1: Configure the VLAN Interface:**
        *   Create the VLAN interface on an existing physical interface (e.g., `ether2`):
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan
        add name=vlan-25 vlan-id=25 interface=ether2
        ```
        *   **Explanation:**
            *   `/interface vlan` - Accesses the VLAN interface configuration.
            *   `add name=vlan-25 vlan-id=25 interface=ether2` - Creates a new VLAN interface named `vlan-25`, assigns VLAN ID 25, and associates it with physical interface `ether2`.
    *   **Step 2: Assign IP Address to the VLAN Interface:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address
        add address=80.161.205.1/24 interface=vlan-25
        ```
        *   **Explanation:**
            *   `/ip address` - Accesses the IP address configuration.
            *   `add address=80.161.205.1/24 interface=vlan-25` - Assigns the IP address 80.161.205.1 with a /24 subnet mask to the `vlan-25` interface. This serves as the gateway for the subnet.
    *   **Step 3: Create an IP Pool for Hotspot Users:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip pool
        add name=hotspot-pool ranges=80.161.205.2-80.161.205.254
        ```
        *   **Explanation:**
            *   `/ip pool` - Accesses the IP pool configuration.
            *   `add name=hotspot-pool ranges=80.161.205.2-80.161.205.254` - Defines a range of IP addresses within the subnet for dynamic allocation to hotspot users.
    *   **Step 4: Configure DHCP Server for the VLAN:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server
        add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=vlan-25 lease-time=10m name=dhcp-vlan-25
        /ip dhcp-server network
        add address=80.161.205.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=80.161.205.1
        ```
        *  **Explanation:**
           *   `/ip dhcp-server` - Accesses the DHCP server configuration.
           *   `add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=vlan-25 lease-time=10m name=dhcp-vlan-25` - Creates a DHCP server named dhcp-vlan-25, which assigns IP addresses from hotspot-pool on vlan-25 interface with a 10-minute lease time.
            *   `/ip dhcp-server network` - Accesses DHCP network configuration.
            *   `add address=80.161.205.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=80.161.205.1` - Configure network settings.
    *   **Step 5: Enable and Configure Hotspot server:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip hotspot profile
        add name=hsprof-vlan-25 html-directory=hotspot hotspot-address=80.161.205.1 login-by=http-chap,cookie
        /ip hotspot
        add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=vlan-25 name=hotspot-vlan-25 profile=hsprof-vlan-25
        /ip hotspot user profile
        add name=hspot-user-profile shared-users=1
        /ip hotspot user add name=testuser password=testpass profile=hspot-user-profile
        ```
        *   **Explanation:**
            *   `/ip hotspot profile` - Accesses the hotspot profile configuration
            *   `add name=hsprof-vlan-25 html-directory=hotspot hotspot-address=80.161.205.1 login-by=http-chap,cookie` - Creates a hotspot profile for users of the hotspot and specifies login methods, it points to html-directory in the router's file storage for customised webpage.
            *   `/ip hotspot` - Accesses the hotspot server configuration
            *   `add address-pool=hotspot-pool interface=vlan-25 name=hotspot-vlan-25 profile=hsprof-vlan-25` - Creates a hotspot server for the vlan-25 interface
            *    `/ip hotspot user profile` - Accesses the hotspot user profile configuration
            *   `add name=hspot-user-profile shared-users=1` - Creates a user profile with 1 concurrent connection allowed.
             *  `/ip hotspot user` - Accesses the hotspot user configuration
            *   `add name=testuser password=testpass profile=hspot-user-profile` - Creates a user named `testuser` with password `testpass` using the `hspot-user-profile`.
     *   **Step 6: Configure Firewall rules**:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip firewall nat
        add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
        /ip firewall filter
        add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related
        add chain=forward action=drop connection-state=invalid
        add chain=forward action=accept in-interface=vlan-25
        add chain=forward action=drop in-interface=ether1
        ```
        *  **Explanation:**
            *   `/ip firewall nat` - Accesses the firewall NAT configuration.
            *   `add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade` - Creates a source NAT rule for masquerading connections from the local network behind the router's public IP on interface `ether1`.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **Bridging and Switching:**
    *   MikroTik allows for bridging interfaces (layer 2) and configuring VLANs within a bridge. This is useful for more complex network topologies. In the case of this example, the vlan interface was created at the interface level. The vlan can also be configured on the bridging level, which could be an alternative solution.
*   **IP Settings:** MikroTik offers advanced IP settings like ARP modes, ICMP settings, TCP flags, and more. This can be used to fine-tune IP stack behaviours.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:** MikroTik RouterOS supports L3 Hardware offloading when a switch chip is available on the device. This feature offloads IP packet forwarding and other tasks to the switch chip instead of relying on CPU usage, providing better performance for specific routing, NAT or firewall tasks. Can be configured within the `switch` menu.
*   **MACVLAN:** Create virtual interfaces with unique MAC addresses on existing physical interfaces for separation. This is useful in specific use cases such as container networking.
*  **MACsec**: (Media Access Control Security) enables the encryption and authentication of data at the Media Access Control level, providing secure communication between two MACsec enabled devices.
*   **VXLAN:** Create virtual Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 to extend LAN segments across IP networks.
*   **IP Pools:** Allows fine-grained control of IP address allocations. Different pools can be created for various uses.
*   **Hotspot:** Comprehensive built-in hotspot functionality includes user management, captive portal, and RADIUS integration.
*   **Firewall:** Rich set of features to configure complex firewall rules, manage connections, and implement QoS.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Hardware capabilities limit overall performance and maximum connections.
    *   RouterOS has certain quirks and limitations in some specific implementations of protocols that might be different from other vendors.
* **Quality of Service (QoS)**
    * MikroTik's QoS is very robust. It includes shaping and prioritization based on traffic type, source/destination, etc.
    * It enables the control of bandwidth consumption, limit the download or upload speed for certain users and applications.
    * QoS is configured using queue-tree and simple queues, enabling hierarchical traffic management.

Make sure that the API service is enabled under `/ip service` and that `/user` has `api` permissions. API responses may vary slightly depending on RouterOS version. The `-k` flag is for ignoring certificate warnings.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** In MikroTik, bridging combines multiple interfaces into a single layer-2 broadcast domain. This allows for transparent switching between different interfaces. VLANs, on the other hand, segments the network. You need to choose your method of vlan configuration based on your network needs, either on physical interface level or bridging level.
*   **Routing:**  MikroTik uses a route table to decide where to send traffic based on the destination IP address. Routes can be static or dynamic (via routing protocols).
    *   **Routing Protocols**: MikroTik supports multiple routing protocols, including OSPF, RIP, BGP and ISIS. Routing protocols are very powerful tools for complex network setups to ensure connectivity.
    *   **Policy Routing**: Policy routing is a more flexible approach to routing traffic. Using policy routing, packets are routed based on certain attributes, including source and destination IPs, Ports, Protocol, interface the packet came from.
    * **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)**: VRF is a technique that allows you to create multiple isolated routing instances on a single physical router. Each VRF acts as its own virtual router, using its own unique routing table, which ensures complete logical separation of traffic between the instances.
*   **Firewall:** MikroTik's firewall uses a chain-based approach.
    *   **Connection Tracking:** The connection tracking mechanism allows the firewall to keep track of the state of ongoing network connections. This enables the firewall to make smart decisions about packet filtering. It allows for established and related connections to pass through the firewall.
    *   **NAT:**  Network Address Translation is used for transforming IP addresses, especially from private addresses to public addresses.
        * **Masquerade:**  Masquerading is a specific type of source NAT. It is a dynamic NAT, the router replaces the private source IP address of outgoing packets with the public IP address of the interface the traffic is going out to.
     *  **Packet Flow in RouterOS:** MikroTik RouterOS processes packets in a defined order:
        1.  **Ingress:** Packet enters the router on an interface.
        2.  **Pre-Routing:** Policy routing, connection tracking.
        3.  **Forward:** Firewall rules are applied, and routing decisions are made.
        4.  **Post-Routing:** NAT is applied.
        5.  **Egress:** Packet exits the router on an interface.
*   **DHCP:** The DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses to clients connecting to the network.
*   **DNS:** MikroTik can act as a DNS server or forward DNS queries to another server.
*   **IP Services:** MikroTik offers multiple IP services including SOCKS, proxy and other services which can help when creating special routing rules.
*   **Certificates**: When the API is secured using https, a certificate must be installed for verification, certificates can also be used for secure VPN setups.
*  **PPP (Point to Point Protocol):** PPP is a Layer 2 protocol commonly used for creating direct connections between two devices over serial, telephone, or other links. MikroTik supports the use of PPP for various use cases, such as L2TP connections for VPN access.
    * **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)**: Provides centralized user management for PPP connections, using protocols like RADIUS to manage user credentials.
*  **RADIUS:** RADIUS servers allow the centralization of user credentials and authentication process for several network devices, allowing scalability of the network setup and better control.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Change the default admin username and password immediately.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any services (e.g., telnet, FTP) that are not needed.
*   **Firewall Configuration:** Implement strong firewall rules, denying by default, and allowing only necessary traffic.
*   **API Security:** Secure the REST API with a strong password and HTTPS. Limit access to specific IP addresses.
*   **RouterOS Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Remote Access:**  Use secure protocols like SSH for remote access instead of telnet.
*   **User Management:** Create individual users with specific access levels instead of relying on the default user.
*   **RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network):** While convenient, use RoMON carefully, ideally within a dedicated management network, as it does not encrypt data by default. It's recommended to encrypt RoMON tunnels using IPSec.
* **IPsec:** IPSec provides encrypted communication for remote access and site-to-site tunnels. It should be used to secure connections between devices.
*  **Wireguard**: Wireguard is a modern and secure VPN protocol. It's a lighter protocol than IPSec, with good performance.
*   **Regular Backups:** Create regular backups of your router configuration.

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for Extended Topics**

Given the comprehensive nature of your request, we've covered many aspects in the sections above. However, let's touch upon a few more extended topics with specific examples:

*   **High Availability Solutions (VRRP):**

    *   **Concept:** VRRP provides a method for creating a redundant network setup where multiple routers can share a virtual IP address. One router is designated as the master, while others are backups. If the master fails, another backup automatically takes over.
    *   **Example:**
    ```mikrotik
     # Router 1 (Master)
        /interface vrrp add interface=vlan-25 vrid=1 priority=200 v3-protocol-type=ipv4 virtual-address=80.161.205.250/24
     # Router 2 (Backup)
        /interface vrrp add interface=vlan-25 vrid=1 priority=100 v3-protocol-type=ipv4 virtual-address=80.161.205.250/24
    ```
     *  **Explanation**:
         *   `/interface vrrp`: Access VRRP configuration.
         *   `add interface=vlan-25 vrid=1 priority=... virtual-address=80.161.205.250/24`:  Configure a VRRP instance with an ID of 1, priority setting is for master and backup determination, `virtual-address` is the address the clients will see as gateway.

*   **Mobile Networking (LTE):**

    *   **Concept:** MikroTik routers with LTE interfaces can be used for cellular internet access and for setting up a failover or load balancing system with existing WAN connections
    *  **Example**
        *   Assuming the LTE interface is named `lte1`
        ```mikrotik
        #  Enable the LTE interface
        /interface lte set lte1 disabled=no

        # Set the APN and other access settings
        /interface lte apn set 0 apn=internet user=lteaapn password=lteapnpass
        /interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+CGDCONT=1,\"IP\",\"internet\""

         # Add a route to access the internet via the LTE interface
        /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=lte1
        ```
        *   **Explanation**:
            *    `/interface lte set lte1 disabled=no`: Enable the lte interface
            *    `/interface lte apn set 0 apn=internet user=lteaapn password=lteapnpass` : Configure the APN using the provider details.
            *   `/interface lte at-chat lte1 input="AT+CGDCONT=1,\"IP\",\"internet\""`: AT commands may be necessary to use the correct apn configurations.
            * `/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=lte1` : Creates a route to the internet using the lte interface as gateway.
* **Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)**:
    * **Concept:** MPLS is a mechanism in IP networking where packets are forwarded based on labels instead of routing table lookups. In this method the forwarding decision is made based on short labels, which in theory provides better throughput.
    * **MPLS Use Cases:**
        *  **Traffic Engineering (TE):** Optimizing the routing paths for specific traffic flows.
        *   **Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS):** Create point-to-multipoint connections between different locations
    *   **Example**
        ```mikrotik
            #Router 1
             /mpls interface set [ find interface=ether2 ] enabled=yes
             /mpls ldp set enabled=yes lsr-id=10.1.1.1 transport-address=10.1.1.1
             /mpls ldp neighbor add transport-address=10.1.1.2
            #Router 2
              /mpls interface set [ find interface=ether2 ] enabled=yes
            /mpls ldp set enabled=yes lsr-id=10.1.1.2 transport-address=10.1.1.2
             /mpls ldp neighbor add transport-address=10.1.1.1
        ```
        *   **Explanation**:
            *   ` /mpls interface set [ find interface=ether2 ] enabled=yes`: enable mpls on a specific interface.
            *   ` /mpls ldp set enabled=yes lsr-id=10.1.1.1 transport-address=10.1.1.1` : LDP settings for the mpls system, the lsr-id should be the router's ID address.
            *   `/mpls ldp neighbor add transport-address=10.1.1.2` : define other mpls router's transport address to create adjacency.
*   **Network Management (Openflow)**
    * **Concept**:  Openflow is a protocol that allows a network controller to manage and manipulate the network switches and routers via a secure channel.
    * **Example:**
    ```mikrotik
        # Router 1
        /interface openflow
        add name=openflow-controller ports=ether2 controller-address=10.10.10.10 controller-port=6653
    ```
        *  **Explanation**:
            *    `/interface openflow`: Access openflow configurations.
            *   `add name=openflow-controller ports=ether2 controller-address=10.10.10.10 controller-port=6653` : Creates a new openflow configuration with specified interface, controller address and port.
*  **Routing (BGP)**:
    * **Concept**:  BGP is a path vector routing protocol, that uses a peer-to-peer system to communicate and exchange routing information with other networks and Autonomous systems.
    * **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
            # Router 1 (AS 65001)
            /routing bgp instance add name=bgp-instance as=65001
            /routing bgp peer add instance=bgp-instance name=peer-2 remote-address=10.1.1.2 remote-as=65002
        ```
        *  **Explanation**:
            *   `routing bgp instance add name=bgp-instance as=65001`: Creates a BGP instance with specified Autonomous system ID.
            *   `/routing bgp peer add instance=bgp-instance name=peer-2 remote-address=10.1.1.2 remote-as=65002` : creates a peer configuration to a remote router.
*  **System Information and Utilities (NTP)**
        * **Concept**: NTP is a protocol that synchronizes the internal system clock using network time servers.
        * **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /system ntp client
        set enabled=yes server-address=pool.ntp.org
        ```
            * **Explanation:**
            *  `/system ntp client`: Accesses NTP client settings
            *  `set enabled=yes server-address=pool.ntp.org`: Enables NTP client and configures a public time server.
*   **Virtual Private Networks (WireGuard):**
    *   **Concept:** WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol that prioritizes security and speed. It is lightweight and easier to configure than IPSec.
    *   **Example**
     ```mikrotik
        # Router 1 (Server)
        /interface wireguard add name=wg1 listen-port=13231
        /interface wireguard peers add interface=wg1 allowed-address=10.0.0.2/32 public-key="<client_public_key>"
        /ip address add interface=wg1 address=10.0.0.1/24
        # Router 2 (Client)
        /interface wireguard add name=wg1 listen-port=13231
        /interface wireguard peers add interface=wg1 allowed-address=0.0.0.0/0 endpoint="<server_public_ip>:13231" public-key="<server_public_key>" persistent-keepalive=25
        /ip address add interface=wg1 address=10.0.0.2/24
     ```
        *  **Explanation**
            *   `/interface wireguard add name=wg1 listen-port=13231`: Creates a new wireguard interface with a specified port.
            *  `/interface
