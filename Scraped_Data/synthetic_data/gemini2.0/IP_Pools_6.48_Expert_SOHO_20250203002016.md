2.  **Internal Network:** Provide IP addresses to our internal devices on the wired and primary wireless network.
3.  **VPN Client Network:** Assign addresses to devices connected via a VPN client.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS v6.48 or later (concepts are applicable to v7.x)
*   Basic networking knowledge
*   Wired Ethernet connection for router management
*   Wireless interface configured.
*   Understanding of subnetting.

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall 1: Overlapping IP Ranges:** If IP ranges overlap, DHCP servers will conflict.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Double-check pool ranges and ensure they are mutually exclusive.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Use `/ip pool print` to list all pools and ranges.
*   **Pitfall 2: DHCP Server Configuration:** DHCP server must be linked to an IP Pool and an interface.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Verify DHCP server configuration using `/ip dhcp-server print` and `/ip dhcp-server network print`.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Check the DHCP leases using `/ip dhcp-server lease print`.
*  **Pitfall 3:  Incorrect Network address:** Ensure that the network address is correctly configured for each respective subnet.
    *  **Troubleshooting:** Verify the network and addresses are correctly calculated and entered using a subnet calculator.
    * **Diagnostic:** Use the command `ip address print` to view all addresses, interface, and respective network addresses.
*   **Pitfall 4: Firewall Blocking DHCP:** Firewall rules might block DHCP traffic.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Inspect firewall rules using `/ip firewall filter print`. Make sure the chain allows traffic on ports `67` and `68`.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Use `/tool torch interface=<interface_name>` to see UDP traffic on port `67/68`.
*   **Pitfall 5: Incorrect Interface:** Ensure that correct interface is selected when configuring both the IP address and DHCP Server.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**  Check that the correct interface is selected in the DHCP Server settings in Winbox or via the CLI with `/ip dhcp-server print`.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Cross reference between interface names and the configuration provided.
*   **Pitfall 6: Gateway not correctly configured:** Ensure correct gateway IP is set in the DHCP server settings.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Double-check the gateway and IP Pool are configured correctly. Use a subnet calculator for verification.
    *   **Diagnostic:**  Check the gateway in the DHCP network setting using the command `/ip dhcp-server network print`.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping:**
    *   Connect a device to each network (guest, internal, VPN).
    *   Ping the gateway IP (`192.168.20.1`, `192.168.1.1`, and `10.10.10.1` respectively) using `ping 192.168.20.1` on the client for Guest network or `ping 192.168.1.1` on the internal network.
    *   Ping `8.8.8.8` from a device in each network to test connectivity.
*   **Traceroute:**
    *   Use `traceroute 8.8.8.8` from a client machine to see the path to the internet.
*   **Torch:**
    *   Run `/tool torch interface=<interface_name>` on the MikroTik to check for DHCP broadcast traffic (ports 67/68) while devices are connecting.
*   **Lease List:**
    *   Use `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to verify IP addresses are being assigned.
*   **Winbox:**
    *   Check IP assignments in `IP` -> `DHCP Server` -> `Leases`.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Binding:** You can statically assign IP addresses to specific MAC addresses via DHCP static leases.
*   **DHCP Options:** Use DHCP Options to provide additional parameters like DNS servers, NTP servers, or custom options.
*   **Pool Exclusion:** You can exclude certain IPs from a pool using exclusion ranges.
*   **Pool Size:** Consider the maximum devices that may connect.
*   **Lease Time:** Configure the lease time for DHCP IP address assignment.
*   **IPsec:**  Use of IP Pool within IPsec configuration can allow multiple VPN clients to connect to a network.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** Bridges connect multiple interfaces as a single network segment.  In our example, the `ether1` and `wlan1` interfaces, can be bridged which allows devices connected to both interfaces to communicate with each other.
*   **Routing:** Routing forwards network traffic between different IP networks. MikroTik uses a combination of static routes, dynamic routing protocols (like OSPF and BGP), and policy-based routing.
*   **Firewall:** The firewall protects your network by inspecting incoming and outgoing traffic and enforcing predefined rules, such as blocking certain types of traffic or allowing specific traffic to pass through.  A typical firewall allows forward traffic to/from the internet, and blocks access between interfaces.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for your router's admin account.
*   **Disable Default Users:** Disable or remove default accounts if not used, such as the "guest" account.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable unused services like Telnet.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to your router.
*   **RouterOS Updates:** Keep RouterOS up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **VPN:** Use a VPN to remotely manage your router securely.
*   **HTTPS for Web Access:**  Enable HTTPS for Winbox or Webfig management (use certificates).
*   **Disable API:**  Disable API unless specifically needed, use whitelist method for secure access.
*   **Enable RouterOS User Groups:** Use user groups to segment admin access to the router.
*  **Limit Login Attempts:** Configure the max login attempts before an IP is banned.
*  **Rate Limiting:** Configure rate limiting on your network to prevent a DDoS attacks.
*  **Avoid Default ports:** Change default ports for any service, and for winbox management.

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for MikroTik Topics**

(This section will be very extensive, so I will provide examples, summaries and important considerations for each topic.  If you require more in-depth examples for any of these, let me know.)

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):**
    *   **IPv4:** Covered in the examples above. Standard decimal notation (`192.168.1.1/24`).
    *   **IPv6:**  Enable IPv6 in `/ipv6 settings`. Use `/ipv6 address` to assign global and link-local addresses. Use `/ipv6 pool` for IPv6 address pools. (Note IPv6 configuration will depend heavily on your ISP configuration).
*   **IP Pools:** Covered extensively above.
*   **IP Routing:** Static routes `/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=<ISP_Gateway>`. Use dynamic routing protocols for more complex networks.
*   **IP Settings:** `/ip settings set` to change global settings like TCP timeouts. Use `/ipv6 settings set` for IPv6 configurations.
*   **MAC Server:**  Used for remote MAC address access to the router. Access at `/tool mac-server`.
*   **RoMON:** MikroTik's Router Management Protocol used for remote configuration and monitoring of MikroTik routers on the same L2 network. Use `/tool romon` for configuration. Enable password authentication.
*   **WinBox:**  The standard GUI for MikroTik routers. Ensure you use a secure login with a strong password and limit who can connect to Winbox. The default port `8291` can be changed.
*   **Certificates:** Use `/certificate` to manage router certificates. Used for HTTPS management, and other security related features such as IPsec, SSTP, and VPN

        * **Packet Flow:** RouterOS processes traffic through the following chain: input chain (traffic destined for router), forward chain (traffic passing through the router), and output chain (traffic originating from the router).
      *   **Queues:** Covered under "Quality of Service" section
      *   **Firewall and QoS Case Studies:** Common cases involve blocking specific ports, limiting traffic for certain users, or prioritizing video conferencing traffic.
      *   **Kid Control:** Uses firewall rules with time schedules to control access for specific clients.
      *   **UPnP/NAT-PMP:** Used to allow devices behind NAT to automatically forward ports. It is not recommend to use, and should be disabled or limited.
