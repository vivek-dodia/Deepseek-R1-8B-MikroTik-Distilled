Hi everyone,Could someone kindly assist me with a simple guest WiFi configuration that stopped working after migrating from the wireless package to wifi-qcom?The setup includes an RB5009 router and three cAP access points managed via Capsman. After the migration, wireless functionality significantly improved (e.g., band steering, roaming, and bandwidth efficiency). However, the isolated guest WiFi network has stopped working.The configuration is straightforward and doesn’t use VLANs: slave virtual WiFi interfaces share a dedicated bridge with client isolation enabled. The guest network has a separate IP range, its own DHCP server, and a dedicated set of firewall rules. This setup worked flawlessly prior to the migration. While it’s possible the new wifi-qcom package is incompatible with such attempt, I suspect I may have inadvertently disrupted the overall configuration while implementing the changes.Here’s the current status:* Guest WiFi clients connect successfully and are authorized.* However, there’s no DHCP negotiation, leaving clients unable to obtain IP addresses.router.rscap.rscI’d appreciate it if you could review the attached configuration and provide guidance on what might be wrong. I’ve also come across suggestions to implement guest networks using VLANs. While I see their advantages, there are a few concerns:* Capsman compatibility is limited—(at least AC devices) require manual VLAN configuration on each access point.* I’m worried about losing access to the router or access points during VLAN experiments if something goes wrong.
