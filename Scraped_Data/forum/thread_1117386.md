Any updates to this issue, is it better with SWOS ?It is really quiet here !?This week i installed on my 3 CRS354 the SWOS 2.13 in the office I had no problems at all, so I will begin on Monday to replace one of my 3 HP Procurve at production site with a CRS354.If there will be no problem after 2 weeks I will replace another one and so on.My configuration will have no VLAN, I bouht this Switches because of the 2 Power-Supplies and the SFP+ 10Gbit.I will report here, how it works with SWOS.CU

This thread was a disappointing find as I just purchased 2x of these.I just put them in a rack and started configuring last friday, then found this thread.I usually only run Long-term release so how long is it going to take before Testing-release changes show up?If they even fix the issues anyways?Here are some highlights from the latest Testing-release (6.49beta54 - July 5th, 2021):https://mikrotik.com/download/changelog ... lease-tree*) crs3xx - fixed jumbo frame forwarding for CRS354 devices (introduced in v6.49beta36);*) crs3xx - correctly filter packets by L2MTU on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for CRS354 devices;*) crs3xx - fixed packet forwarding on 1Gbps Ethernet interfaces for CRS354 devices (introduced in v6.49beta44);*) crs3xx - improved QSFP+ linking and mode changing for CRS326-24S+2Q+ and CRS354 devices;*) crs3xx - improved switch resource allocation for CRS317, CRS309, CRS312, CRS326-24S+2Q+ and CRS354 devices;*) poe - fixed PoE out functionality on CRS354 (introduced in v6.49beta22);*) sfp - improved link stability for 10G, 25G and 40G modules on CRS309, CRS312, CRS326-24S+2Q+ CRS354 and CCR2004 devices;It seems like we're not even past the re-introduce new problems phase :/Why would anyone expect issues to be improved or fixed if big ticket items are still being fixed or were re-introduced anyways?I <3 router OS and I've been waiting to get these for as long as i can remember, but now i'm wondering to what extent i'll use them at all. I can't physically babysit 48p switches.

Got this issue at ports 41-48 on 49beta54 firmware and 48G (non PoE switch). Outdoor security cameras on these ports went down. I thought the issue happened to 12V line or something like that but nothing helped until switch been rebooted few hours later. I guess it might be somehow related to big rain with thunder that night. Joints are sealed but nothing perfect in this world. Anyway whole block of ports went down and back after reboot. Sad story.

Well shit, I was about to build my new network with these switches at the core. The lack of response and root cause from Mikrotik sounds like they aren't able to fix this, I guess the Marvel chip is broken and they are trying software workarounds to no avail.Is there anyone at Mikrotik willing to confirm that hardware revision 2 and RouterOS 6.48+ makes this switch usable?

Well, it is now removed !!!  6.49.1 and port group traffic was still blocking !I'm really not happy in how Mikrotik dealing all this ! Not just for his product, but represent how they will deal with their other product and future product...This is not their small entry level 15$ home router...  I like having a single vendor for my equipment so there is no excuse that it because of someone else... But if they can't take care of their own gears...I'm really disappointed since I've been rooting for them for a while and I didn't want to spend the time to find replacement gear !

To anyone reading who desperately wants this to be fixed because the price is so attractive - it isn't fixed, if you put this device on your network, prepare for the worst.Why this is switch still for sale? The issues have ongoing for years and MT are either unable or willing to fix them.My setup was reasonably straight forward - just default switching with a single VLAN on the bridge. Connections to SFP+ ports were fine, the 1Gb ports were just downtime waiting to happen on a fairly regular basis. Always had the most recent stable FW (was up to 6.48.4 before I pulled the plug on it). Functions In SwOS just fine, but you can get that level of functionality for better prices elsewhere.

Called back on Friday...Customer, "That VPN hub spoke thing you did is working great. But we are having a lot of problems with local devices staying connected. We pulled the Mikrotik switches and put in some Merakis. The wired stuff stays connected now..."I explained about this thread and my past experience.Customer, "Well I guess that explains it."He was pretty cool with having to swap out the switches. Must have had a return period with his distributor. Or must have actually made some money buy putting in the Meraki switches for a FLAT network.

But we are having a lot of problems with local devices staying connectedThat is a general description.Did you actually observe this problem yourself ?Any log check on the devices?The previous posts mention that the switch stops forwarding traffic until reboot, but in your case there is no such description...e.g. the client was rebooting the switches ? otherwise how was the problem resolved ? So are we talking about the same problem ?ROS version on the switches ?

Zacharias,I worked for them on Friday.When I called on the NEXT FRIDAY, to ask about adding more users on Zerotier... That's when they told me they wanted me to look at the WIRELESS to explain why they were having problems.They had already replaced one switch BEFORE they called.They moved the Wireless to the Meraki switch and they could maintain connections.I didn't wanna touch the switches when they were in. They had "just been installed" and I didn't want to blamed if this happened. I am pretty sure I saw 6.48 in winbox when I was working on the router.

I just wanted to post some positive feedback which is much needed during these times.We have 10 units of CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+ running flawlessly.Running stable 6.49.6Features used: multiple VLANS, Dot1x, PoE, DHCP snooping, STP etc.Purchased in multiple batches, running for various time - from years to couple of months.Factory firmware varies from 6.46.1 to 6.48.3Only complain is the "weird" Q+ ports which acts as 4 separate ones, but that is by design.

They require daily reboots to work as basic layer 2 switches.The 354 was flawed at release. 2+ years later it's still not fixed.Much like the RB1200 or their client serving wifi... There is stuff Mikrotik can not fix. Move on.

### Post 44

@gotsprings what is the revision version under /system routerboard ?I did update the switches to whatever was current that day. Ergo routerOS and board firmware.As for watching it...I had seen it at home years ago. You will see a bunch of ports that just seem to be at idle. I could send a ping through those ports... So it would appear as if it was working. But nothing bigger than a ping seemed to go.Power cycling the switch would return normal operation for a few hours or days.Now if you look in another recent thread... A guy took over a hotel and the switches are doing this exactly.I followed up with the guys I worked for and they had already pulled the switches. "If we had asked you first we never would have put them in."Problems vanished when the switches did.

I am having a similar problem. I don't know if it is certain ports.The ports are switched and the moment the device boots traffic goes through. After a while, I think if I also transfer something like 100mbit data for a few seconds it stops working. No data is going through some ports.I tried it several times and all of the times it was doing it.At first I thought I was doing something wrong at my gateway (ccr2116-12g-4s+) breaking my b@!!S but it seems that it was because of the CRS354.I had 7.5 and 7.6beta8 on the switch.Btw all the devices are brand new and I am still preparing the setup for the customer before the installation takes place.For now it looks solved by moving to SwOS but I would rather have RouterOS running.Any help would be appreciated since the installation date is in 2 weeks

It is brand new not delivered to the customer yet. At first I was breaking my head spending hours trying to spot what I was doing wrong in my config. Then I looked it up and found that post with pretty similar problem. I also turned it to SwOS and nothing changed. You only see traffic going out and nothing coming back. If you disable and enable the port it is not coming back. The moment I reboot the switch it starts working again communicating for a while and then the problem returns. If I had read that post before I buy it I would still buy it and I wouldn't believe that it wouldn't be fixed by now.

Is there a way to identify the problem when ports stop working? To create a script that would reboot the switchin that case. MikroTik has become completely unprofessional in their business, and I don't understand why the EU doesn't do something and ban them from selling faulty products in the EU territory. They know about this issue and know that the devices they sell are technically faulty, yet they continue to be sold. This is against all laws and regulations.I bought 5 of these switches and all 5 are faulty. I filed a complaint and received 5 new ones that are also defective.

Sadly... Pings still pass when the port is "locked up". This makes it harder to figure out.But the new netwatch can query for a webpage. Maybe that would be enough to let netwatch know it's down. Then you could REBOOT THE WHOLE SWITCH.(That's right... That's what has to be done when ports stop passing traffic.)

I have had 2 of these switches running live with no issues for over 6 months running RouterOS v6.49.6. The load on these is not large and only 4 or 5 ports are really being used on them at a time. I recently started swapping out some rack switches with these switches before I ran across this thread and what a mistake that has been so far. The first one I swapped in lasted for 33 days before port flapping for a few hours and then halting all traffic altogether when no was in the office. The other one did the same thing within 4 hours of going live, all ports just stopped passing traffic except for the management port. These new ones I swapped in were both running RouterOS v7.8 (stable) These are very basic setups with no VLAN's. Hard to believe they have not recalled this product at this point.

Been having this issue across our stores. We have 100+ of these switches installed and ports 9-16 are basically unusable. We have put it on our "do not use" list and are using 2 of the CRS328-24P-4S+RM in place of 1 of the 48P switches.Sad. But in our last order of these switches I noticed that it now says "r3" for revision 3. All our previous switches were either r1 or r2 (mostly r2) so I wonder what is new with this r3 version?Screenshot 2023-06-15 at 2.03.26 PM.png

Today is Oct 3 2023...And the 3 CRS354s are still locking up.Updated the firmware last week and that buys a day or two between reboots.This thread is 1252 day old.

And now the switch is not in stock at the suppliers in Denmark...I'm thinking of buying 2 pcs. I don't think I will have any problems returning a switch if it shows that some of the ports will have the issue.

I've tried searching at all major suppliers in Denmark, strange... Our main supplier can't tell anything about delivery date, because the import company don't have a date... I wonder if it's related with the issues, or it's just shortages.

CRS354's QSFP+ and SFP+ ports combined with the RJ45 ports, matches exactly what we need for our 2x "Server / Distribution" switches in our setup.Is anybody familiar with the HPE FlexFabric 5900AF 48G 4XG 2QSFP+ ? The specs looks very much the same but I've not worked with HP switches before...Edit: Ok, that HPE 5900AF is rather old... Is anybody aware of an alternative with minimum 2x QSF+, 2x SFP+ and 24x RJ45 ports, alternative minimum 6x SFP+ and 24x RJ45 ports ?

We unfurtuantely have the same issue, but our CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+ ran fine for many month until about christmas 2023. Probably because we use it with SwOS from the beginning it took longer for the problem to occure. Now as we received strange network issues with failing ports 1-8, I found this thread and took about two hours to read through the previous years. Problem is that there is not a newer SwOS version than 2.13.The problem seems to be not fixed yet, after nearly four years and I doubt it will get fixed in the future.

Just  clients connected to eth ports become offline. Still have LINK but no data are transfered.Yesterday I bought new crs354 r3 unit and replace it. So now I am curious if will help or will this new revision on new unit will do the same sh*t.BTW. for testing purposes I was not using first 8 port for couple months, it did not help, problem was still the same

For my part I have 4x48P units at a customer site that have not exhibited this problem that we know which have been up well over 1y at this point, but also 3 of the 4 are really sparsely populated, so if there was a block of 8 stopped ports on a switch it is not impossible it is simply a block of 8 which are not in use and so it's not been noticed. They're pretty minimal config, no LAGs, at most 4 vlans, and all just uplink to a RB4011, so they're about as basic as it gets.The only reason I am here is because I was about to buy 2x48G that would see much more use than those existing 48P switches and I have now seen this thread....Has anyone else tried the 7.14 betas with these switches like the last poster here to see if it cures their issues? Seems a bit early for them to declare success given some people in here have said they'd had as much as a month or so with no issues on other firmware;viewtopic.php?t=202646#p1049369

I was brought in on a job where they already had the switches. And they were having to reboot the switches DAILY!. As soon as they told me the model of the Switch I described exactly what was going wrong.Client, "Is there a fix?"Me, "You found the workaround. Reboot it and it works 'for a while'. Since pings still pass when its locked up... you could maybe set the DLI to check a webport. When that stops working reboot???"All switches were tossed.

I just found this topic and read everything that was written before me and realized that I’m not alone)At my work I have 2xCRS354-48P-4S+2Q+ installed running on SwOS, one with firmware 2.13 and the other with 2.16. For half a year there were no problems, and then a month ago problems similar to what was written here began, sometimes a block of ports and sometimes all ports freeze at the same time. Only a reboot helps, and not always right away, sometimes after a reboot the traffic is up for a few seconds and then down again. Sometimes the switch does not freeze for weeks, sometimes it freezes several times a day. When the problem started, I installed a new switch of the same type, same problem(The problem is specifically on the switch with SwOS 2.16 firmware where 17x Poe access points and 1x Poe camera are connected, and in the switch with firmware 2.13 there are no problems yet, but maybe this is due to the fact that this one is less loaded - 13x Poe access points and 1x Poe camera.

This issue has been resolved in RouterOS, but not yet in SwOS. Mikrotik support informed me that they are currently working on implementing the same fix in SwOS as well.There are two main issues with this switch that often get mixed together:1. All ports occasionally freeze [FIXED in RouterOS].2. Specific port groups stop passing traffic [NOT yet fixed].The second issue is particularly challenging because Mikrotik cannot reproduce it when the switches are returned for RMA. It seems to be triggered by specific network applications.

### Post 149

I have been facing issues with this model for almost a year. For the issue of hanging ports, Mikrotik support suggested a temporary solution using a scheduled script:Code:Select allif ([/ping gateways_IP count=10] = 0) \
do={
  /interface ethernet disable [find where switch=switch1];
  :delay 3s;
  /interface ethernet enable [find where switch=switch1];
  log warning "Resetting switch1 !!!"
}At some point, I received a pre-release version of RouterOS, which seemed to resolve the port hanging issue. Later, an official stable firmware update was released on July 16, 2024, and I received a notification from Mikrotik confirming that the solution for the port hang issue was included in this update. I updated to the latest stable release and have been keeping it up to date since then.However, on RouterOS 7.15.3, the port hanging problem reappeared, so I re-enabled the scheduled script. Since then, I have observed the script resetting all ports only once. I am uncertain whether this was due to the port hanging issue or simply a lack of ping response during other network activities at the time. I am continuing to monitor the situation closely.However, another problem occurs periodically: sometimes the network slows down almost to a complete stop. After extensive testing and debugging, I discovered that the switch occasionally sends random data to all network ports as packets. For example, I found a packet made from a fragment of JSON data, and the source (SRC) and destination (DST) MAC addresses were random (not present in the network). These packets are transmitted across the entire network as the switches attempts to locate the DST MAC address (receiver) but are ultimately dropped at the endpoints.Because the SRC MAC address is also random, it gets registered in the MAC tables of all network devices. Due to the high volume of random packets, the MAC tables on all devices grow rapidly, clearly indicating that the CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+ switch has started malfunctioning.Throughout this time, I performed various reconfigurations and tests. Today, the switch malfunctioned again. My test setup consisted of only a router and the switch, with all other ports disabled except one connected to the router. The router was configured with only a WAN interface and one port connected to the switch. The switch was transmitting random packets to the router, but the traffic from the router was clean. After rebooting the switch, the random traffic stopped in both directions. The CPU usage of the switch also dropped from ~30% to 6–9%. RouterOS v7.16.2, firmware updated.It seems like there is some kind of buffer overflow in the OS or a memory issue.I have provided all this information to Mikrotik support and am currently waiting for their response. In the meantime, I am preparing the device for return, either to replace it with another model or switch to a different brand, as I no longer have the time or energy to deal with these issues in a production network.
