Hello mikrotik fans,I will be bringing up a btest server soon. I have preprared one RB800 and a 1Gbit connection dedicated only for the sake of testing.It is ready, but I want to limit the usage somehow before I post it public. I have created filter rule for input that puts your IP in ban address list for X period of time.I can't figure out how to limit the test sessions per time. You can basically let it run indefinately. Can you tell me how to disconnect every btest connection for example on 5min?

Nice work!You can check out the configuration of TomjNorthIdaho posted here:viewtopic.php?f=2&t=104266&p=690150#p690150/ip firewall rawadd action=accept chain=prerouting comment="testers accepted" src-address-list=testeradd action=drop chain=prerouting comment="previous testers drop" src-address-list=previousadd action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=tester address-list-timeout=2m chain=prerouting comment="add to tester" dst-port=2000-2100 protocol=tcpadd action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=tester address-list-timeout=2m chain=prerouting comment="add to tester" dst-port=2000-2100 protocol=udpadd action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=previous address-list-timeout=15m chain=prerouting comment="add to previous" dst-port=2000-2100 log=yes protocol=tcpadd action=add-src-to-address-list address-list=previous address-list-timeout=15m chain=prerouting comment="add to previous" dst-port=2000-2100 log=yes protocol=udpThis will limit tests to 2m every 15m per ip address.

I did check his config and set it up nicely. Everything works except when the timer runs out for "testing" address list it wouldnt drop the traffic server>client only the other way. This issue appears only when testing UDP. With TCP test there is no problem. I worked on this for about 6 hours last night and I couldnt find a solution. Anyone else experenced this iisue?Should I provide any screenshots?

Have you enabled fasttrack? I will probably bypass raw firewall, however doesn't explain why tcp is working.Please do no post screenshots, just export config (/export hide-sensitive) and paste in code blocks.Also.. TomjNorthIdaho mentioned more than a terabyte of traffic per month hosting public bandwidth server.Are you sure your connection can handle such large amount of traffic?

I have enabled fasttrack, but it doesn't count packets so I guess i doesn't apply for this.I will post config as soon as I can.The mikrotik will be in a datacenter for the clients to test their bandwith and also for public use. So yes the network behind it will handle alot

Thanks nescafe2002 for testing. It's interesting how much CPU will be consumed on full bandwidth. Today max was 660mbps and the cpu was around 30%. Tell me from which IP you are testing so I can remove you from ban list for another try

I will check my logs to see if for some reason your IP has been blocked.2 ) Is your Mikrotik a firewall or behind a firewall ?
