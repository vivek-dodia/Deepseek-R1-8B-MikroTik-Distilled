Hello, I have a problem with SNMP via WireGuard, I have launched a Zabbix server on my home network and I have 5-6 Mikrotiks on the local network and it intercepts them without any problems, however, on my two remote points, which are via WG, the server does not intercept them. I have ping from Zabbix to the routers and back. I also tried via snmpwalk from Linux on my desktop computer, but I still do not see them. I think the problem is something in the tunnel itself, but I do not know exactly where. The tunnel is launched between Mikrotiks.
