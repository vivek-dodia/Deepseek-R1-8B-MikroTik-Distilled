## Response 12
At least for now.Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident as the MT cloud appears to lack sufficient redundancy. Whenever possible, we are phasing out the built-in function in favour of Cloudflare DDNS which is highly redundant and locally available through out the world. ---

## Response 13
I also have never used the Mikrotik DDNS service. Using Dynu.com and have never had a failure in a good five years. ---

Whenever possible, we are phasing out the built-in function in favour ofCloudflareDDNS which is highly redundant and locally available through out the world.Naturally, it works, and thus why MT should provide Cloudflare ZeroTrust Tunnel! Reliable!, safe! an excellent options package for all routers. ---
