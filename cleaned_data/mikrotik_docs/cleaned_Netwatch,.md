# Summary
Netwatch monitors the state of hosts on the network. Monitoring can be done with the following probe types:1) ICMP - pings to a specified IP address - hosts, with an option to adjust threshold values2) Simple - uses ping, without use of advanced metrics3) TCP conn, to test the TCP connection4) HTTP GET/HTTPS GET, request against a server you are monitoring5) DNS - sends DNS query to DNS server and checks for response.For each entry in the Netwatch table, you can specify an IP address, ping interval, and console scripts. The main advantage of Netwatch is its ability to issue arbitrary console commands on host state changes.

Property | Description
----------------------
host(Default:"") | The IP address of the server to be probed. Formats:-ipv4-ipv4@vrf-ipv6-ipv6@vrf-ipv6-linklocal%interface- domain name(for type=dns)
type(icmp| tcp-conn | http-get |http-get | dns |simple;Default:simple) | Type of the probe:-icmp- (ping-style) series of ICMP request-response with statistics-tcp-conn- test TCP connection (3-way handshake) to a server specified by IP and port-http-get- do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies-https-get- do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies-dns- do a specified DNS query for domain name- simple - simplified ICMP probe, with fewer options than "ICMP" type, used for backward compatibility with the older Netwatch version
interval(Default:10s) | The time interval between probe tests
timeout(Default:3s) | Max time limit to wait for a response
src-address(Default:"") | Source IP address which the Netwatch will try to use in order to reach the host. If address is not present, then the host will be considered as "down".
start-delay(Default:3s) | Time to wait before starting probe (on add, enable, or system start)
startup-delay(Default:5m) | Time to wait until starting Netwatch probe after system startup
up-script(Default:"") | Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'fail' --> 'OK'
down-script(Default:"") | Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'OK' --> 'fail'
test-script(Default:"") | Script to execute at the end of every probe test
The IP address of the server to be probed. Formats:
-ipv4-ipv4@vrf-ipv6-ipv6@vrf-ipv6-linklocal%interface- domain name(for type=dns)

Type of the probe:-icmp- (ping-style) series of ICMP request-response with statistics-tcp-conn- test TCP connection (3-way handshake) to a server specified by IP and port-http-get- do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies-https-get- do an HTTP Get request and test for a range of correct replies-dns- do a specified DNS query for domain name- simple - simplified ICMP probe, with fewer options than "ICMP" type, used for backward compatibility with the older Netwatch version
The time interval between probe tests
Max time limit to wait for a response
Source IP address which the Netwatch will try to use in order to reach the host. If address is not present, then the host will be considered as "down".
Time to wait before starting probe (on add, enable, or system start)
Time to wait until starting Netwatch probe after system startup
Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'fail' --> 'OK'
Script to execute on the event of probe state change 'OK' --> 'fail'
Script to execute at the end of every probe test
Netwatch executes scripts as *sys user, so any defined global variable in the Netwatch script will not be readable by for an example a scheduler or other users
It is possible to disable permission checking for RouterOS scripts under/system/scriptsmenu. This is useful when Netwatch does not have enough permissions to execute a script, though this decreases overall security. It is recommended to assign proper permissions to a script instead.
# Type-specific options
All config options specific to one probe type (e.g. icmp's packet-interval) are ignored for other probe types.

# Logs
On each probe's OK/fail state change:
# Status
Command/tool/netwatch/printwill show the current status of Netwatch andread-onlyproperties:
# Quick Example
Here we will use a simple ICMP check to host with IP 8.8.8.8:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > /tool/netwatch add host=8.8.8.8 interval=30s up-script=":log info \"Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful\""
```
Afterward, in the logging section we can see Netwatch executed script:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > log print where message~"8.8.8.8"
08:03:26 script,info Ping to 8.8.8.8 successful
```
