Okay, let's dive into creating detailed technical documentation for IP routing on a MikroTik RouterOS device, specifically focusing on the scenario you've provided.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario involves configuring a MikroTik router within a SOHO environment to handle traffic for a specific subnet: 28.244.234.0/24. The network segment is connected to the router via a VLAN interface named `vlan-85`. This documentation will focus on creating the necessary IP address configuration and ensuring the router correctly routes traffic to and from this network.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the IP routing for the given scenario.

1.  **Step 1: Verify Existing Interface List**
    *   **Explanation:** Before making any changes, it's good practice to list the existing interfaces. This helps confirm if your interface (`vlan-85`) already exists and what other interfaces are present.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface print
        ```
    *   **Example Output (Before):**
        ```
        Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic, R - running, S - slave
         #     NAME                                TYPE      MTU   L2MTU
         0  R  ether1                              ether     1500  1598
         1  R  ether2                              ether     1500  1598
         2  R  ether3                              ether     1500  1598
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to "Interface" menu, and see the list of interfaces.
    *   **Effect:** This step shows a basic list of the currently configured interfaces.

2.  **Step 2: Create VLAN Interface (if necessary)**
    *   **Explanation:** If the `vlan-85` interface does not exist, it needs to be created. This step assumes a parent interface (e.g., `ether2`) already exists. Adjust `ether2` to your appropriate interface.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan add name=vlan-85 vlan-id=85 interface=ether2
        ```
    *   **Example Output (Before):** (Same as step 1, if no VLAN is set)
    *   **Example Output (After - if new VLAN created):**
        ```
         Flags: X - disabled, D - dynamic, R - running, S - slave
         #     NAME                                TYPE      MTU   L2MTU
         0  R  ether1                              ether     1500  1598
         1  R  ether2                              ether     1500  1598
         2  R  ether3                              ether     1500  1598
         3  R  vlan-85                             vlan      1500  1598
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Go to `Interfaces`
        *   Click the `+` sign and select `VLAN`
        *   Fill in `Name` as `vlan-85`, `VLAN ID` as `85`, `Interface` as `ether2` (or your actual interface)
        *   Click `Apply`
    *   **Effect:** This step adds the VLAN interface to the list of interfaces.

3.  **Step 3: Assign IP Address to the Interface**
    *   **Explanation:**  Now, we will assign an IP address from the 28.244.234.0/24 subnet to the `vlan-85` interface. We'll use 28.244.234.1/24 as the IP of the router on this VLAN.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address add address=28.244.234.1/24 interface=vlan-85
        ```
    *   **Example Output (Before):**
        ```
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
         #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
        ```
    *   **Example Output (After):**
        ```
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
         #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
         0   28.244.234.1/24     28.244.234.0    vlan-85
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Go to `IP` -> `Addresses`
        *   Click the `+` sign
        *   Fill in `Address` as `28.244.234.1/24`, `Interface` as `vlan-85`
        *   Click `Apply`
    *   **Effect:** This step assigns the specified IP address to the interface. This makes the router reachable from the 28.244.234.0/24 network.

4. **Step 4: Verify Routing Table**
   *   **Explanation:** Verify that the router has an automatically created route for the subnet to which the IP address was added.
   *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip route print
        ```
   *   **Example Output (After Step 3):**
        ```
        Flags: X - disabled, A - active, D - dynamic, C - connect, S - static, r - rip, b - bgp, o - ospf, m - mme, B - blackhole, U - unreachable, P - prohibit
        #      DST-ADDRESS        PREF-SRC        GATEWAY         DISTANCE
        0 ADC  28.244.234.0/24   28.244.234.1   vlan-85         0
        ```
   *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Go to `IP` -> `Routes`
   *   **Effect:** This step shows the routing table, confirming that the router knows how to reach the connected network. The `ADC` flag indicates that this route is *A*ctive, *D*ynamic and *C*onnected.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the consolidated set of MikroTik CLI commands:

```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-85 vlan-id=85 interface=ether2
/ip address
add address=28.244.234.1/24 interface=vlan-85
```

### Parameter Explanations:

| Command          | Parameter   | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/interface vlan add` | `name`     | Specifies the name of the new VLAN interface (`vlan-85`).                  |
|                  | `vlan-id` | The VLAN ID number (`85`).                                                     |
|                  | `interface` | The physical parent interface this VLAN belongs to (`ether2`).       |
| `/ip address add` | `address`   | The IP address and subnet mask to be assigned to the interface (`28.244.234.1/24`). |
|                  | `interface` | The interface to assign the IP address to (`vlan-85`).             |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

1.  **Incorrect Parent Interface:**
    *   **Problem:** Using the wrong physical interface (`etherX`) when creating the VLAN can cause no connectivity.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the interface in both Winbox and via CLI with `/interface print`
2.  **VLAN ID Mismatch:**
    *   **Problem:** If the VLAN ID on the MikroTik and the switch are different, there will be no connectivity.
    *   **Solution:** Verify VLAN ID on switch and router matches. Check that the trunk port is configured on the switch.
3.  **Address Overlap:**
    *   **Problem:** Assigning an IP address that's already in use on the network will cause conflicts.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the IP address is unique and within the correct subnet.
4.  **Incorrect Subnet Mask:**
    *   **Problem:** Using an incorrect subnet mask (e.g., /25 instead of /24) will cause routing issues.
    *   **Solution:** Always use the correct subnet mask `/24` for this scenario or adjust it for your specific needs.
5.  **Firewall Rules:**
    *   **Problem:** If your firewall is active, make sure to allow forward traffic from/to the vlan-85 interface.
    *  **Solution:** Create rules in the firewall to allow traffic on the VLAN, if needed
6.  **No L2 connectivity:**
   *  **Problem:** If the router does not receive the tagged VLAN traffic, it will not show the link as active.
   *  **Solution:** Check the switch port configuration and the trunking setting.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Ping Test:**
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ping 28.244.234.254
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** Ping another device within the 28.244.234.0/24 network (if one exists). This verifies basic IP connectivity and that the router can reach devices on that VLAN.
    *   **Expected Output:** A series of replies should show the ping is successful. If ping fails, see Common Pitfalls for troubleshooting.
2.  **Interface Status:**
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface print
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** Check that the `vlan-85` is running and has a valid status.
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Check that `vlan-85` interface is enabled and has a state of `R` for `running`.
3. **Routing Table:**
    * **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip route print
        ```
     * **Explanation:** Verify that the router has an active and connected route for the subnet 28.244.234.0/24.
     * **Expected Output:**  A route for `28.244.234.0/24` will be visible with an `ADC` flag (Active, Dynamic, Connected).
4.  **Torch Tool (Advanced):**
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool torch interface=vlan-85
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** This tool allows you to see all traffic passing through the interface. Can help to isolate connectivity issues.
    *   **Expected Output:** Should show network traffic when you ping or attempt communication between two devices in the subnet.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server:** You'll likely want to enable a DHCP server on the `vlan-85` interface if you need clients on that network to obtain IP addresses automatically.

    * CLI Command:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp-vlan-85 interface=vlan-85 address-pool=dhcp-pool-vlan-85
    /ip pool add name=dhcp-pool-vlan-85 ranges=28.244.234.10-28.244.234.254
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=28.244.234.0/24 gateway=28.244.234.1
    ```
*   **Firewall Rules:** If you want to control what traffic goes in and out of the `vlan-85` interface, you need to create appropriate firewall rules. Be sure that this traffic is allowed.
*   **Routing Protocols:** In more complex environments, you could use routing protocols (OSPF, BGP) instead of static routes. This basic setup does not require those.
*   **VPNs:** You could combine this VLAN with a VPN for secure access.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Here are some REST API examples using RouterOS's API (Note: you must enable API access):

**1.  Create VLAN interface:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/interface/vlan`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **JSON Payload:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "vlan-85",
      "vlan-id": 85,
      "interface": "ether2"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (Success):**
    ```json
    {
        ".id": "*0",
        "name": "vlan-85",
        "mtu": "1500",
        "l2mtu": "1598",
        "vlan-id": "85",
        "interface": "ether2",
        "arp": "enabled",
         "disabled": "false"
    }
    ```

**2. Create IP Address**

* **Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
     "address": "28.244.234.1/24",
     "interface": "vlan-85"
    }
    ```
* **Expected Response (Success):**
     ```json
    {
        ".id": "*1",
        "address": "28.244.234.1/24",
        "network": "28.244.234.0",
        "interface": "vlan-85",
        "actual-interface": "vlan-85",
        "invalid": "false",
        "dynamic": "false"
    }
    ```

**3.  Get IP Address:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Expected Response (Success):**

    ```json
     [
        {
          ".id": "*0",
          "address": "10.0.0.2/24",
          "network": "10.0.0.0",
          "interface": "ether1",
          "actual-interface": "ether1",
          "invalid": "false",
          "dynamic": "false"
        },
        {
          ".id": "*1",
          "address": "28.244.234.1/24",
          "network": "28.244.234.0",
          "interface": "vlan-85",
           "actual-interface": "vlan-85",
          "invalid": "false",
          "dynamic": "false"
        }
      ]
    ```

**Error Handling:** If there are issues, the API will typically return a `400 Bad Request` or `500 Internal Server Error` with a JSON response that includes the error message. Example:

```json
{
  "message": "already have address on interface vlan-85"
}
```

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Access Control:** Limit access to the router via IP address restrictions or using a VPN.
*   **Firewall:** Only allow the necessary traffic to the router and any attached networks. Ensure access for management.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong passwords and consider key-based authentication.
*   **Software Updates:** Keep RouterOS up to date to patch any vulnerabilities.
*   **API access:** Limit the scope of API access using API groups, and consider using HTTPS.
*   **Unused Services:** Disable any unused services such as FTP, Telnet, and WWW (if not using Winbox).

## Self Critique and Improvements:

The current configuration is a solid foundation for IP routing with a VLAN in a SOHO environment.

*   **Potential Improvement**: Add a DHCP server configuration. (Already implemented above)
*   **Further Modification**: Could be extended to include basic firewall rules, address lists for more robust control, and even integrate with a VLAN switch on the other end of the `ether2` interface.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

**IP Routing** is the fundamental process that allows devices on different networks to communicate. The router analyzes the destination IP address of data packets and forwards them to the correct next-hop router on their path.

In RouterOS, IP routing is handled by the routing table. Each interface that is assigned an IP address automatically generates a "Connected" route to the address space associated with that interface. Static and dynamic routes can be added based on the network topology.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:**
    *   **Static Routes:**
        *   **Pros:** Simpler for small networks, predictable behavior, lower resource utilization.
        *   **Cons:** Requires manual configuration, not adaptable to network changes, does not scale well.
    *   **Dynamic Routes (OSPF, BGP):**
        *   **Pros:** Automatically adapts to network topology changes, scales well, can handle redundancy.
        *   **Cons:** More complex to set up, may require more router resources, not needed for small networks.

    In this SOHO scenario, using connected routes and DHCP server is the proper route.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

*   **RouterOS 6.48 and 7.x:** All commands and configurations described here are valid for both versions of RouterOS. API and CLI have largely stayed the same in core functionality.  Minor differences can occur based on the new features available in RouterOS 7.x, but this specific configuration is compatible.
*   **Version Checks:** Always verify your specific routerOS documentation for any specific commands and parameters. If there are unexpected issues, consult the changelogs to identify anything that may be different.

This detailed documentation should provide a comprehensive guide for configuring IP routing on your MikroTik RouterOS device for this specific scenario. Let me know if you have any further questions or scenarios.
