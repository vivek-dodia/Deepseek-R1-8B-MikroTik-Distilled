I write an example:Code:Select allHi all,Is it possible to disable the terminal prompt, like in Windows shell with the "echo off" command?Thanks.MaxHow do you mean?Like that it should echo back when you type on the keyboard?You can enable api-ssl instead of using ssh for the scripting.

You want to write and execute on terminalsystem routerboard printcommand without seeing written characters?That's the purpose off"echo off"or@per single command for batch scripts executed in windows cmd (or old DOS) shell, also ROS scripts doesn't print executed commands when running them with/system/script/run.

```
@echo off
set pippo=topolino
set pippo
echo on
set pippo=pluto
set pippo
```

Thanks everyone for the suggestions.My question was simply to get clean output without printing the prompt, just like the "@echo off" statement in Windows cmd.The @echo off command in a batchdoes not suppress prompt, it suppresses echoing the following commands (including the prompt), so it is still not clear what you are asking for.Exmple batch pippoecho.cmd:Code:Select allThe output of the above is:C:\batches>pippoecho.cmdpippo=topolinoC:\batches>set pippo=plutoC:\batches>set pippopippo=plutoMaybe you could post an example of something that you are doing, the actual current output of that and an edited version of that output in the way you would like it to be.
