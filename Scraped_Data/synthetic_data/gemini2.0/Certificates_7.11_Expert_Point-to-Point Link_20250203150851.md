Okay, let's dive deep into MikroTik RouterOS certificates with a focus on a Point-to-Point link scenario, specifically for RouterOS 7.11 (also including considerations for 6.48 and earlier 7.x).

## Scenario Description:

This scenario involves configuring certificates on a MikroTik router acting as an endpoint in a Point-to-Point (PtP) link. We will generate a self-signed certificate and use this to secure communication of a service or a specific tunnel. This configuration is useful to secure services like Webfig, API, or IPsec tunnels. The primary objective is to securely manage the router remotely via HTTPS (Webfig) or API (or both) using self signed certificates.

## Implementation Steps:

**Prerequisites:**

*   You have access to a MikroTik router running RouterOS 7.11 (or 6.48 or other 7.x versions) connected to a network with the configured subnet 149.8.119.0/24 on the interface named `ether-3`.
*   Basic understanding of MikroTik RouterOS, including IP addressing, and navigating the CLI or Winbox.
*   The IP address of the router on interface `ether-3` is known; for this example, let's assume it's `149.8.119.2`.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Step 1: Initial Configuration Check**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensure we have a basic configuration to begin with, focusing on the target interface.
    *   **Action:** Let's first check if interface `ether-3` is configured with the correct IP address and is enabled, and display the current certificate list. We will then clear any previously configured certificate for this exercise.
    *   **CLI Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        # Check interface configuration
        /interface ethernet print where name="ether-3"
        # Check IP address configuration
        /ip address print where interface="ether-3"
        # Check existing certificates
        /certificate print
        # Clear existing certificates (optional - for testing purposes)
        /certificate remove [find]
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Go to `Interface` and verify that `ether-3` is enabled.
        *   Go to `IP` -> `Addresses` and verify that an IP address is assigned to `ether-3`.
        *   Go to `System` -> `Certificates` to inspect existing certificates. Clear any existing certificates if you desire.
    *   **Expected Output:** The output will show the interface configuration and its assigned IP. The certificate list should either be empty or display previously existing certificates.
        
        If no IP address is assigned to `ether-3`, configure one by running the following command:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address add address=149.8.119.2/24 interface=ether-3
        ```
        or alternatively via Winbox by navigating to IP -> Addresses -> add.
        
2.  **Step 2: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**
    *   **Purpose:** Create a self-signed certificate that we'll use for securing our services.
    *   **Action:** Use the `/certificate` command to create a new certificate. We'll set the common name (CN) to the router's IP address on the target interface (for easier identification).
    *   **CLI Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /certificate add name=selfsigned-149.8.119.2 common-name=149.8.119.2 key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client subject-alt-name=ip:149.8.119.2
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI:**
        *   Go to `System` -> `Certificates`.
        *   Click `Add`.
        *   In the "New Certificate" window, fill the values as follow:
            *   `Name`: selfsigned-149.8.119.2
            *   `Common Name`: 149.8.119.2
            *  `Key Usage`: check all checkboxes except: `ca` and `crl-sign`.
            *  `Subject Alt Name` field: ip:149.8.119.2
        *   Click `Apply`, and a certificate will be generated.
    *   **Expected Output:** The command will create a new certificate, which you can verify in the certificate list. The output should show the status as `K` (key generated) and `T` (trusted, for self-signed certificates). You can also view this information in Winbox.
        ```mikrotik
        /certificate print
        Flags: K - key, L - lcr, T - trusted
         #   NAME                                                  COMMON-NAME   SUBJECT-ALT-NAME           SERIAL-NUMBER     F   EXPIRES-AFTER
         0   selfsigned-149.8.119.2                              149.8.119.2    ip:149.8.119.2           80591914695D... KT  1y
        ```

3. **Step 3: Configure service to use the generated certificate.**
   *   **Purpose:** Now configure a service to use the generated certificate. In this case we will configure the API service to use TLS and use the generated certificate.
   *   **Action:** Modify API service configuration to use the generated certificate.
   *   **CLI Example:**
   ```mikrotik
    /ip service set api-ssl certificate=selfsigned-149.8.119.2
    /ip service enable api-ssl
   ```
   * **Winbox GUI:**
       * Go to IP -> Services
       * Select `api-ssl` and set the Certificate to `selfsigned-149.8.119.2`.
       * Enable the `api-ssl` service
   *   **Expected Output:** The API service will now listen to HTTPS connections, serving the configured certificate. 
    ```mikrotik
    /ip service print
    Flags: X - disabled
     #   NAME                      PORT  ADDRESS                CERTIFICATE         CIPHERS                                           TLS-VERSION   
     ...
     3   api-ssl                       8729  0.0.0.0/0              selfsigned-149.8.119.2      tls1.2-cipher-lists/modern-tls-cipher-lists       tls1.2
     ...
   ```

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
# Configure an IP address for interface ether-3 (if not already configured)
/ip address add address=149.8.119.2/24 interface=ether-3

# Generate the self-signed certificate
/certificate add name=selfsigned-149.8.119.2 common-name=149.8.119.2 key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,tls-server,tls-client subject-alt-name=ip:149.8.119.2

# Configure API to use TLS and the generated certificate
/ip service set api-ssl certificate=selfsigned-149.8.119.2
/ip service enable api-ssl
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

| Command            | Parameter          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/certificate add` | `name`            | Unique name for the certificate.                                                                               |
|                   | `common-name`     | The CN field in the certificate, typically the hostname or IP address.                                    |
|                   | `key-usage`     |  Specifies the intended usage of the certificate's key, in this case the certificate can be used for a TLS server or TLS client. |
|                   | `subject-alt-name` | Specifies a list of alternative names, such as IP addresses that should be valid for this certificate. |
| `/ip service set` | `api-ssl` | Specifies the service to configure                                                                 |
|                   | `certificate`        | Sets the certificate that the service should use.                                                            |
| `/ip service enable` | `api-ssl` | enables the specified service.                                                                 |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Certificate not trusted:** If you are accessing a service with this self-signed certificate, you will see the "Not Secure" warning on your browser. This is expected for self-signed certificates. You can ignore the warning or import the certificate into your device's trusted certificate store to get rid of the warning.
*   **Key usage:** Ensuring the `key-usage` parameter is set correctly is crucial. If you do not select `tls-server` and `tls-client` your service might not work as expected.
*   **Certificate Mismatch:** Ensure the `common-name` or `subject-alt-name` match the domain or IP address used to access the service or the tunnel. Otherwise, you will get a warning about hostname mismatch.
*   **Certificate Expiry:** Keep in mind that certificates, even self-signed ones, do expire. The default expiry time for a self-signed certificate is one year, make sure to create a new one, if the expiry date is near.
*   **Incorrect Service Selection:** Double-check you are setting the right service (e.g., `api-ssl`, `www-ssl`, IPSec profile) to use the certificate. If you are configuring other services, like IPSec tunnels, make sure you are referencing the correct certificate.
* **Certificate not available** If the certificate status isn't K T (key generated and trusted) check the `/certificate print` command.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Verify Certificate Generation:** Check `/certificate print` output. Ensure the new certificate appears with the flag "KT".
2.  **Access webfig/api via HTTPS:** In a browser try to navigate to `https://149.8.119.2`. If your service is configured, you should be able to access your MikroTik using HTTPS and a self-signed certificate. You might have to accept the warning about self signed certificates. If you configure the API service, you can connect via a specific API tool using HTTPS with the defined credentials.
3.  **API Connectivity:** Use any API client to connect to the router on the defined port via HTTPS. You will need to ignore certificate warnings or load the certificate to your client if necessary.
4.  **Torch:** Use the torch tool to verify that HTTPS traffic is going to the configured port (if configured for API: port 8729 for API-SSL, or 443 for webfig)
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=ether-3 src-address=149.8.119.2 dst-port=8729 protocol=tcp
    ```

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs):** In more complex setups, especially in corporate environments, consider using CRLs to revoke compromised certificates. This functionality is present in RouterOS for externally signed certificates.
*   **Let's Encrypt:** For publicly accessible routers, using Let's Encrypt is a much more secure and user-friendly option compared to self-signed certificates. RouterOS supports Let's Encrypt via the `acme` feature.
*   **IPSec Certificate Authentication:** For IPsec tunnels, certificates are commonly used for authentication. You would select your certificate for the respective IPsec profile.
*   **Multiple Certificates:** RouterOS can manage multiple certificates, which is useful when having different services that needs to use different certificates.
*   **Exporting and Importing certificates:** You can export the certificate and its key for backup purposes or to use it in another device.

    *   Authentication failures will result in a `401 Unauthorized`.
    *   If a certificate with the name `selfsigned-149.8.119.3` already exists when executing example 2, the API will return a `409` error code.
    *   If the certificate is not available when executing example 3, the API will return a `500` error code.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Protect API Credentials:** Always use strong passwords for your API user.
*   **Limit API Access:** If possible, restrict API access to specific IP addresses using firewall rules.
*   **Regular Certificate Rotation:** Remember to rotate your certificates periodically to enhance security.
*   **Use of Strong Ciphers:** RouterOS allows you to configure allowed ciphers and the TLS version on a per service base. Make sure you are using a modern configuration.
*   **Avoid Exporting Certificates:** Avoid exporting the private key of the certificate if it's not needed, and treat it with utmost care.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Automated Certificate Renewal:**  This setup uses self-signed certificates that expire, and renewal must be manual. The use of Let's Encrypt or an internal CA would automate this.
*   **Backup Strategy:** This guide doesn't cover backup of certificates and keys. A robust backup plan is crucial.
*   **Detailed Key Usage:** While we selected commonly used key usages, this can be further refined for each certificate's specific use.
*   **Logging:** More advanced logging for certificate-related activities could be beneficial.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

Certificates in RouterOS, using X.509 standard, serve several purposes. They establish trust between parties for secure communication. When using a self-signed certificate, you are effectively becoming your own Certificate Authority. While this is suitable for private networks or development, it does not establish "trust" in the same way that a publicly trusted certificate would. The trade-off is that it requires no external dependency, and is free and convenient for internal use. The certificate includes a public key and is signed by its associated private key. Clients can use the certificate to verify the identity of the server/router and also to establish an encrypted communication channel.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Self-Signed Certificates vs. Publicly Signed Certificates:** Self-signed certificates are easier to generate and don't cost anything, but they will trigger warnings in browsers and clients as they are not trusted by default. Publicly signed certificates require a Certificate Authority (like Let's Encrypt) but are trusted by most devices. The trade-off is convenience vs. security/trust.
*   **Key Usage:** Restricting the key usage makes a certificate less flexible but increases security. The `key-usage` parameter defines the type of cryptographic operations the key can perform.  If a specific certificate is only for a server, you shouldn't include client authentication, for instance.
*   **Algorithm Choice:**  RouterOS supports several algorithms like RSA, ECDSA for key generation. Each algorithm offers trade-offs in security and performance. RSA is well-supported but computationally intensive, while ECDSA offers higher performance with the same security.
*   **TLS Version and Ciphers:** Setting the appropriate TLS version and ciphers to use is paramount. TLS 1.2 and modern ciphers provide better security than outdated ones. This is a tradeoff between performance and security, but, for most use-cases, choosing a higher security configuration is preferred.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is generally compatible with RouterOS 6.48 and all 7.x versions.
