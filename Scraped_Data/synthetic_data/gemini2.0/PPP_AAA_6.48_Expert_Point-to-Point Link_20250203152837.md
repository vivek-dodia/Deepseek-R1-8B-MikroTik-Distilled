Okay, let's dive deep into configuring PPP AAA on a MikroTik router running RouterOS 6.48, specifically focusing on a point-to-point link using a bridge interface.

## Scenario Description:

We're setting up a point-to-point link between two MikroTik routers using PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE).  One router will act as the PPPoE server and the other as the PPPoE client. We will use a bridge interface on the PPPoE server side (`bridge-27`) and will configure the PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) to control access to the network and to allow dynamic IP allocation within the `88.69.142.0/24` subnet. This setup might be used to connect two sites, providing a secure and managed connection between them.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure this setup on the PPPoE *server* MikroTik router. The PPPoE client configuration will be provided in "Complete Configuration Commands" section.

**Before Starting:**
1.  Ensure your MikroTik router is running RouterOS 6.48 or later.
2.  You have a working network interface that will participate in the bridge-27 (e.g., `ether1`).
3.  You have Winbox access or terminal access to the router.

**Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface (`bridge-27`)**

   *   **Explanation:** A bridge interface will act as a Layer 2 switch, allowing Ethernet frames to pass between multiple interfaces. We'll add the physical Ethernet interface that will act as our PPPoE Server endpoint to the bridge.

   *   **CLI Command (Before):**

      ```mikrotik
      /interface print
      ```

      *Example Output:*
      ```
      Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, R - running, S - slave
      #     NAME                                TYPE      MTU   L2MTU  MAX-L2MTU
      0  R  ether1                              ether     1500  1598   4074
      1  R  ether2                              ether     1500  1598   4074
      2  R  wlan1                               wlan      1500  1598   1598
      ```

   *   **CLI Command (Execute):**

      ```mikrotik
      /interface bridge add name=bridge-27
      /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-27 interface=ether1
      ```

   *   **CLI Command (After):**

      ```mikrotik
      /interface print
      /interface bridge print
      /interface bridge port print
      ```

      *Example Output (interface print)*:
      ```
       Flags: D - dynamic, X - disabled, R - running, S - slave
      #     NAME                                TYPE      MTU   L2MTU  MAX-L2MTU
      0  R  ether1                              ether     1500  1598   4074
      1  R  ether2                              ether     1500  1598   4074
      2  R  wlan1                               wlan      1500  1598   1598
      3  R  bridge-27                           bridge    1500  1598   4074
      ```

       *Example Output (bridge print)*:

      ```
      Flags: X - disabled, R - running
      #   NAME      MTU   L2MTU  ARP    MAC-ADDRESS      ADMIN-MAC     MAX-MESSAGE-SIZE
      0 R bridge-27 1500  1598   enabled  6C:3B:6B:47:E5:11 6C:3B:6B:47:E5:11   1023
      ```

       *Example Output (bridge port print)*:
      ```
      Flags: X - disabled, I - inactive, D - dynamic, H - hw-offload
      #    BRIDGE    INTERFACE         PRIORITY  PATH-COST  HORIZON  FRAME-TYPES  EDGE  AUTO-EDGE   PVID  H-
      0  bridge-27 ether1                  128         10         none           admit   yes         auto     1
      ```

   *   **Effect:**  A new bridge interface named `bridge-27` is created and `ether1` is added as a member port. Now traffic entering `ether1` will be passed through the bridge.

**Step 2: Configure the IP Pool**

   *   **Explanation:** We need an IP address pool to assign dynamic IP addresses to PPPoE clients.

   *   **CLI Command (Before):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ip pool print
      ```

       *Example Output (empty pools)*:
      ```
      /ip pool
      ```

   *   **CLI Command (Execute):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ip pool add name=ppp-pool ranges=88.69.142.100-88.69.142.200
      ```
   *  **CLI Command (After):**
      ```mikrotik
      /ip pool print
      ```
      *Example Output*:
      ```
      #   NAME     RANGES                                                                
      0   ppp-pool 88.69.142.100-88.69.142.200
      ```

   *   **Effect:** An IP address pool named `ppp-pool` is created. This pool contains IP addresses ranging from `88.69.142.100` to `88.69.142.200`.

**Step 3: Configure the PPP Profile**

   *   **Explanation:** A PPP profile defines the authentication settings, address pools and other configuration for PPP connections, including PPPoE.

   *   **CLI Command (Before):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp profile print
      ```

      *Example Output (default profiles)*:

       ```
       Flags: * - default
       #   NAME                                 LOCAL-ADDRESS      REMOTE-ADDRESS     USE-ENCRYPTION    
       0  * default                                                            yes
       ```

   *   **CLI Command (Execute):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp profile add name=ppp-profile local-address=88.69.142.1 interface=bridge-27 use-encryption=required dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4  remote-address=ppp-pool
      ```
    * **CLI Command (After):**

       ```mikrotik
       /ppp profile print
      ```
       *Example Output*:
       ```
       Flags: * - default
       #   NAME                                 LOCAL-ADDRESS      REMOTE-ADDRESS     USE-ENCRYPTION  
       0  * default                                                            yes           
       1    ppp-profile                        88.69.142.1          ppp-pool            required
       ```

   *   **Effect:** A PPP profile named `ppp-profile` is created with following parameters:
       * `local-address` is set to `88.69.142.1`
       * The bridge interface `bridge-27` is bound to this profile
       * `use-encryption` is set to `required` meaning encryption is required
       * DNS server is added to the profile for client consumption
       * `remote-address` is set to `ppp-pool` meaning clients will get an IP from the pool when they connect.

**Step 4: Configure the PPPoE Server**

   *   **Explanation:** This step creates a PPPoE server on the previously created bridge interface.

   *   **CLI Command (Before):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp server print
      ```
       *Example Output (empty server list)*:
       ```
       /ppp server
       ```

   *   **CLI Command (Execute):**
      ```mikrotik
      /ppp server add service-name=pppoe-service interface=bridge-27 profile=ppp-profile max-mtu=1480 max-mru=1480
      ```
   * **CLI Command (After):**

       ```mikrotik
       /ppp server print
       ```
        *Example Output:*
      ```
       Flags: X - disabled
       #   INTERFACE   SERVICE-NAME      PROFILE      MAX-MTU  MAX-MRU
       0   bridge-27   pppoe-service     ppp-profile   1480     1480
       ```
   *   **Effect:** A PPPoE server is configured, listening on the `bridge-27` interface using the configuration defined in the `ppp-profile`, and maximum MTU and MRU of 1480. This server will wait for PPPoE client connections on the bridge interface.

**Step 5: Create a Secret (User/Password)**

   *   **Explanation:** We need to create a user and password that the PPPoE client will use to connect to the server.

   *   **CLI Command (Before):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp secret print
      ```
      *Example Output (empty secrets list):*
      ```
      /ppp secret
      ```

   *   **CLI Command (Execute):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp secret add name=pppoe-user password=securepassword service=pppoe-service profile=ppp-profile
      ```
   *   **CLI Command (After):**

      ```mikrotik
      /ppp secret print
      ```
       *Example Output:*
      ```
      Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
      #   NAME     SERVICE    PROFILE     LOCAL-ADDRESS   REMOTE-ADDRESS    
      0   pppoe-user pppoe-service ppp-profile
      ```

   *   **Effect:**  A user named `pppoe-user` is created with the password `securepassword`, associated with the `pppoe-service` and the  `ppp-profile`. This username and password will be required by a client to connect.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the complete set of commands for the PPPoE server router:

```mikrotik
# Create Bridge Interface
/interface bridge add name=bridge-27
/interface bridge port add bridge=bridge-27 interface=ether1

# Create IP Pool
/ip pool add name=ppp-pool ranges=88.69.142.100-88.69.142.200

# Create PPP Profile
/ppp profile add name=ppp-profile local-address=88.69.142.1 interface=bridge-27 use-encryption=required dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 remote-address=ppp-pool

# Create PPPoE Server
/ppp server add service-name=pppoe-service interface=bridge-27 profile=ppp-profile max-mtu=1480 max-mru=1480

# Create Secret (Username/Password)
/ppp secret add name=pppoe-user password=securepassword service=pppoe-service profile=ppp-profile
```
Here's the complete configuration for the PPPoE *client* router:
```mikrotik
# Configure the Interface
/interface pppoe-client add name=pppoe-out1 user=pppoe-user password=securepassword interface=ether2 use-peer-dns=yes
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Authentication Failures:**
    *   **Problem:** Client cannot connect, error messages indicate authentication failure.
    *   **Solution:**  Double-check the username and password on the client and server. Ensure the service name in the secret matches the server configuration.
*   **IP Address Issues:**
    *   **Problem:**  Client gets no IP address, or an incorrect IP address.
    *   **Solution:**  Verify the IP pool configuration, the IP range, and the PPPoE profile's `remote-address` setting. Ensure that the pool's IP address range does not overlap with other used addresses.
*   **MTU/MRU Mismatches:**
    *   **Problem:**  Connectivity issues, packet fragmentation or poor performance.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure MTU and MRU values on both the server and client match, or at least are compatible. 1480 is a common value for PPPoE as the PPPoE header takes up 8 bytes.
*   **Encryption Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Client can not connect, or the connection is not secure as expected
    *   **Solution:** Ensure both the client and server `use-encryption` setting match. When set to "required" encryption is always needed.
*   **Interface Mismatch:**
    *   **Problem:** The PPPoE server does not answer connection requests or the client cannot connect.
    *   **Solution:** Double check the bridge interface name in the server settings, and make sure the correct physical interface was added to the bridge. Also double check that the correct physical interface is configured for the PPPoE client on the client router.
*   **Resource Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** High CPU usage on the server router.
    *   **Solution:**  Monitor CPU usage, and if it is consistently high, you might have to consider a more powerful router or optimize the configuration. The PPP process is resource intensive on low-end hardware.
* **Security issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Poor Password Management.
    *   **Solution:** Use very strong passwords and enforce password management policies. Use a strong random password generator and keep the secrets in a secure place. Consider password management best practices, do not reuse passwords.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Client Connectivity:** After configuring both the PPPoE server and client, check that the client router establishes a PPP connection. In the server router, use:

    ```mikrotik
    /ppp active print
    ```
    This should list any active PPP connections, including user and IP address information.
2.  **Ping Test:** From the PPPoE client, ping the server's local address (`88.69.142.1`).

    ```mikrotik
    /ping 88.69.142.1
    ```
    A successful ping confirms basic connectivity.
3.  **Traceroute Test:**  From the PPPoE client, use traceroute to confirm the client is passing through the correct path.

    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 8.8.8.8
    ```
    This should show you the hops your packets are taking.
4.  **Torch:** Use torch on the server's bridge interface to observe PPPoE traffic and ensure traffic is passing as expected.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=bridge-27
    ```
5.  **Interface Status:**  Check the client's interface status in the `interface print` to make sure it is running and shows an IP address. Also ensure that a valid route was created.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route print
    ```
6. **Logging:** Check the server and client logs for PPP related error messages

    ```mikrotik
    /log print topic=ppp
    ```
    This will help in diagnosing authentication errors and other issues.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Bandwidth Control:** You can use MikroTik's queues to limit bandwidth per PPPoE user or on the total PPPoE interface.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Add firewall rules to protect your networks, control traffic between the PPPoE clients and other networks.
*   **Hotspot:** This method can be used in combination with the MikroTik hotspot to create a secure and managed hotspot solution.
*   **Radius AAA:**  Replace the local secret with a Radius server for more centralized user management and accounting.
*   **VPN:** You could establish an encrypted tunnel (e.g. IPSec) over this PPP link if the encryption provided by the PPP connection is not enough, or for multi-factor authentication.
*   **Monitoring:** Setup SNMP to monitor the status of the PPP link, number of active sessions, and bandwidth utilization.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

The MikroTik REST API can manage most of the setup described using the RouterOS API. The RouterOS API should be enabled first. Assuming the API is enabled, we can interact with it using http.

Here's how you can create a PPPoE secret using the API.

**API Endpoint:** `https://<your_router_ip>/rest/ppp/secret`

**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "name": "api-pppoe-user",
  "password": "api-securepassword",
  "service": "pppoe-service",
  "profile": "ppp-profile"
}
```

**Example `curl` Command:**

```bash
curl -k -u <your_api_user>:<your_api_password> \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"name": "api-pppoe-user", "password": "api-securepassword", "service": "pppoe-service", "profile": "ppp-profile"}' \
     https://<your_router_ip>/rest/ppp/secret
```

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
    "message": "added"
}
```

**Error Handling:**

If there is an issue with the request (e.g. missing fields, already existing user) the server will respond with an error:

```json
{
    "error": "input does not match the schema"
}
```
The response will have error message and relevant codes to help determine the error.

**Note:**
- Replace `<your_router_ip>` with the IP address of your MikroTik router.
- Replace `<your_api_user>` and `<your_api_password>` with a user that has api permissions.
- Always use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Error handling should be part of any API interaction and should check for expected error codes and messages.
- Parameters like 'name', 'password', 'service', and 'profile' are MikroTik specific attributes.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, randomly generated passwords for both the PPPoE secrets and router access.
*   **Limit Access:** Restrict access to the router's management interfaces (Winbox, SSH, API) to authorized IP addresses.
*   **Encryption:** Enable PPP encryption, specifically setting `use-encryption=required`.
*   **Firewall:** Implement firewall rules to protect the router itself and the networks it connects to.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version.
*  **Rate Limit:** Use queues to limit the number of concurrent connections, to mitigate against DoS attacks.
*  **Radius:** If you have many users, use a radius server to centrally manage user access.
*  **MFA:** Use two factor authentication where applicable.
*  **Logging:** Keep detailed logs, and centralize logs to an external server or Syslog.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Current configuration:** The provided configuration is a good starting point for setting up a basic PPPoE point-to-point link, it provides a good balance between security, usability and features.
*   **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Implement more advanced firewall rules specific for PPP traffic.
    *   Add bandwidth control to prevent any single client from consuming too much bandwidth.
    *   Utilize a Radius server to manage users and secrets.
    *   Add more monitoring.
    *   Add a fallback router setup for a High availability environment.
    *   Use specific logging profiles to more granular log ppp related activity, allowing easier debug.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Security is a continuous process that should be frequently reviewed. The setup as is provides good security but more could always be done.
    *   Resource usage of the router, make sure that the router can handle the load, otherwise consider using a more powerful router.
    *   Proper MTU configuration is paramount for performance.
    *   The setup does not handle any kind of user accounting, the accounting should be part of the design if needed.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic

**PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):**

*   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user or device. In the context of PPPoE, this is typically done using usernames and passwords, either stored locally in the router's configuration or through an external RADIUS server.
*   **Authorization:** Determines what resources a user is allowed to access after successful authentication. With PPPoE, this mainly means the IP address assignment but it can also determine what access the user has in the network.
*   **Accounting:** Tracks user activity, such as session duration, bandwidth usage, and other relevant parameters. This is usually achieved with a RADIUS server to monitor and log user activity.

PPP provides a method to connect to a network using a "virtual" connection, where the connection is established by the PPP protocol, over a physical medium like Ethernet. When a PPPoE client initiates the connection, the following process is usually followed:

1. **Discovery:** The client sends out a broadcast message (PADI) to find PPPoE servers
2. **Offer:** The server replies with a PADO message, indicating it can process the request
3. **Request:** The client responds with a PADR message with the name of the service to connect to.
4. **Session:** The server sends a PADS message, initiating the PPP session.
5. **PPP Negotiation:** The client and server negotiate LCP and then IPCP which negotiates IP address and other IP settings
6. **Authentication:** Authentication process is done, by using PAP, CHAP, or MSCHAPv2
7. **Connection:** The connection is established and the client can send and receive data through the virtual connection.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

**Local Secrets vs. RADIUS:**

*   **Local Secrets:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Simple to configure for a small number of users. Does not require any additional hardware or software.
        *   **Cons:** Difficult to manage for a large number of users. Changes to secrets need to be done manually. Does not provide accounting or centralized management.
    *   **When to Use:** For small networks or when an external server is not available. Suitable for testing and small setups.
*   **RADIUS Server:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Centralized user management, flexible policy control, detailed accounting. Ideal for large networks, enterprise environments, or ISP scenarios.
        *   **Cons:**  More complex to set up and requires dedicated hardware or service.
    *   **When to Use:** For large networks, more granular access control, or where centralized user management and accounting is a must.

**PPPoE over Bridge vs. Interface:**

*   **PPPoE over Bridge:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Enables Layer 2 functionality. Allows all traffic (other than just PPPoE) to be forwarded, and avoids complicated routing.
        *   **Cons:** Requires a bridging method, or additional manual IP setup.
    *   **When to Use:** Use when a bridge is the required network configuration. Can be used in situations where an existing bridge needs to be used as an entrypoint for the PPPoE clients.
*   **PPPoE over Physical Interface:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Simpler configuration than using a bridge, simpler routing.
        *   **Cons:** Traffic is contained to a single interface, requires configuration for passing other non PPP traffic, more difficult to use in a bridge configuration.
    *   **When to Use:** When it is not needed to use a bridge for the PPPoE interface.

**MTU/MRU Values:**

*   **Higher MTU/MRU:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Can improve throughput by reducing the overhead of transmitting smaller packets.
        *   **Cons:** Can increase packet fragmentation if not set correctly on all devices. Can cause issues when the underlying transport medium does not support larger packets.
*   **Lower MTU/MRU:**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** Reduces packet fragmentation, more compatibility between different devices and systems.
        *   **Cons:** Lower maximum throughput due to smaller packet sizes, increased overhead.

**Encryption:**

* **`use-encryption=required`**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** High security, encrypts the PPP traffic, preventing eavesdropping.
        *   **Cons:**  Adds complexity and overhead.
* **`use-encryption=yes`**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
       *   **Pros:** Can use encryption if available, does not impose it. Less resource intensive
        *   **Cons:** Insecure if encryption is not negotiated between the peer.
* **`use-encryption=no`**
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   **Pros:** No overhead of encryption.
        *   **Cons:**  Traffic is not encrypted and can be eavesdropped, very insecure.

Choosing the correct setting will be a trade-off between security and resource utilization. For sensitive data traffic, it is always best to use encryption, but if resources are at a premium, it can be a valid trade-off.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is designed for RouterOS 6.48, but is also applicable to RouterOS 7.x. No specific adjustments are needed for RouterOS 7.x. The commands and syntax are compatible between both versions.
