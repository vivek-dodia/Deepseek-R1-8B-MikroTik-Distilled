Hi there!The dhcp-client isn't adding dynamic routes specified by DHCP. Any ideas why? Am I missing something obvious?I've included snippets of what I think is relevant below. Please let mw know if you need more information.Code:Select all/system resource print

Thank you for responding!I would generally agree with you however in the debug output that I showed, the Parameter-List does include Classless-Route (unless I'm misreading the output). Also the documentation seems to indicate an implicit request for classless routes. [https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/DHCP_Client]Just in case, I tested by removing the offending `dhcp-options=hostname,clientid` from the DHCP Client configuration and still didn't get routes set.Any other thoughts or hints?

I removed the dhcp-options from the client configuration because you mentioned them and I hadn't tried that yet. :-) Initially I assumed you were telling me to explicitly add an option to request classless-routes but after re-reading the Mikrotik documentation saw that it's already there and seems unnecessary.I don't have access to the DHCP server to show its configuration but can do a packet capture if the debug information in the original post isn't enough. The server is a Starlink terminal [Dishy McFlatface].Are you thinking that the dhcp-client configuration that I have should be working?

Worth mentioning (it's obvious anyway) that this is regarding Starlink,  maybe @rextended can take a look at the DHCP setting that they are using. Or just ignore the troll.Oh wait, he asked about the configuration of the DNS server, how is that related, beats me.Anyway,Just looking at those classless-routes received you'd see that there's no way those can be set currently on RouterOS. Probably that's why they are silently failing.Why? gateway=0.0.0.0 is an invalid value for .. gateway :) And unless RouterOS makes a translation from 0.0.0.0 -> dhcp_client_interface this will most likely never get fixed.But you can write a ticket anyway, maybe they find a way to handle this.Until then, you can set those two routes static,shouldwork, unless something more is needed:Code:Select all/ip route
add distance=1 dst-address=34.120.255.244/32 gateway=Starlink
add distance=1 dst-address=192.168.100.1/32 gateway=Starlink

Ah, so NOW you took the time to read the details provided in the first post? Instead of asking for the "DNS Server config"...Hence, the troll.PS: good job at editing your replies.PS2: specifying the interface like I wrote above should be ok, as others tested on other routers:https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comme ... &context=3&https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comme ... p_to_work/As in, NOT specifying thedefault gatewayfor those two IPs :)Cheers.Let's see if you'll edit these replies now too..

Thank you, @Znevna, I was pretty sure the configuration was correct. I had assumed that RouterOS would have seen the 0.0.0.0 destination in the classless-route parameter, recognized the default route and set a dynamic route appropriately. Since it doesn't, I thought I had missed something.Incidentally, setting the routes manually with gateway set to the interface has always worked although setting gateway to the IP address does not. Again, I don't have the routing experience to recognize why (or perhaps it's RouterOS packet processing?). Thank you for doing the additional research on Starlink, @Znevna, I probably should have mentioned that in the original post and could have saved you the time. :-/In summary: The RouterOS dhcp-client is configured correctly but doesnotset the classless-routes sent by the Starlink terminal DHCP server. I'll contact Mikrotik support.On a [not really] related note, setting the routes manually works when using the interface as gateway but not the specified IP address [100.127.255.5 in this example]. That's probably a more simple well understood problem related to basic IP routing. :-) If you feel like explaining it I'd appreciate it but otherwise not to worry. I'll get to it eventually for my own education. This is partly related to @rextended stating that 192.168.100.1 and 34.120.255.244 should already be covered by 0.0.0.0. I would have agreed except it doesn't work. :-oThanks again for taking the time to respond.

Probably 192.168.100.1 are added for force the phone app to work everytime,ignoring all the mess you can do on the config.Starlink proprietary router can understand those two routes also for Starlink captive portal (34.120.255.244 my.starlink.com)The differences between:192.168.100.1->WAN interface = search 192.168.100.1 inside the device himself192.168.100.1->GatewayIP = search 192.168.100.1, passing by gateway, on the other side of the connection(please try to understood I try to explain it from Italian)obviously when I haved  see 192.168.100.1/32->0.0.0.0 I do not have noticed the missing detail at the end: /0 !!!0.0.0.0/0 = any IPv40.0.0.0 = means that no intermediate routing hops are necessary because the system is directly connected to the destination (MikroTik do not understand this)@Znevna please consider the option to not consider me one troll, please.

Thank you, @Znevna, [...]In summary: The RouterOS dhcp-client is configured correctly but doesnotset the classless-routes sent by the Starlink terminal DHCP server. I'll contact Mikrotik support.[...]Welcome! Yeah, I wrote above why those two routes won't register, you can try manually and see the error msg. (and a typo):Code:Select all/ip route add dst-address=192.168.100.1 gateway=0.0.0.0
failure: Invalid route configuration: Invalid gateway configrationAnd the only (easy) fix I can think of is also the one mentioned above, if they somehow translate "gateway=0.0.0.0" to "gateway=interface_of_current_dhcp_client" before adding the routes received.Or if Starlink finds another way to do this.Regarding why specifying the default gateway doesn't work .. well.. that's what you're trying to avoid, and by specifying it again is just redundant.

[quote @Znevna] Regarding why specifying the default gateway doesn't work .. well.. that's what you're trying to avoid[/quote]LOL of course! :-o@rextended, don't worry about the script unless it's an exercise for yourself. I see what you're doing and it makes sense. This is residential and setting the routes manually is fine, I was just trying to figure out why the dhcp-client wasn't working. I may write the script myself for learning purposes (but probably not soon).If anyone is still reading and interested, the router that Starlink supplies is apparently a customized OpenWRT however it is not accessible by the user at this time. Simply removing it and connecting your own router to the terminal [dishy] works fine. I have connected an RB4011iGS+ and [controversially?] use a Mikrotik Audience for WiFi as well as a CRS326-24G-2S+.Thanks again!
