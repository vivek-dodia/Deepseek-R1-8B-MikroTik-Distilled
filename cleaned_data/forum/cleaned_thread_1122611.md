## Initial Question
HelloI wanted to post this in the "Winbox4 is here" thread, but I cant. I guess that is because Iâ€™m new here and does not have any post history yet.As someone who is new to Mikrotik and just setting up my first wAP-ax, I would find it more logical if the Frequency under Channel on the wifi interfaces was an dropdown where you can choose an frequency and the list only shown the ones that is allowed based on the country you set.I saw an video by "The Network Berg" on Youtube where he had an drop down for this in Winbox3 so it looks like this was the way before.I like how the Band and Channel Width is an drop down box ---

## Response 1
I like how the Band and Channel Width is an drop down boxBut there is a problem there too ...Except for wAP AX (that one I know for sure) and some limited other models, none of MT devices can use 160MHz channel width.Yet it shows for every device where you open that channel width box.I understand the request and info is there (you can pull up radio capabilities, so the limitations are known).Maybe file a support ticket for it ?This is a user forum, users helping users.MT staff does come by from time to time but not everyone and certainly not everywhere.A support ticket makes sure your request gets (at least some) attention. ---
