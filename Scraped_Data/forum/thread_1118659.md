Hi all!Where can I find this software to install on my hAP-ax3? When I download the "extra packages" archive from the download page, I cannot find it? Doesn't Capsman run on one of your devices?Thanks and kind regards,Patrick

In ROS 7 capsman integrated into wifi menu. You can set it in wifi configuration with option manager.
