Hi all,I've 2 devices, an L009UiGS-2HaxD with CAPsMAN enabled with 2 cfg for 2ghz and 5Ghz 802.11ax radios and a C53UiG+5HPaxD2HPaxD with CAP client enabled.The client connects to the capsman but no radio are listed in the proper section. The other strange thing is that on remote CAP i see the device connected but with no IP.(on IP -> Neighbors i see that device with the IP, BTW these devices are on the same subnet)Screenshot 2024-02-19 alle 01.56.29.jpgAny idea on what's happening?It's the 1st wifi-qcom and capsman configuration.With past wireless and capsman i never seen this kind of problem.

Have you tried clearing out all certificates ?

Have you tried clearing out all certificates ?yes, I've tried also to leave default (blank) on Cert and CA fields with the same result.Question: the CAP client hasn't a cert and doesn't generate a new one. I've to create it manually and set on Wifi -> CAP settings?

Personally I don't use certificates.I don't see the benefit from using it in my own LAN environment.

please see the attached video.There is no video attached (yet).Could you please share both configs of CAPS and of CAPsMAN?Remove serial and any other personal information. If you post the config in between code tags (by using the </> button) it will be more readable.

My suggestions:1) disable CAP mode on main2) apply cfg1 to interface wifi1 on main3) disable detect internet on main4) disable capsman on AP15) remove "certificate=request" on cap configuration of AP1Probably, resetting AP1 to CAP mode is the best option (instead of points 4-5).And please remember that L009UiGS does not have 5GHz radio, AFAIK.

Side note: the L009 is much less powerful than the hAP ax3. Have you considered to switch the two device roles?

Side note: the L009 is much less powerful than the hAP ax3. Have you considered to switch the two device roles?to be honest i've already tried to switch role of 2 RBs with same result.I've done video and config dump when in the 2nd scenario but doesn't matter at the moment.The main problem is that new wifi CAPsMAN is not working following official wiki.

My goal is to make wifi-qcom CAPsMAN working for adding more HAP ax3 with one as CAPsMAN Main and other 2 pcs as CAP clients.

To properly troubleshoot problems it is often useful to reduce potential factors that interferes.We are trying to help and I never got you were not interested in configuring wifi on L009.My impression is that your config lacks of provisioning rules.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... iFiCAPsMAN

I never told that this is the final scenario.My final config has 3 x HAP ax3 and 1 x L009In that case you definitely need those provisioning rules and ideally even per radio mac address to steer correct frequency setting for each of those APs (other options also possible. I find MAC address to be the easiest way to be sure what goes where).PS official help pages do show all this.Are you sure you are looking at the correct page ?https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ ... iFiCAPsMAN

The structure of the command gives you the hint about where the option is located. However, seehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37aff6d14Xkminute 4.00 onwards.Let me point out that you were following the wrong page (old CAPsMAN). The right help page is the one I linked before.I warmly suggest you to reset to CAPS mode (same youtube video, at minute ~3.00) your future APs.PS: You probably want to mark the topic as resolved.

Secondly, you probably missed the following part on the CAP:I just set up my first new Capsman (wifi-qcom) and found that when I set the configuration manager to capsman, when the radios provision, each caps controlled entry makes a second copy of the local radio entry, and the wifi radios never transmit. I even verified the/interface wifi print detailand the config is correct. The only way I was able to get it to work was to set the configuration explicitly to "local" and then reprovision the radios. At that point the ghost entries disappear and the radios work again.Anyone have the same problem with duplicate radio entries and wifi not transmitting?[Update]: I currently only have one CAP for evaluation, so I am running Capsman on the CAP.

Provisioning local radios via local capsman works differently. You use "/interface/wifi/radio/print" to lookup local radios, these are marked with "L". Usually 0 and 1. Then issue "/interface/wifi/radio/provision 0,1" and now your local radios are under local capsman control. This is AFAIK the correct way.

RadioProvisioningCAPsMAN cannot manage it's own wifi interfaces using configuration.manager=capsman,it is enough to just set the same configuration profile on local interfaces manually as you would with provisioning rules, and the end result will be the same as if they were CAPs. That being said, it is also possible to provision local interfaces via /interface/wifi/radio menu, it should be noted that to regain control of local interfaces after provisioning, you will need to disable the matching provisioning rules and press "provision" again, which will return local interfaces to an unconfigured state.

Foolish me read theCAPSMANdocumentation. I should have been reading theWiFidocumentation.What is important is that I have Capsman/Caps set up so the router shows up under the wifi->steering->neighbor groups for roaming. And I found that it indeed does even if the radios are not directly controlled by Capsman.
