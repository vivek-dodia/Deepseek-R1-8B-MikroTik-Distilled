Okay, let's dive deep into configuring users and user groups on MikroTik RouterOS 6.48 (and compatible with 7.x). This is a crucial aspect of managing access to your router and its features, especially in enterprise environments.

## Scenario Description:

This scenario involves creating and managing user accounts with different access levels on a MikroTik router. We'll use a bridge interface called `bridge-53`, which is part of the 253.45.15.0/24 subnet.  We'll create two user groups: one for read-only access (`read-only`) and another for full administrative control (`full-control`). We will then create specific users and assign them to these groups.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide, explaining each command and its effect:

**1. Step 1: Initial Setup and Interface Check:**

*   **Goal:** Verify that the `bridge-53` interface exists and is operational.
*   **CLI Command (Before):**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge print
    ```
    * This command lists all configured bridge interfaces.
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
    Flags: X - disabled, R - running
    0  R name="bridge1" mtu=1500 actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=1598 arp=enabled
         mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:01 protocol-mode=rstp priority=0x8000
         transmit-queue=default comment=""
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `Bridge` > `Interfaces` to verify if `bridge-53` exists. If not, create it.
*   **Action:** We're going to use the existing bridge for this example. If `bridge-53` does not exist, create it as follows:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge add name=bridge-53
    ```
*   **CLI Command (After):**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface bridge print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
    Flags: X - disabled, R - running
    0  R name="bridge1" mtu=1500 actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=1598 arp=enabled
         mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:01 protocol-mode=rstp priority=0x8000
         transmit-queue=default comment=""
    1  R name="bridge-53" mtu=1500 actual-mtu=1500 l2mtu=1598 arp=enabled
        mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:02 protocol-mode=none priority=0x8000
        transmit-queue=default comment=""
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** `Bridge` > `Interfaces`, you should see `bridge-53` in the list.
*   **Effect:** This step ensures we have a network interface ready for management.

**2. Step 2: Create User Group `read-only`:**

*   **Goal:** Define a user group with restricted access.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group add name=read-only policy=read
    ```
*   **Parameter Explanation:**
    *   `name=read-only`:  Specifies the name of the user group.
    *   `policy=read`:  Defines the access rights for members of this group, limiting them to read access only.
*   **CLI Command (After):**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
    #   NAME      POLICY
    0   read-only  read
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `System` > `Users` > `Groups`. The new group will be listed there.
*   **Effect:** A group `read-only` is created with read-only permissions.

**3. Step 3: Create User Group `full-control`:**

*   **Goal:** Define a user group with full access.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group add name=full-control policy=write,test,password,read,reboot,policy,ftp,web,winbox,local,telnet,ssh
    ```
*   **Parameter Explanation:**
    *   `name=full-control`: Specifies the name of the user group.
    *   `policy=write,test,password,read,reboot,policy,ftp,web,winbox,local,telnet,ssh`: Defines the access rights. `write` allows changes, `test` allows testing configurations, `password` to change passwords, `reboot` to reboot the router, `policy` to manage policies, `ftp,web,winbox,local,telnet,ssh` grants access to all services.
*   **CLI Command (After):**
    ```mikrotik
    /user group print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
    #   NAME        POLICY
    0   read-only  read
    1   full-control  write,test,password,read,reboot,policy,ftp,web,winbox,local,telnet,ssh
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:**  `System` > `Users` > `Groups`. The group will be listed.
*   **Effect:** A group `full-control` is created with full administrative permissions.

**4. Step 4: Create User `john.doe` (Read-only):**

*   **Goal:** Create a user and assign it to the `read-only` group.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=john.doe password="P@$$wOrd123" group=read-only
    ```
*   **Parameter Explanation:**
    *   `name=john.doe`: Specifies the username.
    *   `password="P@$$wOrd123"`: Sets the password for the user.  **Important:** Use a strong password!
    *   `group=read-only`:  Assigns this user to the `read-only` group.
*   **CLI Command (After):**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
    #   NAME      GROUP      DISABLED
    0   admin   full       no
    1   john.doe read-only   no
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** `System` > `Users`, the new user will be listed.
*   **Effect:** User `john.doe` is created and has read-only access.

**5. Step 5: Create User `admin.user` (Full Control):**

*   **Goal:** Create a user and assign it to the `full-control` group.
*   **CLI Command:**
    ```mikrotik
    /user add name=admin.user password="Adm1nP@$$" group=full-control
    ```
*   **Parameter Explanation:**
    *   `name=admin.user`: Specifies the username.
    *   `password="Adm1nP@$$"`: Sets the password. **Important:** Use a strong password!
    *   `group=full-control`: Assigns this user to the `full-control` group.
*   **CLI Command (After):**
    ```mikrotik
    /user print
    ```
*   **Expected Output (Example):**
    ```
     #   NAME        GROUP         DISABLED
    0   admin       full          no
    1   john.doe    read-only     no
    2   admin.user  full-control  no
    ```
*   **Winbox GUI:** `System` > `Users`, the new user will be listed.
*   **Effect:** User `admin.user` is created and has full administrative access.

**6. Step 6: Testing with Different Access Levels**

*   **Goal:** Verify the access restrictions work as expected.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Test 1:** Attempt to connect to the router via Winbox, ssh, or telnet using the username `john.doe` and password. You should be able to log in but you will be restricted from making configuration changes. You can read the configuration but cannot make any alterations. You will be unable to use tools such as `/system reboot`.
    *   **Test 2:**  Attempt to log in with the username `admin.user`. You should be able to perform all actions, including configuration changes, reboots etc.
*   **Effect:**  The user restrictions are validated.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the complete set of commands for your convenience:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge add name=bridge-53
/user group add name=read-only policy=read
/user group add name=full-control policy=write,test,password,read,reboot,policy,ftp,web,winbox,local,telnet,ssh
/user add name=john.doe password="P@$$wOrd123" group=read-only
/user add name=admin.user password="Adm1nP@$$" group=full-control
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Pitfall:**  Forgetting passwords for user accounts.
    *   **Solution:** Keep track of passwords in a secure location. Consider using a password manager. If you lose access to all of your administrative accounts, use netinstall to reload the OS.
*   **Pitfall:**  Accidentally locking yourself out by making incorrect group policy changes.
    *   **Solution:** Connect via serial console if necessary. You can access the console from a wired connection to the router. Also have a backup configuration file so you can revert if needed.
*   **Pitfall:**  Using weak passwords.
    *   **Solution:**  Enforce complex password policies and consider using tools that help generate strong passwords.
*   **Pitfall:**  Creating a user without a group and then not being able to change the group.
    *   **Solution:** If you create a user without a group, that user will have no privileges. The group can be modified later. If you log in as that user, it will appear that the router is not working.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

*   **`ping`:** Ping the router's IP address on the `bridge-53` interface from a host within that subnet. (Remember to configure the appropriate IP address on the `bridge-53`). For example if the IP address of the bridge is `253.45.15.1`:
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 253.45.15.1
    ```
*   **Winbox Connection:** Use the newly created accounts `john.doe` and `admin.user` to log in and verify that the group permissions are correct.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):**  MikroTik supports AAA servers (like RADIUS) for centralized user management.
*   **User Session Management:** Use `/system user active` to monitor currently logged-in users.
    ```mikrotik
    /system user active print
    ```
*   **Hotspot Users:**  You can create users specific for hotspot access.
*   **SSH Keys:** You can use SSH keys for added security rather than just passwords.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

While direct user management through the REST API isn't fully exposed, you can manage users indirectly through scripting or other mechanisms.  For example, you can fetch user information:

```
# API Endpoint to fetch user list (Example)
GET /system/user

# Expected Response (JSON)
[
  {
    "name": "admin",
    "group": "full",
    "disabled": "no"
   },
   {
    "name": "john.doe",
    "group": "read-only",
    "disabled": "no"
   },
   {
    "name": "admin.user",
    "group": "full-control",
    "disabled": "no"
   }
 ]
```

**Note:** For more complex user management, you'd generally use a scripting approach or work through the RouterOS API with more specific calls.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use complex passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Least Privilege:** Assign only the necessary permissions to users. Avoid granting full access where it is not needed.
*   **Regular Audits:** Review user accounts and group permissions periodically.
*   **Disable Default Accounts:** If you do not need the default `admin` user, disable it.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

This configuration is a solid starting point for user management.  However, these are improvements:

*   **Automated User Creation:** Use MikroTik scripting to automate the user creation and management if there are many users.
*   **RADIUS Integration:** Use a RADIUS server for centralized user management, especially in larger deployments.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  If available, integrate with a 2FA solution for extra security.
*   **IP Access Lists:** Use `/ip firewall filter` to limit where each user can connect from. For example, you could limit access to the router management interface to specific subnets.
*   **Scheduled User Password Changes:** Consider implementing a script that automatically changes user passwords on a defined schedule.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic:

User and user groups in MikroTik RouterOS provide a fundamental way to control who can access and manage the device. Users represent individual accounts with specific usernames and passwords, while groups are used to categorize users based on their access needs. Group policy controls what functions the user can access. This approach simplifies administration by making it easier to manage the access level for multiple users.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Individual User Permissions vs. Group Permissions:**  Configuring permissions on a per-user basis can become complex for larger networks. Groups allow you to manage permissions more efficiently.
*   **Complexity vs. Security:**  More granular control over user access provides better security but also increases the complexity of the setup.
*   **Local vs. Remote Authentication:** Using local authentication is simpler but doesn't scale well.  Remote authentication (e.g., RADIUS) is more scalable but requires extra infrastructure.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The above instructions apply to both RouterOS 6.48 and 7.x. The main features and parameters for user management have remained mostly consistent between these versions.

This comprehensive guide covers a lot of ground. You now have a clear, actionable plan to implement user and group management on your MikroTik router, complete with security considerations and troubleshooting advice.
