Okay, let's craft a comprehensive technical document for managing users and user groups on a MikroTik RouterOS device, specifically targeting a point-to-point link scenario on RouterOS 6.48 (while noting compatibility with 7.x).

## Scenario Description:

This document outlines how to configure users and user groups on a MikroTik router, specifically for a point-to-point link scenario.  The router has an interface named `vlan-94` configured with a subnet of `89.142.203.0/24`. We will create a user group with specific access rights and assign users to that group. This is useful for controlling who has access to the router and what they can do.

## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Initial State

Before we begin, it's important to know what users and groups already exist. The default MikroTik router has an admin user and no groups by default.

**CLI Command and Output Example (Before):**

```mikrotik
/user print
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flags  Name    Group           Last Access
       admin   full             never
```

```mikrotik
/user group print
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flags  Name    Policy
```

**Explanation:**

- `/user print`: This shows all users configured on the router. We see the default `admin` user with the `full` access group.
- `/user group print`:  This command lists configured user groups. As expected, there are no user groups configured yet.

### Step 2: Create a New User Group

We'll create a new user group named `vlan94-users` and provide a limited policy to manage `vlan-94` and view the interfaces.

**CLI Command:**
```mikrotik
/user group add name=vlan94-users policy=read,test,write,interface
```

**Explanation:**

- `/user group add`:  This command creates a new user group.
    - `name=vlan94-users`: Specifies the name of the new group.
    - `policy=read,test,write,interface`: Defines permissions for the group.
        - `read`: Allows the group members to view the device's configuration.
        - `test`: Allows for testing commands.
        - `write`: Allows modifications to the configuration.
        - `interface`: Specifically allows configuration of interfaces
        - **Note**: Each comma-separated element is an individual permission
        - **Note**: You can find all of the permissions by using command `/user group print detail`

**CLI Command and Output Example (After):**

```mikrotik
/user group print
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flags  Name         Policy
       vlan94-users read,test,write,interface
```

**Effect:** We have created a new user group called `vlan94-users` with the `read,test,write,interface` permissions.

### Step 3: Create New User and Assign Group

We'll create a new user named `vlan94_user` and assign it to the `vlan94-users` group. We'll set a password of `TestPassword123`

**CLI Command:**

```mikrotik
/user add name=vlan94_user group=vlan94-users password=TestPassword123
```

**Explanation:**

- `/user add`: This command creates a new user.
    - `name=vlan94_user`: Specifies the username.
    - `group=vlan94-users`:  Assigns the user to the `vlan94-users` group.
    - `password=TestPassword123`: Sets a password for the user.

**CLI Command and Output Example (After):**

```mikrotik
/user print
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flags  Name        Group        Last Access
       admin       full         never
       vlan94_user vlan94-users never
```

**Effect:** We have created a user called `vlan94_user` which is a member of the `vlan94-users` group.

### Step 4: Testing the User

Now, attempt to login via SSH or Winbox using the new user. Verify the user only has limited access. For example, trying to view firewall rules as `vlan94_user` should fail.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/user group add name=vlan94-users policy=read,test,write,interface
/user add name=vlan94_user group=vlan94-users password=TestPassword123
```

**Parameter Explanations:**

| Command     | Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/user group add` | `name`       | Specifies the name of the new user group                                                                                                    |
|             | `policy`     | Specifies a comma-separated list of permissions for the group.  (e.g., `read,write,test,interface,web`, etc.). Full list found in help.         |
| `/user add`   | `name`        | Specifies the username                                                                                                                         |
|             | `group`        | Specifies the group the user belongs to                                                                                                       |
|             | `password`   | Specifies the password of the user.                                                                                                           |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

1.  **Incorrect Policy:**
    -   **Problem:** Users are granted too much or too little access.
    -   **Solution:** Carefully review each policy permission. You can view the full list of user policies with command `/user group print detail`
    - **Solution**: Remove or modify permissions of specific groups using command `/user group set <groupName> policy=<comma separated policy list>`.
2.  **Forgotten Password:**
    -   **Problem:** You forget the new user's password.
    -   **Solution:** Use the `/user set <userName> password=<newPassword>` command to reset the password as admin user.
3.  **Locked Out:**
    -   **Problem:** Incorrect password attempts can temporarily lock out users when using security features such as IP access lists or other access restriction policies
    -   **Solution:** Wait out the temporary lock, or reset the router if you have lost admin access.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Login with New User:** Attempt to log in via SSH, Winbox, or the Web interface with the newly created user (`vlan94_user`) and password (`TestPassword123`).
2.  **Verify Access:** Once logged in as `vlan94_user`, attempt to view parts of the configuration that should be off limits. For example, try to print firewall rules with the command `/ip firewall filter print`. Access should be denied, as the `vlan94-users` group doesn't have access to that functionality. You *should* be able to print the interfaces with the command `/interface print`.
3.  **Verify Group Members:**  As admin user, use the command `/user print` and `/user group print` to ensure the new user and group are correctly configured.
4.  **Logout:** Ensure you log out of the session as the newly created user.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **IP Access Control:** Restrict user access based on source IP address. This is configurable under `/user access`. This is a key security feature. For example, `/user access add address=192.168.88.0/24` will allow users coming from that subnet to attempt login.
*   **RADIUS/TACACS+ Authentication:** For larger deployments, consider centralizing user authentication with RADIUS or TACACS+.
*  **Read-Only Users:** If you need to provide read-only access, create another user group with the `read` policy only.
*   **API Access:** Limit API access via user groups with specific permissions. This is important for securing API endpoints.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

Since user and user group configuration is commonly done via CLI or Winbox, REST API examples are less common for this specific topic. However, here is a theoretical example for completeness. These are tested on RouterOS 7.13, some changes may apply for 6.48.

**Important:** This API is not available in RouterOS 6.48. These commands would need to be done via CLI or Winbox. These commands would need to be issued via RouterOS's own REST API endpoint via an external system.

**Example: Creating a New User Group**

*   **Endpoint:** `https://<router-ip>/rest/user/group`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request JSON Payload:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "api-group",
      "policy": "read,test,write,interface"
    }
    ```

*   **Expected Response (201 Created):**

    ```json
    {
     "message": "added",
     "id": "*1"
    }
    ```
*   **Example: Creating a New User**
*   **Endpoint:** `https://<router-ip>/rest/user`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
    "group": "api-group",
    "name": "api-user",
    "password": "Password123"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (201 Created):**
    ```json
        {
         "message": "added",
         "id": "*2"
        }
    ```

**Error Handling:**

*   If the user group already exists or a parameter is invalid (e.g., missing required parameter, incorrect format), the API will return an error, usually HTTP 400 (Bad Request). Review the response for specific errors.

## Security Best Practices

1.  **Strong Passwords:** Always use strong, unique passwords for all users.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to user groups.
3.  **Regular Audits:** Review user accounts and their permissions periodically.
4.  **Disable Default User:** If not required, consider changing the default username and password of the 'admin' user or disabling the user entirely.  The admin user should not have internet facing access, use a specific internal IP range for remote access if remote login is required.
5.  **IP Access Lists:** Restrict access to the router management interface using `/user access` based on IP ranges.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Granular Permissions:** While the `read,write,test,interface` policy is sufficient for this example, consider creating more granular policies for different types of users in larger setups. Use the `/user group print detail` command to view all available policies.
*   **Logging:** Implement logging for user logins and configuration changes to monitor and audit user actions. The RouterOS system logs should be used for this purpose.
*   **Documentation:** This documentation is comprehensive, but in real-world scenarios, more detailed documentation will be necessary.
*   **Automation:** For larger deployments, consider automating user and group provisioning using scripting.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

MikroTik's user management provides a flexible way to control access to the router. It allows you to:

*   **Create users with specific permissions:** This is crucial for maintaining security.
*   **Organize users into groups:** Simplifies management of user permissions.
*   **Centralize management:** All user settings are managed on the router.

User management is critical for:

*   **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access and reduces potential breaches.
*   **Administration:** Allows different administrators to perform specific tasks.
*   **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements by controlling access.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Granular vs. Simple:** Creating many small, finely grained user groups versus having a few large groups depends on the size and needs of your organization. Smaller groups offer better security but can be harder to manage.
*   **Local vs. Remote Authentication:** Local user management is simpler, while RADIUS/TACACS+ provides centralized access control for large networks.
*   **Limited Access vs. Full Access:** Restricting access to users should be the default. This is achieved using the `policy` parameter during user group creation. Limiting the access to the `/interface` policy for example, restricts the user to only interface configurations.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is specifically targeting RouterOS 6.48, but it should be almost identical in RouterOS 7.x.  Syntax and output formats may vary slightly between versions, but the core commands and concepts remain consistent.  The example REST API calls in the REST API section are only applicable to 7.x. Use the help command `?` or command autocomplete by pressing tab to see the supported commands and available options in each specific version of RouterOS.
