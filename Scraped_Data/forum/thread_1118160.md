Anyone using this version got mDNS working? If YES please tell me how ...I have CCR1009 with 5 vlans that's connected to my CRS326 switch where all my vlans reside either through ethernet or WiFiI want my printer that is AirPrint capable and sitting in vlan100 to be accessed by any apple device siting in vlan20This should be doable with mDNS but in my case the apple devices using vlan20 cannot communicate with the printer.According tonormisconfiguring mDNS is very simpleon my CCR1009 via terminal I issue:/ip/dns set mdns-repeat-ifaces=vlan100,vlan20is there something else thats needs to be configured using mDNS? because this does not work ... my apple devices cannot see the AirPrint capable printer

I've done a couple test and seems to work.But since mDNS just provides an IP address, one way it can go wrong is if the firewall blocks the resulting connection.On Mac (and some Linux and Windows with Bonjour installed), you can use:Code:Select alldns-sd-B _ipp._tcpto see any mDNS records for printers (IPP), which help confirm mDNS is arriving.

Thanks Amm0 ... I have not had any luck so farMy understanding is that mDNS is crucial for facilitating device discovery and communication within local networks without the need for a dedicated DNS server ... but Tik have not explained how that is implemented under RoS ... why introduce a new feature without some form of direction that is not puzzling .... rhetorically stated ...

AFAIK, it looks like RouterOS just copies the mDNS UDP packets between the selected interface.It's roughly same approach asviewtopic.php?t=204025&hilit=mdns.  Just implemented at a low-level.Basically RouterOS will look for mDNS if configured in /ip/dns, then  re-broadcast any mDNS the router gets on ANY of the mDNS interface to ALL of the configuration mDNS interfaces.So it's not some flexible mDNS "router", at this point, it just copies/mirror/repeats everythingbi-directionally.   The reason why this get more complex is if you want to define "one-way" repeating (i.e. mDNS flows uni-directionally).  Right now, basically, you can create ONE mDNS discovery zone, that "shares" everything between the interfaces configured in /ip/dns.  Perhaps more is planned, but I think that's what it does in beta3.

In fairness, I did one test of this... between a remote EoIP to my folk house.  If enable this 7.16 mDNS repeat in /ip/dns, I can see and control a Roku TV at least.  So we'll have to wait for Mikrotik to say more on what it should do...  All I can see is what a 15 minute tested showed.The remote EoIP and local network are both just in "LAN" interface-list, so there are no VLAN restrictions.  If you restrict VLANs... you have to allow both mDNS for input, and whatever protocol used by the device in forward.  That part isn't changed by repeating mDNS, the firewall still has to allow whatever traffic, even multicast.While Apple AirPrintshould work find being "repeated".   I'm not sure AirPlayworks if repeated due to DRM concerns - I dunno for sure (since a HomePod already deal with the apple things).  So I didn't test AirPlay, but that not working, would not be a surprise.  i.e. Apple AirPlay may need a src-nat NAT rule between VLANs (for AirPlay) since the source IP is unicast & I believe it enforces that AirPlay MUST be on same LAN.  So repeating the mDNS doesn't help when trying to play music/movie – maybe this has changed.  But testing AirPlay with this feature would not be a good "first test".

OT: @Amm0, have you connected two remote locations using EoIP with interface added to the Bridge (and eventually VLAN ID), or assigning an Address to EoIP and adding routing rule?MTU? Mangle rules?If you prefer I can be more specific with the question posting inviewtopic.php?t=206322

Correct, in my test case.  There RB1100AHx4 that hangs on my LAN that I use for mainly for testing beta/devices from work.  I have one EoIP link on that RB1100 that is a /interface/bridge/port on BOTH sides - it bridges my folk's remote LAN bridge (from a cAPac that acts as both the AP and router, with an EoIP tunnel (to RB1100)).  On the RB1100, there is a /ip/dhcp-client that pull my folk's LAN IPs on to the RB1100, and one additional port is tagged to same VLAN as EoIP.It seems to allow you set mDNS repeat on the EoIP interface, but unless both sides had that bridged with an /interface/vlan... I'm not sure there be a use case for repeating EoIP directly.  Even though there is EoIP involved, it's bridged to a LAN/VLAN on both sides - so it's LAN/VLAN that needs to be included in mDNS repeating.FWIW, While I have no need for printer between these "sites"...  I did verify my Mac on my local LAN see my Mom's printer, a 100 miles away, after enabling the *VLAN* associated with the EoIP tunnel in mDNS in /ip/dns... I can printer a web page on my Mom's inkjet.  Without repeating mDNS, the printer would not show up as an option in the Print Dialog.  After it I pick the HP in the dropdown.

With the new mDNS Proxy feature, I should just be able to add the 2 VLAN interfaces I want to broadcast between in IP/DNS and it should work correct? I had communication between my phone and Google Nests work with PIM for ages and for some reason it just stopped working so I want to give mDNS a try

A question...Do you think mDNS could work through a Wireguard tunnel?I've been trying since this morning and it doesn't work, I would like to understand if it is a limitation of the wireguard protocol.

---
### Post 11
Author: Unknown
Date: Unknown

Wireguard does not support multicast, and mDNS needs multicast... so not possible.  The mDNS support in 7.16 is just an "mDNS repeater", so the resulting "repeated" multicast can not be forwarded over WG.And why I've long argued that /ip/dns should act as mDNS/DNS-SD "Discovery Proxy" to deal with mDNS per RFC-8766.  Essentially that means that a regular DNS server can resolve multicast mDNS lookups, so RFC-8766 "discovery proxy" support for unicast DNS is what's needed for mDNS across subnet to work over WG, and compliant with Bonjour specs

I'll try with another VPN...Well... the  VPN does need to support multicast & that's the limiting factor to repeating mDNS.  I don't think L2TP work with new mDNS proxy.  So off top of my head, that be GRE+IPSec, EoIP+IPSec and ZeroTier - thatshouldwork with new mDNS repeater.

I was thinking about OpenVPN but now I see that the android/iOS app doesn't support TAP tunnel.So off top of my head, that be GRE+IPSec, EoIP+IPSec and ZeroTier - that should work with new mDNS repeater.OK, then I'll try with ZeroTier.Thanks again

I'll try this experiment myself later when I have some time.

I'll try this experiment myself later when I have some time.I guess theoretically that might work, but it gets confusing.  If you just keep both side EoIP bridged, use new /ip/dns/mdns-repeat on EoIP (+ local LAN/VLAN) on each router, and apply more simplified bridge filter to DROP anything NOT port 5353 from over the bridged EoIP+WG link.  And you could further tweak it to be a more generic  "multicast bridge over WireGuard" (using EoIP connecting over the WG IPs and bridged to desired LANs) by changing the filter rules to allow more/all multicast.

....I did find that mDNS to be very chatty but that is expectedI have just upgraded my MK to v.7.16, and I'd like to give this new mDNS feature a try.A Jellyfin container running on my linux server is on VLAN 20, ip 172.16.20.25My smart TV is on VLAN 30, ip 172.16.30.50. For the time being, the Smart TV can access media on the Jellyfin server only if I put bothon the same VLAN, but I don't want to do that for several reasons.So, what should I do to make this mDNS works?Thank you

In spite of the new mDNS feature, I haven't yet managed to make multicast work between two VLANs, that is, between the jellyfin server and a few clients on another VLAN.

Not to grave dig but one mistake I made as someone with very little experience with Mikrotik and bought my first device to learn and for 10gig. When I set up VLAN isolation and was blocking traffic between the VLAN's I didn't realize you could block established traffic. (I am coming from opnSense).User talks to IoT = PassIoT responds to User = BlockedChanging the VLAN block rule to only block the "new" connection state fixed my issue.

Normally, you should have this filter rule near the top of the forward chain:Code:Select all/ip firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related,untrackedand for IPv6:Code:Select all/ipv6 firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related,untrackedAnd in case fasttrack is needed:Code:Select all/ip firewall filteraddaction=fasttrack-connection chain=forward connection-state=established,related hw-offload=yesaddaction=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related,untrackedIt's like that in the standarddefconffirewall configuration or the example from the documentationhttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... theClients.Thoseacceptrules are placed above the rule that drops traffics. This also improves performance, because most of the normal traffics will be accepted by them and most packets will only need to be processed by a couple of rules.If you apply this, you won't need theconnection-state=newcondition on your drop rules anymore.
