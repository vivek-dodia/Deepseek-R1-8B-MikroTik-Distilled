Hi,I have the "MikroTik hAP ax lite LTE6" router (https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ax_lite_lte6).It has only 1 SIM slot. But I now need to have a solution that does an automaticfailover between 2 mobile providers (ie. 2 SIMs).And which also allows to use both SIMs at the same time, for examplerouting a specific traffic to a selected one (for example traffic to my streaming provider).While searching on the Web for such an4G/LTE router with Dual SIM,I was very surprized to see thatRouterOSgets used also in productsby other companies, like in this product model ("LT12") byCUDY:https://www.amazon.de/Cudy-Cellular-Gig ... B0BN2SY589It explicitly says "Operating System: RouterOS"  (in German "Betriebssystem: RouterOS").Is it the same RouterOS from MikroTik? Ie. is it a licensed use by them?(But on the CUDY website for the above "LT12" model athttps://www.cudy.com/products/lt12-1-0there is "RouterOS" not mentioned).Are there any other companies that use RouterOS in their products?Btw. I need a budget solution for my above described use-case with 2 SIMs.Can any of you recommend a product or solution and/or experience?Thx.

Btw, I have some more MikroTik devices,  for example the "hAP ac^2" router (https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ac2).It unfortunately does not have any SIM slots, but it has a USB port.If I attach to it a passive USB2 hub and to that hub then attach 2 LTE sticks with SIMs,would it then be possible to control these 2 LTE devices via RouterOS ?B/c somewhere I once had read that attaching a single LTE stick directly to the USB portwould make LTE possible in RouterOS, so the question is: what if I need to attach 2 LTE sticks to that single USB port ?Will it work?

In general, a USB stick with LTE should work via USB, and multiple via a hub should too.  But not all modems are compatible, and some may require issuing AT commands to switch modes.  Mikrotik has a list of modem here:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ularmodems.  Now just because something is not listed, it still may work & conversely also possible a listed modem may not work because of firmware/etc...If a modem works with Windows without drivers, it's likely to work on RouterOS.Two USB stick mean you have two modem, and the be better for redudency, than any "dual SIM" devices.  The way dual SIM work is only one SIM is active at a time.  Both the LtAP and LtAP mini support dual SIMs.  The "bigger" LtAP has both a dual SIM, and ALSO has 2nd slot for another modem inside.  Now using the LtAP with two modem take some DIY effort to instal modem and pigtails+antennas.

I'll try to find LTE sticks from that list.Two USB stick mean you have two modem, and the be better for redudency, than any "dual SIM" devices.The way dual SIM work is only one SIM is active at a time.But some companies do advertise also with "Load balancing" and "Bonding" with their Dual SIM device.Both the LtAP and LtAP mini support dual SIMs.  The "bigger" LtAP has both a dual SIM, and ALSO has 2nd slot for another modem inside.Now using the LtAP with two modem take some DIY effort to instal modem and pigtails+antennas.The LtAP ishttps://mikrotik.com/product/ltap_lte6_kit_2023I couldn't find the "LtAP mini" in the HW section. Do you have a link?I think I should stick to the "2 stick solution", as it seems more flexible, and much cheaper, I think.Some RouterOS programming is surely required, but that's OK.

This is unbelievable!3+5) And that in all their Dual SIM devicesonly 1 SIM can be active at the same time, not both.4) Says one can download their Quick Start Manual from their website.

While I mainly use Mikrotik router as LTE devices, I do have one site with an inherited Cudy LT something.  Amazon is wrong, it's not RouterOS.  It has decent web UI, but all the features are pretty fixed in how they work and there aren't a lot of customizations.  Small example, Cudy's do support ZeroTier but they don't let you customize anything about it which then makes it hard to more granular route selection.  Now, RouterOS offers way more flexibility, at the expense of complexity.My point about "dual SIM" does not tell the whole story, while the number of modems does... basically a product that offers "dual sim" does not mean it run both at same time, unless it had two modems.Personally, two LTE sticks to an RB5009/hAPax3/hAPac2/etc is an entirely reasonable approach.  Mikrotik's modems are pretty dated, and using LTE USB modems known to work in your country/carrier has some advantages over the generic modems Mikrotik uses since presumable they were tested by the local carrier.  And since RouterOS uses the Microsoft's MBIM modem protocol, most recent USB modem support.  As noted, RouterOS should look for all modems on the USB bus, even through a hub.  And RouterOS will act exactly the same in configuration as if it was a LTE-enabled RouterBoard, or just a router with USB modem attached.

To be fair on the posted image, also Huawei claims the same.It seems more likely that it is something lost in translation (or whatever) connected with amazon than originating from the manufacturers.

Just for the sake of completeness: during my (re)search I came up also over this professional/industrial device:Multi SIM 4G Router for Wireless M2M / IoThttps://www.e-lins.com/DE/H750-4G-Router.htmlI think it has 2 modems as it's capable to do all these things:

Yeah that one says TWO modems, and TWO SIM.  But none going to run RouterOS™.

Well, also the Teltonika RUTX12:https://teltonika-networks.com/products/routers/rutx12nice thingy, not exactly cheap.
