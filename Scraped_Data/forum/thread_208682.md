```
:do { :put [/system/health/get [find name=temperature] value] } on-error={:put "0"}
```

/system/health is kinda weird in how it works, since the values like temp are just plain list items... So the simple "get temperature" isn't going to work....You can just use a :do {} on-error={} to prevent errors (like temperature not being found):Code:Select allThe key part to understand is "/system/health get temperature" does not work, as all the health values are not indexed by name=.... so the specific entry must be found using [find] to get the .id for temperature item (or a [print as-value] anditerating over thelist-typearrayto locate the temperature item could also work, but that more code if it's just temp)

```
concatenate(
   if(ros_command(":do { :put [/system health get [find name=board-temperature1] value] } on-error={:put \"0\"}")>0,
     concatenate("RB Temp: ",round(ros_command(":do { :put [/system health get [find name=board-temperature1] value] } on-error={:put \"\"}")),"°C
"),
     ""
   ),
   if(ros_command(":do { :put [/system health get value-name=temperature] } on-error={:put \"0\"}")>0,
     concatenate("RB Temp: ",round(ros_command(":do { :put [/system health get value-name=temperature] } on-error={:put \"0\"}")),"°C
"), 
     ""
   )
)
```

```
:do { :put [/system/health/get [find name=temperature] value] } on-error={:put "0"}
```

very thanks!final result:Code:Select allI accept adjustements, for now, working perfectly!/system/health is kinda weird in how it works, since the values like temp are just plain list items...
