hiI am experiencing low bandwidth issue with my MikroTik NetBox5 AX pair, which is paired with MANT30 antennas. Despite using 80 MHz and 160 MHz channel widths, I am only achieving bandwidths of 400 to 450 Mbps on 80mhz and 400 Mbps on 160mhz, respectively, within a single room. This performance is significantly lower than expected for these configurations.Here are the details of my setup:Device Model: NetBox5 AX (Pair)Antenna Model: MANT30Channel Width: 80 MHz and 160 MHzObserved Bandwidth: 400-450 Mbps on 80 MHz, 400 Mbps on 160 MHzEnvironment: Single room with minimal physical obstructionsCould anyone please provide guidance on troubleshooting this issue? I have already verified the following:Firmware is up-to-date 7.15.3 stable.Channel settings are optimized and not overlapping with other devices.Devices and antennas are within a close range of each other with minimal interference.hear is config of ap# 2024-09-07 16:27:06 by RouterOS 7.15.3# software id =## model = L11UG-5HaxD#/interface bridgeadd admin-mac= auto-mac=no comment=defconf name=bridge/interface wifiset [ find default-name=wifi1 ] channel.band=5ghz-ax .skip-dfs-channels=all \.width=80mhz configuration.country=Russia .distance=0 .mode=ap .ssid=\"NETBOX 5AX" disabled=no security.authentication-types=wpa2-psk,wpa3-psk \.ft=yes .ft-over-ds=yes/interface listadd name=WANadd name=LAN/interface bridge portadd bridge=bridge comment=defconf interface=ether1add bridge=bridge comment=defconf interface=wifi1/interface list memberadd interface=ether1 list=WANadd interface=bridge list=LAN/ip addressadd address=10.11.10.1/24 interface=bridge network=10.11.10.0/ip dhcp-clientadd comment=defconf interface=bridge# DHCP client can not run on slave or passthrough interface!add interface=ether1/system clockset time-zone-name=Asia/Kolkata/system noteset show-at-login=noconfig of station# 1970-01-02 00:05:39 by RouterOS 7.15.3## model = L11UG-5HaxD# serial number =/interface bridgeadd admin-mac=D4:01:C3:BA:1D:A6 auto-mac=no comment=defconf name=bridge/interface wifiset [ find default-name=wifi1 ] channel.band=5ghz-ax .skip-dfs-channels=all \.width=20/40/80/160mhz configuration.country=Russia .mode=station-bridge \.ssid="NETBOX 5AX" disabled=no security.authentication-types=\wpa2-psk,wpa3-psk .ft=yes .ft-over-ds=yes/interface bridge portadd bridge=bridge comment=defconf interface=ether1add bridge=bridge comment=defconf interface=wifi1/ip dhcp-clientadd comment=defconf interface=bridge/system noteset show-at-login=no

Can you post your config export?Be sure you have your Country / Region set.   What 5Ghz Frequency are you using? I believe 5220 is MikroTik "sweet spot".  Lastly, since newer 7.13? release -- you have to manually configure distance value.

At what signal strength do the points see each other?Most likely the problem is in incorrect experimental conditions

finaly romoved netbox5 ax and installed mimosa C5c devices now stable signal -59 distance is 25km and bandwidth is around 500 mbps.
