**IP Settings**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

- Configure basic IP settings for an ISP network.
- Enable IPv6 and assign IPv6 addresses to interfaces.
- Establish multiple address pools for DHCP server.
- Configure default gateway and DNS servers.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

1. **Enable IPv6**

   - Navigate to IP > IPv6.
   - Click the "Add" button to create a new IPv6 address.
   - Enter the following parameters:
     - **Address:** The IPv6 address to assign.
     - **Interface:** The interface to assign the address to.

2. **Assign IPv6 Addresses to Interfaces**

   - Navigate to Interfaces.
   - Select the interface you want to assign the IPv6 address to.
   - Click the "IPv6" tab.
   - Click the "Add" button to create a new IPv6 address.
   - Enter the following parameters:
     - **Address:** The IPv6 address to assign.

3. **Configure Address Pools**

   - Navigate to IP > DHCP Server > Pools.
   - Click the "Add" button to create a new address pool.
   - Enter the following parameters:
     - **Name:** A name for the address pool.
     - **Range:** The range of IPv4 addresses to be assigned from the pool.
     - **Gateway:** The default gateway for the addresses in the pool.
     - **DNS Servers:** The DNS servers to be assigned to the addresses in the pool.

4. **Configure Default Gateway and DNS Servers**

   - Navigate to IP > Routes.
   - Click the "Add" button to create a new route.
   - Enter the following parameters:
     - **Gateway:** The IP address of the default gateway.
     - **Dst. Address:** 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) or ::/0 (IPv6)

   - Navigate to IP > DNS.
   - Click the "Add" button to add new DNS servers.
   - Enter the IP addresses of the DNS servers.

**Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/ip address add address=2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334 interface=ether1
/ip address add address=10.10.10.1/24 interface=ether2
/ip dhcp-server pool add name=pool1 range=10.10.10.10-10.10.10.254 gateway=10.10.10.1 dns-server=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
/ip route add gateway=192.168.1.1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0  
/ip dns set servers=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

- **IPv6 Address Assignment Failure:** Ensure that the interface is enabled for IPv6 support and that the IPv6 address is properly configured.
- **DHCP Address Pool Exhaustion:** Monitor the address pool usage and expand the range if necessary.
- **Default Gateway Misconfiguration:** Double-check the IP address of the default gateway to ensure it is reachable.
- **DNS Servers Not Responding:** Verify the DNS server addresses and ensure they are responding to queries.

**Verification and Testing Steps**

- Ping IPv6 address from a remote machine.
- Obtain an IP address from the DHCP server on a client machine.
- Trace routes through the default gateway.
- Verify DNS resolution using the configured DNS servers.

**Related Features and Considerations**

- **Firewall:** Configure firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Quality of Service (QoS):** Prioritize network traffic based on different criteria.
- **High Availability:** Implement load balancing or failover mechanisms for increased network resilience.
