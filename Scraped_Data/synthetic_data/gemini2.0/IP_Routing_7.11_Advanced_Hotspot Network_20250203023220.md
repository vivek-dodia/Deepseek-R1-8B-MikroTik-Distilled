Okay, let's dive deep into this comprehensive MikroTik RouterOS configuration and documentation.  This will cover routing on the specified subnet 190.129.32.0/24,  using `bridge-89` as our main interface, along with addressing all your other detailed requests.

# MikroTik RouterOS Configuration: IP Routing for Hotspot Network

This document outlines the advanced configuration of a MikroTik router for a hotspot network using the specified parameters:

* **Subnet:** 190.129.32.0/24
* **Interface:** `bridge-89`
* **RouterOS Version:** 7.11 (applicable to 6.48 & 7.x)
* **Configuration Level:** Advanced
* **Network Scale:** Hotspot Network (SOHO, SMB, potentially larger)

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario & MikroTik Requirements

This scenario involves a central MikroTik router acting as the gateway for a hotspot network. All devices connected to the `bridge-89` interface will receive IP addresses from the 190.129.32.0/24 subnet and have internet access.

**Specific Requirements:**

*   **IP Addressing:** The `bridge-89` interface will be assigned the IP address 190.129.32.1/24.
*   **DHCP Server:** A DHCP server will be configured to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients within the 190.129.32.0/24 subnet.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Masquerading will be enabled for internet access.
*   **Basic Firewall:** Basic firewall rules will be implemented to enhance security.
*   **Hotspot Configuration (Basic):**  Initial hotspot configuration, including user management, authentication and basic walled garden.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using both CLI and Winbox, with explanations.

### Step 1: Interface Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-89
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-89 interface=ether1 # Replace ether1 with your actual interface
```

**Winbox:**

1.  Navigate to `Bridge` -> `Bridges` tab and click the `+` button.
2.  Set `Name` to `bridge-89`, and click `OK`.
3.  Go to `Bridge` -> `Ports` tab and click the `+` button.
4.  Set `Bridge` to `bridge-89` and select the interface (e.g., `ether1`) and click `OK`.

**Explanation:**

*   We create a bridge interface named `bridge-89` to group multiple interfaces as a single broadcast domain. In this example, we add `ether1` to the bridge, replace `ether1` with your target interface.
*   All devices connected to the bridge will effectively be in the same subnet.

### Step 2: IP Address Assignment

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=190.129.32.1/24 interface=bridge-89
```

**Winbox:**

1.  Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
2.  Click the `+` button.
3.  Set `Address` to `190.129.32.1/24`, `Interface` to `bridge-89`, and click `OK`.

**Explanation:**
*   The router interface `bridge-89` now has an IP address (190.129.32.1/24), so it is reachable on the subnet. This is the gateway IP for the network.

### Step 3: DHCP Server Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=dhcp_pool_89 ranges=190.129.32.2-190.129.32.254
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=dhcp_pool_89 interface=bridge-89 name=dhcp_89
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=190.129.32.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=190.129.32.1
```

**Winbox:**

1.  Navigate to `IP` -> `Pool`. Add a new pool with name `dhcp_pool_89`, and address range `190.129.32.2-190.129.32.254`
2.  Navigate to `IP` -> `DHCP Server` and click the `+` button.
3.  Set `Name` to `dhcp_89`, `Interface` to `bridge-89`,  `Address Pool` to `dhcp_pool_89`.
4.  Go to the `Networks` tab, click `+` and add address `190.129.32.0/24`, `Gateway` `190.129.32.1`, and `DNS Server` `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`.

**Explanation:**

*   We create a DHCP address pool to manage the range of addresses available for assignment.
*   The DHCP server assigns IPs to devices connected to `bridge-89` from the pool.
*   The DHCP network settings define DNS and Gateway addresses.

### Step 4: NAT Configuration

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE
```
**Winbox:**
1. Navigate to IP -> Firewall -> NAT.
2. Click the + Button.
3. On General tab: `Chain` choose `srcnat`, `Out Interface` choose your external interface to reach internet (example `ether2`).
4. On Action tab: `Action` choose `masquerade`.

**Explanation:**

*   This rule performs source NAT (masquerading), making all devices behind the router appear to have the router's public IP address. Replace `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` with your router's actual interface connected to the internet (e.g. `ether2`).

### Step 5: Firewall (Basic)

**CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow Established/Related"
add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Allow ICMP"
add chain=input in-interface=YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE action=drop comment="Drop all other input from WAN"
add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Allow Established/Related Forward"
add chain=forward connection-state=invalid action=drop comment="Drop Invalid Connection"
add chain=forward src-address=190.129.32.0/24 action=accept comment="Allow forward from local subnet"
```

**Winbox:**
1. Navigate to IP -> Firewall -> Filter Rules.
2. Use the + to add new rules
3. Example of first rule: `Chain` `input`, `Connection State` `established,related`, `Action` `accept`, comment `Allow Established/Related`
4. Use the + to add a new rule: `Chain` `input`, `protocol` `icmp`, `Action` `accept`, `comment` `Allow ICMP`
5. Use the + to add a new rule: `Chain` `input`, `in-interface` `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE`, `Action` `drop`, `comment` `Drop all other input from WAN`
6. Use the + to add a new rule: `Chain` `forward`, `Connection State` `established,related`, `Action` `accept`, comment `Allow Established/Related Forward`
7. Use the + to add a new rule: `Chain` `forward`, `Connection State` `invalid`, `Action` `drop`, comment `Drop Invalid Connection`
8. Use the + to add a new rule: `Chain` `forward`, `src-address` `190.129.32.0/24`, `Action` `accept`, comment `Allow forward from local subnet`

**Explanation:**
* These firewall rules provide basic protection. Allow established and related connections, allow ICMP, drop all other incoming traffic from the internet interface, drop invalid connections and allow forward from the local subnet.
Replace `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` with your actual WAN interface (example: `ether2`).

### Step 6: Hotspot Configuration

**CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip hotspot profile
add name="hsprof1" dns-name=hotspot.example.com html-directory=hotspot login-by=http-chap
/ip hotspot user profile
add name="hsuserprof1" idle-timeout=10m keepalive-timeout=2m rate-limit="1M/1M"
/ip hotspot user
add name=user1 password=password1 profile=hsuserprof1
/ip hotspot
add name="hotspot1" interface=bridge-89 profile="hsprof1" address-pool=dhcp_pool_89
```

**Winbox:**
1. Navigate to IP -> Hotspot -> Profiles. Add new profile with `Name` `hsprof1`, `DNS Name` `hotspot.example.com`, `HTML Directory` `hotspot`, `Login By` `http-chap`
2. Navigate to IP -> Hotspot -> User Profiles. Add new profile with `Name` `hsuserprof1`, `Idle Timeout` `10m`, `Keepalive Timeout` `2m`, `Rate Limit` `1M/1M`
3. Navigate to IP -> Hotspot -> Users. Add new user with `Name` `user1`, `Password` `password1`, `Profile` `hsuserprof1`
4. Navigate to IP -> Hotspot. Add new Hotspot with `Name` `hotspot1`, `Interface` `bridge-89`, `Profile` `hsprof1`, `Address Pool` `dhcp_pool_89`

**Explanation:**

*   Here we create basic hotspot configuration, including user profiles, user accounts and basic setup on our bridge interface.

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

### Pitfalls:

1.  **Incorrect Interface:** Make sure `YOUR_WAN_INTERFACE` is replaced with your actual internet-facing interface. Failure to do so will result in no internet access.
2.  **Firewall Misconfiguration:** Overly restrictive firewall rules can block access to the router and internet access.
3.  **DHCP Conflicts:** Address pools must not overlap with other networks or devices.
4.  **DNS Settings:** Incorrect DNS servers will result in inability to resolve hostnames.
5.  **Hotspot issues:** Incorrect hotspot configuration could lead to authentication issues.

### Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:

*   **`ping`**:
    *   Test connectivity to the gateway `190.129.32.1`.
    *   Test external connectivity by pinging external IP address like `8.8.8.8`.
    *   `ping 190.129.32.1` - test gateway
    *   `ping 8.8.8.8` - test internet
*   **`traceroute`**:
    *   Trace the path of packets to external destinations.
    *   `traceroute 8.8.8.8`
*   **`torch`**:
    *   Monitor live traffic on the bridge interface.
    *   `/tool torch interface=bridge-89`
*   **`/ip dhcp-server lease print`:**
    *   Check DHCP leases to see which devices have received an IP address.
*   **`/log print`**:
    *   View system logs for error messages and troubleshooting information.

### Example Error Scenarios:

*   **No internet:** Check the NAT configuration, firewall rules, and your external interface is correct.

*   Bridging allows multiple physical interfaces to act as a single broadcast domain. Useful when connecting multiple switches in the same network. However, bridging doesn't perform inter-VLAN routing.
*   You can combine multiple interfaces with bonding for redundancy and load balancing.
*   Bridge filtering (using firewall on bridge interface) adds layer-2 filtering capabilities, offering options beyond layer 3.

**Routing:**
*   MikroTik supports various routing protocols, such as OSPF, BGP, RIP, and static routes.
*   Policy-based routing allows for granular control over traffic flows.
*   VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) enables multiple routing tables on the same router.

**Firewall:**
*   Connection tracking is crucial for stateful firewall functionality. It helps distinguish new, established, and related connections.
*   The firewall uses rules based on several conditions like IPs, ports, interface.
*   QoS is integrated, allowing for traffic shaping and bandwidth control.

**Less Common Features:**
*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** Allows multiple isolated routing instances on the same router for more complex networks.
*   **Policy Routing:** Enables routing decisions based on source/destination addresses or other traffic attributes for complex path selection.
*   **MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching):** Used in large networks for fast packet switching and creating virtual private circuits.

**Limitations:**
*   Performance of certain features may be limited by the router's hardware capabilities.
*   Complex configurations might require thorough testing and planning before deploying in a production environment.

## 8. In-depth Explanation of Core Concepts

**IP Addressing:**
*   **IPv4:** Uses 32-bit addresses for device identification. Represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g. 192.168.1.1). The subnet mask determines the network part and the host part.
*   **IPv6:** Uses 128-bit addresses, designed to address the limitations of IPv4, represented in hexadecimal format with colons (e.g., 2001:0db8::0042:1).
*   MikroTik supports both static and dynamic IP addressing via DHCP.

**IP Pools:**
*   A defined range of IP addresses that can be dynamically assigned by a DHCP server to connected devices. Ensures that clients do not use the same IP address.
*   You can set up several IP pools for different subnets or purposes.

**IP Routing:**
*   The process of moving IP packets between different networks. Done by routers, based on IP addresses and routing tables.
*   Static routing involves manual configuration of routes, while dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP) automate this.

**Bridging:**
*   Layer 2 technology combining network segments into a single broadcast domain. Devices within a bridge can communicate without routing.
*   Often used for connecting multiple LAN segments or in conjunction with virtual machines.
*   Bridge interface can also act as an interface with an IP address to provide gateway functionality for all its attached segments.

**Firewall and NAT:**
*   **Firewall:** Used to filter network traffic and block unauthorized access using rules and defined policies. Connection tracking is the key of stateful firewall, allowing to track the connection status.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Translates private IP addresses used in local networks into public IP addresses when communicating on the internet. Masquerading is the most used form of NAT on SOHO routers, so multiple hosts share the same public IP.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex, unique passwords for all user accounts, including the administrator account.
*   **Change Default Ports:** Change the default ports for services (Winbox, SSH) to reduce exposure to attacks.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement a robust firewall policy with allow-lists and explicit deny-rules.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable unnecessary services like Telnet or any other unsecure protocol to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS up-to-date with the latest versions and security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   **HTTPS Only:** Enable HTTPS for secure administration access instead of HTTP.
*   **RoMON:** Disable RoMON if not used, as this is designed for network management and could be a security risk.
*   **MAC Server**: Ensure your MAC Server is well configured for your particular needs, restricting the access.
*  **Certificates:** Use valid certificates to prevent man in the middle attacks.
*   **Limit Winbox Access:** Restrict Winbox access to specific IP addresses.
*   **Review User Permissions:** Review and limit user permissions to prevent unauthorized configuration changes.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor system logs for suspicious activities and potential breaches.
