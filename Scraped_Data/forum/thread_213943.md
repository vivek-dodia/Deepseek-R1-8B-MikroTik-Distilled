All is currently handled by the CPU, while you should have VLAN filtering handled by the switch chip.Something like this should work:Code:Select allPlease check the attached link for full explanation.Btw, above config is based on a v6 config. Might be some small differences.

All is currently handled by the CPU, while you should have VLAN filtering handled by the switch chip..Hi agin, based on your suggested config I actually just added .../interface ethernet switch portset 1 vlan-mode=secureset 2 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 3 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 4 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secureset 5 default-vlan-id=100 vlan-mode=secure/interface ethernet switch vlanadd independent-learning=no ports=ether1,ether2,ether3,ether4,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=100add independent-learning=no ports=ether1,ether2,ether5 switch=switch1 vlan-id=68... and this is pretty much all I need as it seem. This also give me full interface speed ... but I will continue to go through the referenced link  as well.Have a nice weekend.//Anders
