## Initial Question
We are on the latest long term 6.0. We are trying to ftp to a server to grab a file. We would like it to automatically load the file and run it.Can this still be done? I remember years ago doing something like this. If anyone knows how to do this with an example I would appreciate it.Thank you. ---

Seehttps://wiki.mikrotik.com/Manual:Config ... Management, sectionAutomatic Import. Script file must be named<something>.auto.rscand it will be executed after upload. ---
