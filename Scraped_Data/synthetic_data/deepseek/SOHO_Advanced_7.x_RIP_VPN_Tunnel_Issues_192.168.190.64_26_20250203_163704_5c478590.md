# Analysis Process
Okay, let's tackle this MikroTik RouterOS troubleshooting scenario for RIP with VPN Tunnel Issues. The user wants a detailed scenario based on the given parameters. I need to make sure I cover all the required sections: problem report, environment description, assessment steps, debugging with CLI commands, root cause, solution, verification, prevention, commands reference, and pitfalls.

First, the topic is RIP (Routing Information Protocol) on RouterOS 7.x in a SOHO network. The subnet is 192.168.69.160/27, which is a /27, so that's 32 addresses. The environment is a data center, which is a bit unusual for SOHO, but maybe it's a small data center setup. The main issue is VPN Tunnel problems affecting 189 users for 8 hours. Since it's SOHO, maybe the setup is simpler, but with a data center, perhaps there are multiple routers or connections.

Starting with the Initial Problem Report: Users can't access internal apps via VPN. Symptoms might include RIP routes not propagating, VPN tunnel down, high latency, maybe authentication issues. Let's say the VPN tunnel is up but traffic isn't routing correctly because RIP isn't advertising the routes properly.

For the Network Topology, using Mermaid. Let's outline the SOHO setup. There's the Main Router (R1) connected to a Data Center Switch, which connects to the VPN Concentrator. Then, R1 connects to the Internet. Remote Site Router (R2) connects over the internet via a VPN tunnel to R1. The subnets involved are 192.168.69.160/27 (DC) and 10.10.10.0/24 (remote). The VPN uses IPSec.

Initial Assessment Steps: Check interface statuses, RIP neighbors, routing tables, VPN status. Use commands like /interface print, /routing rip neighbor print, /ip route print, /ip ipsec active-peers print.

Detailed Debugging: Check RIP configuration. Maybe RIP isn't enabled on the correct interfaces. Verify with /routing rip interface print. Look for any authentication settings in RIP. Check if the VPN subnet is included in RIP networks. Use /routing rip network print. Maybe the remote subnet (10.10.10.0/24) isn't being advertised. Check the VPN tunnel status with /ip ipsec policy print. Maybe the policies are incorrect. Look at IPsec logs with /log print where topics=ipsec. Maybe there's a mismatch in settings. Check if routes are being exchanged via RIP. Use /routing rip route print. If routes are missing, that's the issue.

Key Findings: Suppose the RIP configuration on R1 is missing the network for the VPN interface (like the tunnel IP). So RIP isn't advertising the DC subnet over the VPN. Or maybe the VPN tunnel isn't allowing RIP multicast packets (UDP 520) through. Another possibility is that IPsec policies are not correctly set to encrypt RIP traffic, causing it to be blocked.

Solution: Add the VPN tunnel interface to RIP networks on both routers. Adjust IPsec policies to allow UDP 520. Verify configurations. Then reset RIP and IPsec to apply changes.

Verification: Check RIP neighbors again, confirm routes are in the table, test connectivity. Use ping and traceroute from remote to DC subnet.

Prevention: Ensure all relevant networks are included in RIP, monitor RIP adjacencies, configure IPsec correctly for routing protocols, use static routes as backup.

Commands Reference: List the important commands used in each step.

Pitfalls: Forgetting to include VPN interfaces in RIP, not allowing protocol traffic in firewall, misconfigured IPsec policies, not checking logs.

I need to make sure the CLI commands are accurate for RouterOS 7.x. For example, RIP configuration in 7.x might have different command structures. Also, check if RIP uses multicast by default and if IPsec is set to transport mode or tunnel mode. Maybe the MTU is an issue, but that's more for fragmentation. Alternatively, maybe the VPN is up but the RIP updates aren't passing through because the encryption domain doesn't include the RIP multicast address.

Wait, RIP uses multicast address 224.0.0.9. If the IPsec policies are only set for unicast traffic between the subnets, the multicast might not be encrypted, so the RIP packets are dropped or not forwarded. So the IPsec policy should include the tunnel interfaces' IPs and allow multicast. Alternatively, using GRE over IPsec could encapsulate the multicast traffic.

But the user specified VPN Tunnel Issues, so maybe the root cause is that RIP is configured on physical interfaces instead of the tunnel interfaces, so the routes aren't exchanged over the VPN. Therefore, adding the tunnel interfaces to RIP would fix it.

In the configuration, before the fix, the RIP networks might only include the LAN interface, not the tunnel. After, they include both LAN and tunnel interfaces.

Also, check if the firewall is blocking RIP traffic on the tunnel. Maybe a filter rule is dropping UDP 520.

So, putting it all together, the detailed steps would involve checking RIP configuration, verifying interfaces, checking IPsec policies and logs, adjusting the RIP networks, updating IPsec policies to allow RIP traffic, and testing.

# Troubleshooting Guide

# MikroTik RouterOS Troubleshooting Scenario: RIP VPN Tunnel Issues

## 1. Initial Problem Report and Symptoms
**Report**: 189 users in a SOHO data center cannot access remote resources via an IPSec VPN tunnel.  
**Symptoms**:
- VPN tunnel shows "established" but no traffic passes
- Missing RIP routes for `10.10.10.0/24` (remote site) in local routing table
- High CPU usage on routers during peak hours
- Intermittent `ping` success between VPN endpoints

## 2. Environment Description
**Network Topology**:
```mermaid
graph TD
  R1[Main Router (R1)<br>192.168.69.161/27] -->|ether1| DC_SW[Data Center Switch]
  DC_SW -->|ether2| VPN_Concentrator
  R1 -->|pppoe-out1| Internet
  R1 <-..->|IPSec Tunnel| R2[Remote Router (R2)<br>10.10.10.1/24]
```

---
## 3. Initial Assessment Steps
1. **Verify Interface Status**:
   ```bash
   /interface print
   ```
2. **Check RIP Neighbors**:
   ```bash
   /routing rip neighbor print
   ```
3. **Inspect Routing Table**:
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=rip
   ```
4. **VPN Status Check**:
   ```bash
   /ip ipsec active-peers print
   ```

---
## 4. Detailed Debugging Process
### Step 1: RIP Configuration Audit
```bash
/routing rip instance print
# Expected: Interfaces=ether1,tunnel1
# Actual:   Interfaces=ether1 (missing tunnel1)

/routing rip network print
# Expected: Networks=192.168.69.160/27,10.10.10.0/24
# Actual:   Networks=192.168.69.160/27
```

### Step 2: VPN Tunnel Analysis
```bash
/ip ipsec policy print
# Phase2 proposal mismatch: 
#   R1: aes-256-sha1-modp2048 
#   R2: aes-128-sha256-modp1024

/log print where topics=ipsec
# Sample Log:
# 08:15:23 ipsec,error no matching proposal found
```

### Step 3: Firewall Rules Check
```bash
/ip firewall filter print
# Rule 0: action=drop chain=input protocol=udp dst-port=520 (RIP)
```

---
## 5. Key Findings & Root Cause
**Root Cause**:  
1. RIP not configured on VPN tunnel interface (`tunnel1`)  
2. Phase2 proposal mismatch in IPSec configuration  
3. Firewall blocking RIP traffic (UDP/520)  

**Impact**:  
- RIP routes not exchanged over VPN tunnel  
- IPSec tunnel fails to renegotiate  
- 100% packet loss between subnets  

---
## 6. Solution Implementation
### Step 1: Update RIP Configuration
**Before**:
```bash
/routing rip network add network=192.168.69.160/27
```
**After**:
```bash
/routing rip network add network=192.168.69.160/27
/routing rip network add network=10.10.10.0/24
/routing rip interface add interface=tunnel1
```

### Step 2: Fix IPSec Policies
```bash
/ip ipsec proposal set [find name="default"] \
  encryption-algorithms=aes-256-cbc \
  hash-algorithms=sha1 \
  dh-group=modp2048
```

### Step 3: Adjust Firewall
```bash
/ip firewall filter move [find protocol=udp dst-port=520] 0
```

---
## 7. Verification Process
1. Confirm RIP routes:
   ```bash
   /ip route print where protocol=rip
   # 10.10.10.0/24 via 192.168.69.161
   ```
2. Test VPN throughput:
   ```bash
   /tool bandwidth-test 10.10.10.1 direction=both
   ```
3. Validate IPSec status:
   ```bash
   /ip ipsec active-peers print
   # status=established, packets=↑1.2M ↓1.1M
   ```

---
## 8. Prevention Measures
1. Implement configuration templates for RIP/IPSEC  
2. Enable automated backups:
   ```bash
   /system backup schedule add name="daily" interval=24h
   ```
3. Monitor with SNMP:
   ```bash
   /snmp community set addresses=192.168.69.160/27
   ```

---
## 9. Related Commands Reference
| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| RIP Debug | `/routing rip monitor 0` |
| IPSec SA | `/ip ipsec installed-sa print` |
| Route Flush | `/routing rip flush` |

---
## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ **Mixing RIP v1/v2**: Always use RIPv2 in modern networks  
```bash
/routing rip instance set version=2
```
❌ **Ignoring MTU**: Fragmented RIP packets cause drops  
```bash
/interface tunnel1 mtu=1400
```
❌ **Static vs RIP Priority**: Ensure RIP routes have better distance  
```bash
/ip route set distance=120 [find protocol=rip]
```
```
