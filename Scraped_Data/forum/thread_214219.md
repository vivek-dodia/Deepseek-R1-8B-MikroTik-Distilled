Hello,I recently updated to version 7.17 from 7.16.2 and encountered a major issue with bridges. Their MAC addresses keep changing continuously.I’ve stripped down the configuration as much as possible, and the problem persists even with just the following minimal setup (tested on CCR, HEX, HAP, etc.):Code:Select allHere’s a screenshot showing the issue:2025-01-26 17_49_51-Window.pngAfter rolling back to version 7.16.2, the problem disappears entirely.After discussing with someone on the forum, it seems we’re not supposed to create multiple bridges. I don’t understand—why allow the possibility to do so then?The default config creates a bridge and it has the admin-mac set correctly.You should normally not create any additional bridges!  The VLANs can (now) be added on the single bridge.Open a new topic with your specific requirements and/or look in the existing topics about bridge and VLAN!Indeed, I’ve seen that VLANs can be used directly within a single bridge. However, the issue is that some features only apply to bridges and not to VLANs, such as IGMP Snooping.I’d like to remind you that before version 7.17, there was no such issue.Thank you for your help.
