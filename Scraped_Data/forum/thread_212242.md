Hey there.This one has me stumped. Maybe someone has a bright idea:I have two cAP ax, and a hAP ax3). One cAP and the hAP have been set up using capsman from the central router. Both are running as expected since months.I've now tried to add the second cAP. Capsman sees it and lists it in the "Remote CAP" tab, but does not provision it. Firmware upgrade to 7.16.1 worked via capsman. Configuration of the new hAP is identical to the old one, except for the radio config. This is the config, the new cAP is missing the two capsman managed wifi interfaces:Adding the lines manually doesn't help.Disabling capsman on the router and re-enabling it yielded the following log:Any clue what's wrong here? Why isn't it properly provisioning?

Tried resetting the config to caps mode again. Same result. New cAP finds capsman and joins, but the radios are never provisioned.Somehow I cannot see the radios on the AP. Is there any way to verify that the hardware is there? Can I list the radio devices somewhere else than /interface/wifi/radio?

Are their provisioning rules which match the new radios?Can you share the wifi config of the CAPsMAN?/interface wifi export file=anynameyoulikeRemove any private info, post between code tags by using the </> button.

Found the reason for the missing radios: during a previous netinstall, I failed to add the wifi-qcom package. D'oh. No wifi package = no wifi support.Installed the package and the radios are there. However, they are not reported to capsman and still not provisioned.

Thanks for your reply @erlindenManaged to solve it. After installing the missing wifi-package, I had to reset the config again, then enable caps mode as before. Everything worked as expected at that point.How can I mark this as solved?

How can I mark this as solved?I took care of that for youOn the post which contains the answer, you can hit the button right next of the Quote icon. That sets it as solved.
