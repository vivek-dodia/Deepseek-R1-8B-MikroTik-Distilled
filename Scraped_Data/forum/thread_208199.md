Hi everyone.I've recently changed my tp-link archer ax50 for hap ax3. Now I have some problems with 5GHz wireless. The firmware version is 7.15 Here's my configCode:Select all1 M BR default-name="wifi1" name="wifi-5ghz" l2mtu=1560 mac-address=D4:01:C3:9D:86:32 arp-timeout=auto radio-mac=D4:01:C3:9D:86:32 configuration=home-private-cfg

        channel=5ghz 
        channel.frequency=5180-5320,5660-5845 .band=5ghz-ax .width=20/40/80mhzThe problems are:1. MSI laptop ax-capable states that it connects using 802.11ac (was ax with archer).2. Random disconnects mostly under load. Windows shows full or 2/3 points signal and around 500Mbps transmit bandwidth.Here's log with debug enabled:Code:Select all06-06 01:39:49 wireless,info 0C:7A:15:F5:D2:AF@wifi-5ghz disconnected, connection lost, signal strength -81

Both Samsung android phones doesn't seem to have this problem, however I didn't pushed any significant network load on them, like YT or something.Do I miss something?

Here's my configIt would be clearer if you posted the sanitized output of "/interface/wifi/export", not "print" because that includes sub-items like the configuration and security sections.One thing this can show more clearly is when you have redundant or conflicting items in the "configuration" and "interface" sections, for example. The "configuration" should abstract as much as possible that is the same between the 2.4 and 5GHz radios, leaving the "interface" element to override only the unique parts.A clean implementation of that will look something like this:Code:Select all/interface wifi configuration add country="United States" mode=ap name=homecfg security.authentication-types=wpa2-psk,wpa3-psk .ft=yes .ft-over-ds=yes .passphrase="nunyaBinness" ssid="Home WiFi"
/interface wifi set [ find default-name=wifi2 ] channel.band=2ghz-ax .width=20/40mhz configuration=homecfg
/interface wifi set [ find default-name=wifi1 ] channel.band=5ghz-ax .width=20/40/80mhz configuration=homecfgThe point is, there is only one "configuration" for both radios, and they differ only in the frequencies and such.MSI laptop ax-capable states that it connects using 802.11ac (was ax with archer).Then there is an incompatibility. It may be enough to explain everything else you're seeing. Your task is to find out what the laptop wants that the MT isn't providing. The fix may be a settings change away, or it may be a hard limit on one end or the other.Code:Select all06-06 01:40:00 wireless,info 0C:7A:15:F5:D2:AF@wifi-5ghz connected, signal strength 20

It is possible that all you're getting here is additional visibility into what's going on that your old router didn't tell you.A common reason for this type of behavior is bouncing between the 2.4 and 5GHz sides of the network.That said, I don't see a reconnection event immediately afterward on the other network, so…there's even no door between roomsWiFi doesn't use airborne transmission.The wall between the two rooms is likely more relevant to the router's operating conditions than the human-sized door frame and hallway between them.I've started my config without countryRouterOS has defaulted to "Latvia" for the last few releases, so unless that's where you live, you should always set the country.antenna gainUnless you're doing something advanced, you should leave this unset. Being the lowest legal value, "0" is likely wrong even if you do have good cause to be setting it.

I don't need this band for now, so there's no switching between, old router is powered off. I did exactly as you described - everything in config is separated from the physical interface (except for authentication types - they seem to be ignored from security config, leaving my network "open", and only setting them to the physical interface did the job. This seems like a new bug for me, bcz it worked in ROS6).And about provided logs - at first, I just did configuration and started using network. However, I noticed frequent disconnects on the laptop, lasting for like 5-20 seconds or so to reconnect automatically. That's why I'd opened logs, and this is the events that are logged when disconnect occurs. Also, when disconnect happens, laptop shows 1/3 SSID signal strength and tries to reconnect, and when reconnect happens it becomes 3/3 again. Laptop is literally used as desktop now, with same positioning for itself and old router/new ax3. With old router I played online games no problems or disconnects.Also have to notice that wireless quality itself is perfect until it disconnects, i.e. surfing is omega-fast and smooth, no lags for youtube or twitch (or both at once).Things that I've also read from this forum or reddit before posting:1. Possible antenna damage - I had my antennas attached before power on2. Possible ROS7.15 wireless bugs - signal strength sometimes shows above zero, can firmware version be the cause of the problems?This is the log of one of disconnect events, showing thisCode:Select all13:39:32 wireless,info 0C:7A:15:F5:D2:AF@wifi-5ghz disconnected, connection lost, signal strength -75

Wireless interfaces are bridged but should not be - they are, but doubt it affects wireless connectivity, since I did same config in ROS6.4. Tried to play with frequencies - leaving it blank sets channel to 5500, and SSID becomes invisible to Samsung S21

The antenna gain is incorrect, it should be 5 or 6 (in the manual it shows 5.5). Don't know what the default is, at least it is not 0.

Don't know what the default is, at least it is not 0.Can't set it to decimal value, gonna try with 5 and respond back with results.Any ideas on why laptop is not recognizing ax protocol tho? Because Samsung shows "6" on the wireless icon, not sure if it's using ax but I think it is, while laptop is always at .11ac no matter what configs I did before

Strange, as the MikroTik is supplying and the laptop is capable. Have you checked with an app like Wifi Analyzer?I also notice you use "disable-pmkid=yes", can you start again from the basic configuration (disable current /interface wifi configuration and add a new one)?

authentication types - they seem to be ignored from security config, leaving my network "open"This is the kind of thing I meant in my first reply: you're setting it from two different places, creating a conflict:Code:Select all/interface wifi configuration
add antenna-gain=0 country="United States" disabled=no name=home-private-cfg security.authentication-types="" .ft=no .ft-over-ds=no ssid=MikroTik-Home
/interface wifi security
add authentication-types=wpa2-psk disable-pmkid=yes disabled=no name=home-privateNote that "security.authentication" is set as blank on the first line and to "wpa2-psk" on the second.This is thesamesetting!Which one takes precedence? I dunno, but there's no reason to press your luck. If you're going to have an "/interface wifi security" entry, you shouldn't be including "security.ANYTHING" in your "/interface/wifi/configuration" entry. You can do it either way, however it makes sense to you, but don't try to do it from both directions.(There's a third potential method, doing it from the top "/interface/wifi" level, too.)

Only apply configuration.And in configuration I only apply earlier made channels, security, ...But obviously when doing something QnD for testing, it can happen I set it all directly on interface

WiFi Analyzer tells this:Channel 136 5680 GHz (I've added some channels after another connection drop)Channel width 20 MHzProtocol 802.11ax (metro UI still shows 802.11ac, was also ax with tp-link) Dunno what to trust there now, reverting to old router shows ax proto in metro UI againAfter setting antenna gain to 5, I had another disconnect with laptop. Tried to forget the SSID and reconnect, gonna see what happens.On auth-types - since I did configuration with Winbox, the problem was that in /wifi/configuration I left auth types open, which produced the auth-types="" config and left the network open. Closing the auth types tab fixed this, so now it's set directly in security profile and working. A bit inconvenient but can move on with this. So the only thing that worry me now is constant disconnects.The config is now only different from stock with disabled pmkid and static 5ghz channels (auto sets channel 5500 which is invisible to my phones). Can try re-enable pmkid, or should I anyway create a new config?Can I also somehow see in winbox or terminal which 802.11 protocol clients are using?

---
### Post 12

Winbox (and terminal) will show with what rates devices are connected. That will indicate the protocol used (866 for ac, 1200 for ax).Adding a new config is not much of work (you can disable current if you want). Then you can be sure all settings are correct. But setting it to default manually will give the same result.

An optimistic update on the topic: I decided to rollback from 7.15 to factory firmware which is 7.14.1 and it seems to be no disconnects for some hours already. The bandwidth is still bad so there is a place for tweaks still. But at least it's stable now.

I also had many disconnects after upgrading my ax2 from 7.14.3 to 7.15.0For example, the music stream from the Google home-speakers was full of interruptions.After downgrading to 7.14.3 the disconnects are gone.

### Post 17
Author: Unknown

After contacting MikroTik support, they told me there's a bunch of feedback about 7.15 fw having disconnects, but they also told me there's some kind of problems reproducing this bug in their lab. So current solution for home devices is to revert back to latest 7.14.x, since in 7.15 there's qcom-driver update, and 7.15.1 doesn't fix that either. I also don't see anything related in beta branch, so it seems that this bug will stay for a while. It would be a good move from MT to make a separate branch with latest firmware and old stable driver until the problem is resolved.

### Post 18

I have the same problem. With support, I have already reset the router to factory settings 4 times and tried to select the configuration, but all to no avail. The only option is to roll back to 7.14.3.

After many weeks of testing with different wireless devices and reading (+ testing) all the 7.15.X changelog, v7.14.3 was promoted as very stable for me, despite some "nice to have" features and no relevant fixes (for my use case) of latest release, I suggest to skip.v7.16beta seems nice to try. Good luck!

I'm also having wifi issues on my mikrotik ax3. Unfortunately 7.15.2 doesn't solve this problem... I'm still waiting for a solution from Mikrotik developers.Before the update to 7.15, everything worked fine and there were no such problems. I have already tried different settings, they do not solve the problem in any way.I would also like to point out that the programs (winbox, webfig, mobile application for iOS) for configuration have a different interface for the "Reselect Interval" parameter, which also complicates the configuration of the router and can even create random errors in the configuration.Знімок екрана 2024-07-15 о 23.47.33.pngЗнімок екрана 2024-07-16 о 08.01.25.pngfile_324.jpg2024-07-16 08.13.31.jpg

No, I didn't try. I have devices that do not support wpa3 and there are devices that support it, I want those devices that support wpa3 to work through wpa3, and those that do not also have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi. That's why I have wpa2 and 3 enabled. Control protection cannot be turned off if wpa 2 and 3 are used.

How I can enable logging for a device?Although "Can you do xxxx?" is frequently used as a polite form of "Do xxxx!", the same wording may surprisingly mean an actual questionSome devices support logging and some don't, and since the MAC address of your device in question is private, it is not possible to find out the vendor, so it is not possible for anyone but you to know whether it is a computer, a mobile phone, or an IoT device, and hence whether logging is supported.Other than that, is only that single MAC address affected in your case?

Can you enable logging on your device 9D:08? maybe you see a reason there why it disconnects.How I can enable logging for a device?Depends on the device. If it is a PC or alike it may be easier to access log files than on an iphone (still possible IIRC). But to avoid confusion: I mean logging on the affected device itself. You see a regular disconnect in your AP logs. But you don't know why the client disconnected. That information is not available - except on the client itself.

I am currently at 7.15.2, so I have yet to do more testing with newer ROS versions.This was one of suggestions of MikroTik support guy. I can tell that this didn't solve disconnect problem neither on 7.15 nor on 7.15.1 on hap ax3 device (haven't tried 7.15.2 yet, but since there are no changes to wifi-qcom driver, I don't see a reason to give it a shot). I did try a bunch of configurations starting from the one after reset button, ending with a bunch of tweaks and sending around 10-15 supout files - no luck. It now became inconvenient for me to reboot the router here and there to upgrade to 7.15 and rollback again to working firmware after another tweak didn't do the trick, so I gave up on this and now use 7.14.1 until some information on disconnects show up. The only consistent thing I've noticed is that the more load on the network was done, the more chances to disconnect occur. So the connection could be "stable" for hours if I just leave device working, and could drop each 15 minutes while e.g. watching YouTube.

Same issues here on 7.15->7.15.3. Downgrade to 7.14.3 fixes the issue.It's maybe also worth noting that I've noticed some specific patterns. Namely, streaming video seems to be a big one: whenever I start a video call on Teams, or watch a movie on Plex on my Google Chromecast, the issue presents itself much more frequently.The worst case I have observed is the Chromecast being barely able to stream just a few seconds of video in between reconnects.It would be nice to have an official acknowledgement from MikroTik, documenting the temporary workaround of downgrading to 7.14.3 and the next steps the company is taking to fix this. (Maybe I have missed it -- in that case, could I kindly be pointed to it?)

TL:DR; 7.16rc4 fixes all wifi related issues.I recently was trying to stream a remux to LG C2 via Plex and found out i was also running into the same problem. The Plex log was showing as device(WebOS tv) was constantly getting disconnected and reconnected which then continued the stream on tv. After upgrading to testing channel or beta 7.16rc4 it seems to have fixed the issues.

The Plex log was showing as device(WebOS tv) was constantly getting disconnected and reconnected which then continued the stream on tv. After upgrading to testing channel or beta 7.16rc4 it seems to have fixed the issues.I recently gave a shot for rc3 too. At first, it seemed to be that it fixes a problem, it was stable for like 2 days or so, so I decided to give a try for WPA2/3 also. And within an hour I got a bunch of problems with every single device on wireless network, related to SA Query timeouts and reauthenticating. Reverting WPA2/3 back to WPA2 only, however, brought wireless network to a more stable state, while Intel AX201 device returned to its "disconnect each 5 minutes" state. So, I decided to give up at this point and revert back to 7.14.3, reporting each stage of testing to my opened support ticket.Since they've pinged me with a bunch of questions in this ticket after a month of silence and me gave up at this point, I think they're doing a great job to investigate this issue, so I really hope for a real fix in 7.17beta (or at least, a temporary revert to a wifi driver).

Would be beneficial if all people with problems share their config (at least the /interface/wifi part) to validate settings.Additional tip: when going up and down in versions you might run into some strange problems. Actually, I did...hence some steps that might be of use.I would advise (in case you want to give it another try) to:Create a config (using export)Reset the device, no default settingsRestore the config (using import)Be aware that some settings aren't part of the export (i.e. users).My ax's and ac's are all working perfectly fine with 7.16 rc4At least, send supout.rif file to support.

Classic Microsoft Forum topic.Even if not related to wifi-qcom:On wifi-qcom-ac my Linux Notebook with AX200 very often refused to connect to 2.4ghz when channel was 40mhz or was not even able to connect. Can't remember exactly. It basically connected to 5ghz most of the time and I did not notice this issue for a long time. I may changed device orientation or something and the signal dropped a little, and notebook tried to roam to 2.4. But it resulted in no wifi connection, because of iwlwifi flooding the log with DEAUTH CLIENT LEAVING messages (don't remember exact wording). After switching to 20mhz channel on 2.4ghz the notebook now can connect to 2.4ghz as well. Really astonishing. But maybe some Bluetooth interference or something.

TLDR; The fix was to limit myself to only channels up to 124.I got a hap ax3 and ax2 and have literally 0 issues with AX ClientsI'm currently running 7.17beta2, but always been running the latest version since December 2023.Some of the issues here sound similar to mine when started deploying Intel AX210 and BE200 Cards.Anything above 5ghz Channel 124 they only wanted to connect to with 20mhz channel width. (the issues sometimes were that it only connected at 802.11n speeds and sometimes it wouldnt connect at all)Keeping in mind, I'm from Germany.And that i also had this issue with AC only APs from competitors.If anyone is interested in my findings with AX210 and BE200 cards regarding this issue, it's mostly on the Intel Forum:https://community.intel.com/t5/Wireless ... -p/1550533I don't have any AX210s anymore but I've attached a screenshot of my working FT, WPA3, AX, 80Mhz Setup:Untitled.pngFor reference, I tried these network cards and they all work flawlessly:Any Channel:Realtek RTL8852AEMediatek MT7922 (aka AMD RZ6XX)Below Channel 124:Intel AX210Intel BE200 (Windows + Linux)Qualcomm WCN685x (not sure which exact version it is)

dtim-period is "1" by default. Some have dedicated SSID for IoT devices - which are mostly battery powered. In such a case a DTIM period of 2 may improve batter life. Maybe it even helps with disconnects - but can't test as I do not have "flapping clients".

It happens with any kind of configuration, whether it's defconf or not, and support guy told me they replicated the problem with Intel AX in their lab. I haven't noticed any issues with 7.14.3. But any 7.15 onwards the disconnects are just waaaay to often. All stuff that we tried with support worked anyway in 7.14 and did not in 7.15+ and yes I do upgrade routerboard etc etc.I'm not sure if the problem is the same with other devices, since laptop with Intel AX is my main wireless device and all focus was to fix this. Other devices are rare to no disconnects, or I didn't notice them. It's even worse with WPA3 enabled.If you don't have a problem, doesn't mean no one also have it nor it means they are just retards.

…support guy told me they replicated the problem with Intel AX in their labI was speaking of Apple devices, which as far as I know, do not include the affected Intel AX chipsets. Regardless, I am not attempting to gainsay the MT engineers on this one; if they say the chipset has a bug that affects RouterOS compatibility, then I believe them.What I object to is this "everything is terrible" attitude I'm seeing while it's been working here, steadily, since February. There's a mismatch somewhere, and I'd like to try and resolve it, not fall into an endless moan-fest.If you don't have a problem, doesn't mean no one also have it nor it means they are just retards.I did not use that derogatory term, and as a moderator here, I caution you against using it again on this forum.Rather than name-call the others, I prefer to contribute positively, as with this article I've just written, presenting a working configuration for at least one person, me. How much broader does that go? I don't know, but it's objectively the case that everything isn't terrible for everyone.

How much broader does that go? I don't know, but it's objectively the case that everything isn't terrible for everyone.I didn't name-call others, I rather meant the opposite - pretty sure people do best effort to fix this, not just throw "everything is bad" messages. Same for me.I appreciate your effort and took time to inspect your config. This is actually the same as I get right after /sys/reset. The only moment is that device auto-select 5GHz channel 5500 which doesn't work for half of my devices, so I have to specify channels manually. And yes, one step with support was: "reset your device to just wifi+default gateway and check if you have problems" which didn't succeed.I've bought my device around week or two before 7.15 release, so all stuff was good until update. And as I said, every time support suggested me a config change, I did update to 7.15+, checked if it works or not and downgrade back (because of unusable device) leaving changed config. And whatever changes we did worked well in 7.14. And yes I update adapter drivers directly from Intel site, so they're latest. After all my attempts I gave up as one of latest firmwares introduced another bug for me which I've also reported to them, so it wasn't comfortable for me to upgrade back and forth as ax3 device is my only home router. Supports told me they'll notify on changes, so I'm confident I did what I could, and not just moan.

@tangentThe origin is (probably) a (I believe now lost forever) twitter post, cited here (which explains some of the reasons to increase DTIM interval for Apple devices):https://www.sniffwifi.com/2016/05/go-to ... sleep.htmlThe analysis seems to make sense, and this "set DTIM to 3" advice can be found in a lot of places, the DTIM 4 is new (at least to me).

Ax3 is a single stand-alone device, so there's nowhere to roam. Support told me that those options make no sense in my setup (but are enabled by default).

Hey all, I had the same issues with disconnects on my hap ax2 and ax3 (capsman with FT), and just wanted to share that enabling tkip cipher helped. I know, weird, but it's working for me. I tested a lot of methods, 20mhz channel width, management protection, ft disabled etc. But only enabling tkip cipher in security works and my chromecast and macbook can connect to wifi now.

I've recently heard an opinion that connected USB3 device may affect wireless (friends who have ax3 had problems with usb and didn't have without). I had problems before I attached USB disk, and now there isn't much transfers (only error logs by now). Maybe it will be useful if anyone who has problems would also note in their messages if they use USB or not.

I have the very some problem, with many devices including my LG TV, NVIDIA Shield, my iPhone and iPad. I can’t watch movies from my Plex Media Server anymore because from time to time wifi keeps disconnecting on my ax3, I have to reconnect and restart the stream. Downgrading to 7.14.3 fixes everything, but it’s been months now and there’s no fix on newer firmware, what’s up with that, are we going to be stuck with 7.14.3?

This is slightly off topic, but can be interesting to read.Looking at this forum thread, I recognize a lot off the issues.But there is a difference in my experiences with AX.When the devices were released, I replaced all APs in my home. Then I noticed that the range is not as good as from the AC devices. To I doubled the number of APs. Each room has it's own AP. And the living room has two. One cap AX at 2.4 and 5, and a hap ax3 at 5 on a high channel with low power output (this is only for the dinner table).This setup works fine since the beginning, with all versions of routeros.Note that we only use Apple devices and just a few windows laptops from Lenovo for school and work. (I have a large family)I have 9 APs (5x cap ax, 1x wap ax, 3x hap ax3).The router is a CCR2004-16G-2S+.Current version is 7.16.1 on all devices.There are 7 ssids on different vlans.And on average 45 clients connected (including smart lights and sensors)Wpa3, wpa2, 802.11r (FT + FT over DS), 802.11k (steering rrm) and 801.11v (steering wnm) are all enabled (except on the ssid for smart lights). Used channels are 1, 5, 9, 13, 36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157.Vlan config, is tagged for all SSID's, but untagged for the capsman/management.It works fine, so it CAN work!But now comes the bad part...Keeping in mind that my AX system works, and that large AC setups were never a problem, I rolled out three large locations with AX.115x cap ax +- 400 clients44x cap ax +- 300 clients71x cap ax +- 500 clientsFrom the start I have many issues, like in this thread, disconnecting and reconnecting devices.Can you imagine what it's like to work on your laptop, sitting on the exact same spot for all day, having your wifi drop every 5 minutes?With the AP in sight?That is exactly what is happening!Many windows laptops just keep hanging on the worst AP they can find.Keep connecting and disconnecting from the wifi.While stationary!!!Old phones too, they just don't work.The range of the cap ax is less than the cap ac, maybe 6 meters at most.With new devices, things work better, more range, less disconnects.To make it at least usable, in the end I had to disable WPA3, FT, RRM and WNM. Also a good solution is to put an extra AP next to people with many complaints.I think at the MikroTik support desk, they only have the working AX, like I have at home.They can't imagine that their stuff doesn't work, but in some cases it doesn't.And it can't all be blamed on bad AP placement, wrong settings...Anyway, if you are out there having issues with your AX setup, keep in mind that it CAN work.And in the meantime, let's hope updates in the future will remove all issues like magic.

FWIW I had AX3 and now wAP AX on my desk.Since I have that wAP AX I use my laptop only via wifi. Zero disconnects. And using Azure Remote Desktop when working from home I would know immediately ... that environment is HIGHLY allergic to disconnects, even for a split second.(Using AX3 I also have used that setup for testing, also there, no problems noticed)I do see sporadic loggings indicating so but no disconnects on the client device itself.

I've also been suffering these disconnects for a while on my hAP ax3 but only on the 5G radio, I've been updating to latest ROS releases as they come out since I got it about a year ago and it seems like the issue has been getting progressively worse as the versions progressed. Since I remember noticing a little bit of issues at first, growing in severity until I finally got fed up and looked into it yesterday.Before yesterday I was on 7.16.3 and (without my chromecast connected) it would last for about a week tops and then start to get a bit unreliable. I also noticed that changing settings on the 5G interface would accelerate the degradation of its reliability. A reboot would fix it for a random amount of time. No different settings changed anything at all, I tried many variations of my own config, and also adopting configs that people have posted as "working configs", changing only the SSID, password and country. With my chromecast connected I noticed that if it was connected to 5G it would trigger the 5G radio to be rendered unusable (im talking repeating intervals of 15-45 seconds of it functioning followed by 30-120 seconds of being completely dysfunctional), even right after a reboot. With the chromecast connected to 2.4G, it was fine in that regard. However it would buffer alot and have quality reductions since my 20+ neighbours in wireless range have butchered the 2.4G band with overlapping and 80MHz wide channels, causing low speeds on 2.4G. I'm not attributing that to ROS issues since even with all that interference and noise the 2.4G interface doesn't drop out completely like 5G does, its just slow as hell.Another interesting thing I observed is that while the chomecast was causing the 5G interface to have a fit and barely work, it would also cause the 2.4G interface to have less performance (but not completely drop out) than it normally does. I didn't do any in depth analysis on it, I just noticed that both my phone and laptop would load websites noticeably slower (since I was researching the issue) while the chromecast was connected to 5G than when it was not. I have no idea if this is simply due to a software bug maxing out the hAP's CPU causing the slow downs or something else going on in the airwaves.Since I downgraded to 7.14.3 its been working perfectly fine even with my normal pre-debugging config with WPA2+3 and protected management frames enabled. The chromecast connects quickly (to 5G) when i turn it on unlike before where it took a long time. And both wifi bands function perfectly fine even after hours of watching stuff on the chromecast. I tried stress testing it to see if I could get it to break, by changing settings a bunch of times while saturating the connection with iperf and while reconnecting devices frequently, and I couldn't get it to fail on this version YET. It seems rock stable, but ive only had it running for 24 hours so far. I'll report back if time brings issues.

So the value you saw might be older default which was kept on your device dince wifi-qcom(-ac) was first installed.

7.14.x is not known to have any security related issues. See for more info here:https://mikrotik.com/supportsecOn the other hand, there are vulnerabilities not mentioned in the "security blog" at all. Instead Mikrotik silently fixed them. e.g.https://www.enricobassetti.it/2023/11/c ... -rest-api/

Hi,With lot of AX devices, i've found (capsman mode) a way to have a fully working without any random disconnect.The way is simple, create a master hidden ssid with channel config and a long passkey and have all others ssid as slaves.Code:Select all## CHANNEL CFG
/interface wifi channel
add disabled=no name=master_channel width=20/40mhz-Ce
add disabled=no name=slave_channel width=20/40/80mhz

## MASTER SSID
/interface wifi configuration
add channel=master_channel country=France disabled=no hide-ssid=yes mode=ap \
    multicast-enhance=enabled name=master_config \
    security.authentication-types=wpa3-psk .passphrase=RRRRRRRRRRR \
    .wps=disable ssid=master

## SLAVE SSID
/interface wifi configuration
add channel=slave_channel country=France datapath=vlan1049_datapath disabled=\
    no hide-ssid=no mode=ap multicast-enhance=enabled name=vlan1049_config \
    security=vlan1049_auth ssid=ZZZZZZI have wireless cams and no disconnect and roaming is fine. At this time, still stable since 18 days. Before this main change, they lost signal many times.

Why upgrade at all?First of all, it is psychologically degrading to think of having an up-to-date hEX S without any kind of problem and a hAP ax³ that, instead, has to stay with a version from almost the beginning of the year. For what reason then? We still don't understand where the problem lies, evidently.Security reasons?One of the most important reasons, regardless of whether there are security bugs or not.Security reasons?I can think of a thousand and more reasons...want to know from @Marvitex.Exactly, the reasons are many and there is no need to list them.But anyway, for example, I've been waiting for the PPSK for a while (since everything around WiFi features is slow, on MikroTik) and now that it arrives I can't try it out.

I've been having these issues as well using my HAP ax2 running ROS > 7.14.3. Been through the hoops with MT support using minimum configuration and trying to identify what devices cause WIFI disconnects. What we have found is that my Google Nest Speakers (Audio and Mini) cause regular and temporary WIFI drop-out for most, if not all all connected WIFI devices. Removing the Google Nest Speakers (Audio and Mini) increases WIFI stability significantly.Trying to re-configure ROS based on Mikrotik Support and forum recommended settings has been a rabbit hole for me with zero improvement to stability.Instead of trying to change the ROS configuration. Try to identify what devices are causing the issue by temporality removing them. Like Android TV, Google Nests and other similar devices. It's tedious, but could be bring valuable information to MK support.Since my issue cannot be reproduced on ROS <= 7.14.3, my conclusion is that this is a Mikrotik issue.

Before that, my phone was the only device permanently connected on 5Ghz with occasional temporary connections of laptops. No issues observed. After connecting WiiM on 5GHz, the phone, perfectly working up till then for almost a year, started giving me SA query timeouts at least once a day randomly.And yes, most likely it is Mikrotik issue, since in 7.15 the Qualcomm Wifi driver was updated, so it is pretty clear what is behind all this mess. Just rollback of the driver should fix it, but Mikrotik does not wanna hear about it apparently. So we are stuck with broken Wifi.

Since I see you have FT enabled.I have 2 and 5Ghz separated on different SSIDs, and connect devices directly where I want them to, and I have FT disabled, but otherwise basically the same setup (I even tried the connect priority setting with no impact), and with only 2 devices (my phone and WiiM Ultra), my phone gets SA query timeouts. Crazy to think you have no issues whatsoever with dozens of devices at the same time.

Tested 7.18beta2 today and the issue is still not completely fixed. Though it has been reduced a lot since the 7.16-7.17 builds I find. It's actually almost entirely usable now where as before I HAD to be on 7.14.3 to actually have a usable connection on the 5GHz interface. The two devices I have that trigger the problem do still cause the 5GHz interface to drop, but it's only when they first connect and its for a much shorter period of time.

Here is what I see when trying to connect my old Wyze Cam v1. Camera continuously sends 'Probe Request' but router is silent.I simplified configuration 2.4GHz to next:Code:Select all1 M B  default-name="wifi2" name="wifi2" l2mtu=1560 mac-address=xxxx arp-timeout=auto radio-mac=xxxx
        configuration.mode=ap .ssid="ssid1" .dtim-period=3 
        security.authentication-types=wpa2-psk .encryption=ccmp .passphrase="xxx"  
        channel.frequency=2437 .secondary-frequency=disabled .band=2ghz-g .width=20mhz 

 3   BI name="wifi4" l2mtu=1560 mac-address=xxxx arp-timeout=auto master-interface=wifi2 
        configuration.mode=ap .ssid="ssid2" .dtim-period=3 
        security.authentication-types=wpa2-psk .encryption=ccmp .passphrase="xxx"  
        channel.frequency=2437 .band=2ghz-gBut still silence form router. In logs it looks like that (2nd image), but I cannot see those connections and associations in Wireshark. May be some packets are filtered and I need to buy USB WiFi module that can be put into monitor mode to properly log WiFi communication.. I don't know.
