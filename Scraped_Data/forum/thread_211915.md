As was stated, we understand your request,  the problem is you dont understand how basic networking functions..............If you want all to be on the same network........... then do the following. Otherwise, suggesting on the  main router to create a separate subnet, best done through vlans.Code:Select allUse ether2, for what I call Offbridge access, direct access without any bridge affiliation, perhaps not as critical since not doing vlans but still recommended.Just connect your laptop to ether2 and change IPV4 settings to 192.168.55.2  and you will get access.If the capac is easily accessible, then easy to attach a temp cable.IF not easily accessible at least wire a second ethenet cable to a location where you can reach  it with your laptop.....

The Bonjour printer discovery also work which is great.It is still kind of slow and unstable so I guess I will have to dig a bit deeper but thanks for providing a very good start.

Please post your latest complete config and I will have a look.Thanks for asking. Here it is.It works but  is horribly slowNote that ether1 r(whose MAC is known to the main server) eceives a DHCP address from the main network. The DHCP server is on X.X.10.75 and does NAT as required for the lab laptops which are known and trusted on the wired network.Any advice would be more than welcome.Cheersp.Code:Select all

1- when configured as router with the usual subnet 192.168…. we loose some access to the rest of the network and most importantly all access to Bonjour printers so that in particular people with phones or tablets can’t print. Very frustratingI can't tell from the absence of the setting whether you tried my advice up-thread to enable the mDNS repeater and had it fail, or did not try at all. It's a single-line addition to your configuration:Code:Select allI was forced to guess on the proper interface names since your posted config is not for this #1 setup, but for #2 or #3, to use your list's numbering. Adjust to suit.Another thing not clear from your posted config is that when you have multiple DHCP servers on a single subnet, you need to arrange for them to not conflict. You can do that with a combination of firewall rules, use of RouterOS's DHCP snooping feature, and setting up non-overlapping address pools. As you have it now, your server and the other will fight.

It's a single-line addition to your configuration:Code:Select allIf I understand I should try this after a Quick Setup with the usual subnet for WiFiand eth1 having its DHCP address from the main network right ? And that could solve the printers problem. I will try that
