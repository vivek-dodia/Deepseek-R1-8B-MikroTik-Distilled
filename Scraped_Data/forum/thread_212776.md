Well... Mikrotik has two (actually three) wireless drivers:wireless - works with 802.11n and ac capable deviceswifi-qcom-ac - works only with ac devices and enables some additional features compared to wirelesswifi-qcom - works with ax devicesAs Mikrotik publishes the above:https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... 2BpackagesYou currently have BOTH wireless and wifi-qcom installed, and only wireless is enabled. As written above: this DOES NOT support your device.What you need to do: uninstall wireless and enable qcom-ac. You will need to reboot for it to take effect.Your wifi interfaces will appear. If you want default configuration, you will probably have to do a "reset to defaults" thingy (either with reset button or from menu...)Hope this helps!

Yes, after a few hours of experiments, I realized what had happened and corrected the situation. The model page to download offers wrong files, this is what caused my difficulties. Before the manual upgrade, I should have seen which packages are installed in this model. Thank you!page.jpg

That's the page forAC3.You can tell seeing arm version instead of arm64.Different thing.Page for AX3 is correct.And the only correct driver for AX3 is wifi-qcom.NOT wifi-qcom-ac.

Yep. Ax3 does have the correct packages.I'm still at a loss as to what could have happened, because obviously arm packages wouldn't have installed at all...

Damn it! That’s right. I made the problem myself. It was a night, I was tired. ARM packages were not installed, so I went and found ARM64, the wrong package "wireless" on inertia. Then looked at the logs that he wants "Wi-Fi-qcom", gave him. Well and then you know.
