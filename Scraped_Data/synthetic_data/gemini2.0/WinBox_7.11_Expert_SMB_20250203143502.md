Okay, let's craft some detailed documentation for WinBox configuration in the context of your specified MikroTik setup.

## Scenario Description:

We will focus on setting up a VLAN interface (vlan-87) with a subnet of 190.111.191.0/24 on a MikroTik router using WinBox. We'll walk through the process of creating this interface, assigning an IP address, and ensuring it's operational. This scenario is common in SMB environments where VLANs are used for network segmentation. The target is to fully configure this using WinBox for all steps, while also demonstrating the equivalent CLI commands and detailing the REST API access.

## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Accessing the Router and Finding Interfaces

*   **Action:** Open WinBox, connect to your MikroTik Router.
    *   **Before:** The router should be online and reachable via its IP or MAC address. You have the correct username/password to log in.
    *   **Effect:** Winbox connects to the router and displays the interface list and other relevant information.
    *   **WinBox GUI:** Log into your router using Winbox, navigating to `Interfaces` under the menu options.
    *   **CLI Equivalent (for reference):** ` /interface print`
    *   **Note:** Ensure you are connected to the MikroTik using a network interface which allows communication.

### Step 2: Creating the VLAN Interface

*   **Action:** Create a new VLAN interface named `vlan-87`.
    *   **Before:** You have a physical interface ready to have a VLAN assigned.  This is most commonly `ether1`.
    *   **Effect:**  A new logical interface will be created that is tagged with VLAN ID 87 on the selected physical interface, making it appear in the interface list.
    *   **WinBox GUI:**
        1.  Click the "+" button (Add New) in the `Interfaces` window.
        2.  Select `VLAN` from the drop down menu.
        3.  In the `Name` field, enter `vlan-87`.
        4.  In the `VLAN ID` field, enter `87`.
        5.  In the `Interface` field, select the desired parent interface (e.g., `ether1`).
        6.  Click `Apply`, then `OK`.
    *   **CLI Equivalent:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan
    add name=vlan-87 vlan-id=87 interface=ether1
    ```
    *   **Note:** Replace `ether1` with your chosen physical interface. Verify the parent interface in the `Interfaces` list first.

### Step 3: Assigning an IP Address to the VLAN Interface

*   **Action:** Assign an IP address of 190.111.191.1/24 to `vlan-87`.
    *   **Before:** `vlan-87` exists as an interface with no IP address.
    *   **Effect:** The interface `vlan-87` will now have a valid IP address in the subnet 190.111.191.0/24, allowing devices on this VLAN to communicate with this router.
    *   **WinBox GUI:**
        1.  Navigate to `IP` then `Addresses`.
        2.  Click the "+" button to add a new IP address.
        3.  In the `Address` field, enter `190.111.191.1/24`.
        4.  In the `Interface` field, select `vlan-87`.
        5.  Click `Apply`, then `OK`.
    *   **CLI Equivalent:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=190.111.191.1/24 interface=vlan-87
    ```
    *   **Note:**  The IP address can be adjusted for your specific requirements.

### Step 4: Enabling the VLAN Interface

*   **Action:** Ensure the VLAN interface is enabled.
    *   **Before:**  `vlan-87` interface exists but may be disabled.
    *   **Effect:** The interface is fully operational and ready for traffic.
    *   **WinBox GUI:**
         1.  Navigate to `Interfaces`.
        2.  Ensure the checkbox under the `Enabled` column next to the `vlan-87` interface is ticked (or highlighted).
    *   **CLI Equivalent:**
        ```mikrotik
        /interface enable vlan-87
        ```
    *   **Note:** Typically an interface is enabled upon creation, however, it is good practice to check.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-87 vlan-id=87 interface=ether1
/ip address
add address=190.111.191.1/24 interface=vlan-87
/interface enable vlan-87
```

*   **`/interface vlan add name=vlan-87 vlan-id=87 interface=ether1`**:
    *   `name=vlan-87`: Sets the name of the VLAN interface to `vlan-87`.
    *   `vlan-id=87`: Specifies the VLAN ID to be `87`.
    *   `interface=ether1`: Assigns the VLAN interface to the physical interface `ether1`. Replace `ether1` with the relevant physical interface.
*   **`/ip address add address=190.111.191.1/24 interface=vlan-87`**:
    *   `address=190.111.191.1/24`: Sets the IP address and subnet mask for the interface to `190.111.191.1` with a `/24` mask.
    *   `interface=vlan-87`: Applies the IP address to the interface named `vlan-87`.
*    **`/interface enable vlan-87`**:
    *   `enable vlan-87`: Enables the logical interface `vlan-87`.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Incorrect VLAN ID:** Double-check the VLAN ID (87). Mismatches will prevent communication.
    *   **Solution:** Verify the VLAN ID on the switch side, and correct in the MikroTik VLAN interface.
*   **Parent Interface Wrong:** Ensure the correct physical interface is selected.
    *   **Solution:** Examine your topology, and check the correct interfaces. Update the VLAN parent interface.
*   **IP Address Conflict:** Ensure that the IP address is not already in use on your network.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure no other device is using the same IP, and verify the IP is within your target subnet.
*  **Interface Disabled:** Check that the interface is not disabled, and enabled correctly.
    *  **Solution:** Enable the interface through WinBox or CLI.
*   **Firewall Issues:** Check that your firewall rules are not blocking traffic on the new VLAN.
    *   **Solution:** Add or modify firewall rules that allows the required traffic through, and double-check your input/output chains.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Ping the VLAN Interface:** Ping `190.111.191.1` from a device on that VLAN. If you can ping the router on the vlan, the ip address and interface is working correctly.
    *   **WinBox Tools:** Open a `New Terminal` in Winbox, and type: `ping 190.111.191.1`
    *   **CLI:** `ping 190.111.191.1`
2.  **Traceroute:** Use `traceroute` or `tracert` to check the path to the VLAN gateway.
    *   **WinBox Tools:** `traceroute 190.111.191.1`
    *  **CLI:** `traceroute 190.111.191.1`
3.  **Torch:** Use `/tool torch` on the router to analyze traffic on `vlan-87` to see if traffic is reaching the router.
    *   **WinBox Tools:** `Tools`, `Torch` and select `vlan-87`
    *   **CLI:** `/tool torch interface=vlan-87`

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server:** Set up a DHCP server on `vlan-87` to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on the VLAN.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to control traffic to and from `vlan-87`.
*   **Routing:** Configure routing to allow communication between `vlan-87` and other networks.

The impact of this configuration is to separate network traffic on a specific VLAN, which can help in isolating different departments within an SMB or improving network security by segmenting network devices.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

Here are examples of REST API calls for the above setup. Note that these APIs may vary between RouterOS versions. Ensure that you have the REST API access enabled on the router under `IP`-> `Services`.

### Creating the VLAN interface

*   **API Endpoint:** `/interface/vlan`
*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "vlan-87",
        "vlan-id": 87,
        "interface": "ether1"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (200 OK):** A JSON response confirming the creation:

    ```json
    {
        "message": "added",
        "id": "*1"
    }
    ```
*   **Error handling:** If a parameter is wrong, you'll get a response such as:
   ```json
   {
       "message": "input does not match required type",
       "details": {
          "0": "vlan-id - must be integer [1..4094]"
        }
   }
   ```

### Adding an IP address

*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
    {
        "address": "190.111.191.1/24",
        "interface": "vlan-87"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Response (200 OK):** A JSON response confirming the IP address creation:

    ```json
    {
         "message": "added",
        "id": "*1"
    }
    ```
*   **Error handling:** If a parameter is wrong, you'll get a response such as:
   ```json
   {
       "message": "input does not match required type",
       "details": {
          "0": "address - input does not match required type (IPv4 address/netmask)",
          "1": "interface - not found"
        }
    }
   ```

### Enabling the interface
*   **API Endpoint:** `/interface`
*   **Request Method:** PUT
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
   ```json
   {
       ".id": "*1",
       "disabled": false
    }
   ```
* **Expected Response (200 OK):** A JSON response confirming the enable interface action.
   ```json
    {
       "message": "updated"
    }
   ```
*  **Error handling:** If a parameter is wrong, you'll get a response such as:
   ```json
    {
       "message": "invalid id"
    }
   ```

**Important Note:** The `.id` parameter is required for PUT requests to modify an existing item. This id can be found when listing the interfaces using the API.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the routerâ€™s management interfaces and API from trusted IPs.
*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong passwords for all user accounts, and change default passwords.
*   **HTTPS/SSH:** Always use secure protocols (HTTPS for WebFig, SSH for CLI).
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS version updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Firewall:** Implement a strict firewall policy to restrict unwanted traffic.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **More complex firewall rules:** The setup currently lacks specific firewall rules for this newly created VLAN, which is required in a production setup.
*   **DHCP Server:** A DHCP server setup on the new interface would make it easier to add new devices.
*   **Specific Traffic Shaping:** Implement traffic shaping for the interface to optimize bandwidth usage.
*   **Monitoring:** Add monitoring and logging for the new interface.
*   **Automated configuration**: Use the API to create automated configuration based on a dynamic system.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

*   **WinBox:** A graphical user interface (GUI) application used to configure MikroTik routers. It is available for Windows and it provides a simple to use interface to access all of the router settings.
*   **VLAN (Virtual LAN):** A logical network that segments traffic within a physical network. VLANs use tags to differentiate traffic on the same physical wire. In this example, `vlan-87` is a virtual network where traffic has the tag of 87 on the physical interface `ether1`.
*   **Interface:** A networking interface within the router, which can be physical or virtual (like VLANs). It is a place where network traffic can be sent and received.
*   **IP Address:**  A unique address used to identify devices on a network. In this case `190.111.191.1/24` is an address assigned to the `vlan-87` interface, on the local network it exists on.
*   **Subnet Mask:**  A mask used to determine the network portion of an IP address, defined in this case as `/24`.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **WinBox vs CLI:** WinBox is user-friendly but the CLI provides more power and precision for complex tasks. The CLI can often be quicker, and scripting of commands can be done to easily reconfigure devices.
*   **VLAN vs Subnet:** VLANs are a Layer 2 segmentation, that can be combined with IP subnets. You can have different subnets per VLAN. If you do not use a VLAN, all devices would be on the same physical network segment.
*   **VLAN Tagging:** For this scenario we are using 802.1q VLAN tagging. This is a standard for sending packets between devices that use VLANs. Without it, the device must be directly connected without VLANs, or on the native VLAN.
*   **IP Addressing:** Using a /24 subnet means we can have up to 254 devices on the VLAN, which might be too much for a small setup, or too little for a large setup. A different CIDR can change the maximum number of devices you can have on the network.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is valid for RouterOS versions 7.x and 6.48 as the commands and syntax for VLANs, IPs, interfaces etc have not substantially changed in these versions. If targeting RouterOS versions before 6.48, some commands and/or interfaces may have to be adjusted. For example, older versions may use bridge-ports rather than interfaces.
Ensure you test your configuration in a non-production environment before deploying it to production.
