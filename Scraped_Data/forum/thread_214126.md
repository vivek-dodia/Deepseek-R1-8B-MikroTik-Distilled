Hi Folks,We have two redundant Mikrotik RB5009 routers setup to act as our OVPN servers. We are using TCP port 443 to receive OVPN connections from the staff OVPN client apps.The symptoms on client side during the issue is that they will see server timeout while they cycle through trying our two OVPN server IPs on the two RB5009. On RB5009 side, we observed with packet sniffer that the TCP SYN for the OVPN connection is arriving at the Mikrotik, but not being responded to. This suggests to me that the transit network between client and server is not our issue, and that whatever is happening is on the RB5009, since I do not see it replying with SYN ACK to get through the 3 way handshake.Without any change on either side, maybe after 5-20 minutes, things will start working again, and we will see the TCP 3 way handshake complete and everything works as normal. The packet sniffer is able to see the TCP SYN and TCP SYN ACK and TCP ACK at this point too, without any changes to the filter.My first concern is that I'm dropping the SYN ACK for some reason on my firewall rules. I'm not sure where else to look for my intermittently absent SYN ACKs.Code:Select all/ip firewall filteraddaction=fasttrack-connection chain=forward comment=fasttrack \

There does not seem to be IP addresses nor usernames shown in the OVPN debug, so I'm not sure what each entry correlates to in terms of my incoming client connections.I'd also assert that authentication and such don't happen until the TCP 3-way handshake completes, right?Could I be reaching a throughput limit on my RB5009 routers? I notice that at the moment my OVPN connections are lopsided, such that vpn1 has 50 connections up, and vpn2 has 80 connections up. Over several disconnects and reconnects, it seems that we time out often on vpn2, and usually wind up on vpn1 - suggesting that maybe vpn2 has reached a threshold limit perhaps and is rejecting the new connections due to capacity?For the time being, I am sidestepping my TCP handshake issue. Thankfully in the 7.17 firmware update Mikrotik added multiple instances of OVPN server to be active, where previously we had been restricted to only one choice of UDP or TCP and port. I'm updating my RB5009 to accept both UDP and TCP now, and so my clients are trying UDP first and not falling prey to this strange TCP handshake trouble I'm observing.

Are there log messages like "possible SYN flooding on tcp port ...‚Äù at the time the connection breaks or before?I have a similar issue, as you know, and figured out, that something is wrong, if there are to "many" (5-10 per second) tcp syn packets from one sourceviewtopic.php?p=1116612#p1116612
