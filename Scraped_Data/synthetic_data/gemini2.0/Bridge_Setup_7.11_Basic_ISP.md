## Bridge Setup in MikroTik RouterOS

### Implementation:

**Step 1: Create a Bridge Interface**

Create a new bridge interface in the Interfaces menu (IP -> Interfaces -> +):
```
/interface bridge add name=my-bridge
```

**Step 2: Add Physical Interfaces to the Bridge**

Move the desired physical interfaces to the newly created bridge:
```
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=my-bridge interface=ether2
```

**Step 3: Enable Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**

For redundancy and loop avoidance, enable STP on the bridge:
```
/interface bridge settings set bridge=my-bridge stp-enabled=yes
```

**Step 4: Set Bridge Parameters (Optional)**

Configure the age time, bridge ID, and other parameters as needed:
```
/interface bridge settings set bridge=my-bridge forward-delay=15
/interface bridge settings set bridge=my-bridge hello-time=2
/interface bridge settings set bridge=my-bridge max-age=20
```

### Verification and Testing:

**Step 1: Check Bridge Status**

Verify the bridge status and members:
```
/interface bridge print
```

**Step 2: Test Communication**

Ping devices connected to the bridge interfaces to confirm connectivity:
```
/ping 192.168.1.10
```

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

**Pitfall:** Configuring a loop in the bridge topology.

**Solution:** Ensure that there are no physical loops or accidental bridging of interfaces. Use STP to prevent network loops.

**Pitfall:** Configuring incorrect STP parameters.

**Solution:** Use default values or consult vendor documentation for recommended settings based on your network size and complexity.

**Pitfall:** Overlooking security considerations.

**Solution:** Secure the bridge by disabling unused ports, configuring MAC address filtering, and implementing appropriate firewall rules.

### Related Features and Considerations:

* **VLANs:** Bridges can be used to segment network traffic into VLANs.
* **Port Isolation:** Bridges can prevent communication between specific ports to enhance security.
* **Link Aggregation:** Bridges can be used to combine multiple physical links into a single logical interface for increased bandwidth and redundancy.
