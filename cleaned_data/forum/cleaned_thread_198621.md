## Initial Question
Apparently there is a vacancy in Latvia!He has the charm and charisma and his sidekick Vicktors could be Minister of Arts, any takers on other positions in the cabinet?? ---

## Response 1
BTW, there is no vacancy for President, only for Prime Minister (Ministru prezidents) in Latvia. ---

## Response 2
Well, one can't expect fire-breathing donkey to understand the difference. After all, in Canada they don't have any kind of president, only Governor General and Prime Minister. ---

## Response 3
Okay wise asses, I have corrected my faux pas. Maybe I was testing if you were paying attention. '=)Now besides Vicktors for Minister of Arts, peruse the other MT staff and decide which cabinet post they should get!! ---

I am more curious as to what Normands is thinking.....Attempt1: I forgot my schnapps in the car.........Attempt2: I always have my hand in my pocket to protect my manhood.....Attempt3: Where is the bathroom?Attempt4: Why did I volunteer to attend this event for Viktors...... ---

## Response 8
Attempt4: Why did I volunteer to attend this event for Viktors......I think the PM's drug-sniff dogs excluded him from the event. ---

## Response 9
Attempt4: Why did I volunteer to attend this event for Viktors......I think the PM's drug-sniff dogs excluded him from the event.... it reads "volunteer" ... which begs for question: whom did drug-sniffing dogs exclude: Normunds, Viktors, both or themselves? ---
