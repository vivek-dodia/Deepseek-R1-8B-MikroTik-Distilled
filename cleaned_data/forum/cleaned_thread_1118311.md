What do you mean by stencils, are you referring to item templates that can be used with Visio?The first hit I got on stencils is this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil ---

@LFHarada â€“ you could ask sales and marketing for any product brochures at 'sales@mikrotik.com' or use the product galleries to import pics into Visio, for example:https://mikrotik.com/product/crs504_4xq ... tn-gallery. ---
