Ummm this is super easy. All you do is add a static route on MikroTik 1 pointing to MikroTik 2But MikroTik 2 still needs to have an address. Normally on the link between MikroTik 1 and 2 you would give them a private IPi.e. 10.0.12.1/30 and 10.0.12.2/30Then on MikroTik1 you just add your static route/ip route add dst-address=2.3.4.0/29 gateway=10.0.12.2Make sure on MikroTik1 you are not using NAT'ing this range when going back out to ISP1i.e. if you just have a basic masquerade rule like/ip firewall nat chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masqueradeYou either need to modify the rule to exclude public IP addresses, or just add a rule above it so it doesn't trigger the normal masquerade/ip firewall nat chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 src-address=2.3.4.0/29 action=acceptMikroTik 2 you can then do whatever you want with the IP addresses. If you assign to a loopback it will work and respond, or you can assign to customers with PPPoE etc-------------------------------------If for some reason you don't want a private IP range between MikroTik1 and 2 (maybe because you only want public IP's to show up in traceroute) you can use /32 addresses on both with a static route so you are not wasting any, only using 1 address. These can be entirely different network ranges, its totally valid to have 1.2.3.4 and 5.6.7.8 talking to each otherMikroTik1: (assuming ether2 connects to MikroTik 2)/ip address add address=1.2.3.4/32 interface=ether2/ip route add dst-address=2.3.4.5/32 gateway=ether2/ip route add dst-address=2.3.4.0/29 gateway=2.3.4.5MikroTik2:/ip address add address=2.3.4.5/32 interface=ether2/ip route add dst-address=1.2.3.4/32 interface=ether2/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=1.2.3.4The rest of the available IP's (0/1/2/3/4/6/7) can be assigned however you want on MikroTik2, to customers, different interfaces etcMany routers support /32 addressing, MikroTik does. Works totally fine (yet ironically does not support /31 properly)

```
/ip route add dst-address=XX.YYY.ZZZ.162/29 gateway=10.0.12.2
value of dst-address must have all host bits zero, as in XX.YYY.ZZZ.160/29
```

Probably I made a mistake somewhere, I'll go with your solution and let you know about the result.Thanks!***Update***Both of the method has worked just as intended, thank you millenium7!I just had a small issue with IP block, my ISP gave me an IP block such as; XX.YYY.ZZZ.162/30 (static routed to my main GW). When I tried to add it to my Route List, I got the following error;Code:Select allSo after changing 162 part to 160, it accepted and also it started to work.Now I need to Figure out how to use PPPoE Concentrator on M2 while M1 as its NAT Mikrotik

If its not working then consider traffic in 'both' directionsIt's very simple to create a new 'bridge' with no ports assigned to it (thats the closest thing to a 'loopback' interface in the MikroTik world) and then just put a single IP address from that range on there as a /32Then check your routing table on other routers. If that route shows up, saying to go to that router, then ur all good (it doesn't matter if ur block is a /24, /28, /29 or just a single /32 its all irrelevant, forget about network/broadcast addresses, you just need to know that the route is there)So try and ping it from 'inside' your network (those 3 routers). Can they ping that address? if yes, ur good to go on the 'inbound' direction. In that your ISP should be able to send traffic to R1-Core and R1-Core will forward it on as neededHowever the return path can mess you upVery first thing to consider.... NAT...If you have a NAT rule of 'masquerade' or 'srcnat' and its applying to all ur outbound traffic, then its going to screw up the return path (traffic comes in as 1.2.3.4 but when it leaves back to ISP it becomes 5.6.7.8 or whatever your primary IP is)Easiest method to deal with this is to add a rule 'above' that NAT rule with type of 'accept' and matching ur additional public IP addresses. This meaning it will not NAT and change the IP address when leaving back out to ISPIf ur sure thats also fine, then it must be a firewall filter rule or something else stopping traffic flow
