Okay, let's dive deep into configuring PPP AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) on a MikroTik router running RouterOS 6.48 (while being mindful of compatibility with RouterOS 7.x) for an ISP environment, specifically focusing on the provided subnet and interface. This will be an advanced-level configuration.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up a MikroTik router as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) for an ISP. The ISP uses a public subnet `140.168.235.0/24` for its customer-facing interface.  We will use interface `bridge-17` as the point where PPP clients connect. AAA functionality will be provided via a RADIUS server. This setup assumes we are not dealing with a huge amount of users simultaneously as RADIUS is not very scalable. The PPP users are expected to have a username and password which is verified against our radius server.

## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Create the Bridge Interface

**Description:** We create a bridge interface, which will bundle different types of interfaces to act as one single broadcast domain. In our case the PPPoE/PPTP users will interface with our network through this interface.

**Before:**  No `bridge-17` interface exists.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-17
```

**MikroTik Winbox:** Navigate to `Bridge` under `Interfaces`. Click the `+` button, enter `bridge-17` in the Name field and click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** A new bridge interface named `bridge-17` will exist, however it will still be inactive since we have no member ports.

**Effect:** This creates the necessary logical interface for our PPP connections.

### Step 2: Configure IP Address on the Bridge Interface

**Description:** We assign an IP address to the bridge. This IP address will act as a gateway for the PPP users.

**Before:** Bridge interface `bridge-17` exists, but has no IP address.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=140.168.235.1/24 interface=bridge-17
```

**MikroTik Winbox:** Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`. Click the `+` button, enter `140.168.235.1/24` in the Address field, select `bridge-17` from the Interface dropdown, and click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** Interface `bridge-17` now has an IP address of 140.168.235.1 with a /24 mask.

**Effect:** The bridge interface is now reachable, and it serves as the gateway for connected clients.

### Step 3: Configure a RADIUS Server

**Description:**  We configure the MikroTik router to communicate with a RADIUS server to authenticate, authorize, and account for PPP sessions. This example is using a fictional RADIUS server with the IP address of `192.168.100.100`, which is assumed to be accessible from our router.

**Before:** No RADIUS server is configured.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/radius
add address=192.168.100.100 secret="your_radius_secret" service=ppp timeout=10
```

**MikroTik Winbox:** Navigate to `Radius` under `PPP`. Click the `+` button. In the `Address` field, enter `192.168.100.100`, in the `Secret` field, enter your shared secret `your_radius_secret`, check the `ppp` box under the service field, change the timeout to `10`, and click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** The router can attempt to communicate with a configured RADIUS server.

**Effect:** The router is now prepared to use the RADIUS server for PPP AAA. Note, it is important that the secret is secured.

### Step 4: Create PPP Profiles

**Description:** PPP profiles define settings for our PPP users, such as DNS servers, default route, and local address. In our example, we provide DNS server addresses of `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`. Also in order to prevent the local address being the default, we set the local address pool to `none`.

**Before:** No PPP profiles are configured.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ppp profile
add name=ppp_profile_01 local-address=none remote-address=ppp_pool_01 use-encryption=required dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
/ip pool
add name=ppp_pool_01 ranges=140.168.235.2-140.168.235.254
```

**MikroTik Winbox:**  Navigate to `PPP` -> `Profiles`. Click the `+` button. In the `Name` field, enter `ppp_profile_01`. In the `Local Address` field, select `none`.  In the `Remote Address` field, select the address pool `ppp_pool_01`, or create the address pool in `IP` -> `Pool` under the `+` button, and name it `ppp_pool_01`, and add range `140.168.235.2-140.168.235.254`. In `DNS Servers` input `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`. Select `required` for `Use Encryption`. click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** PPP profiles with a default setting exist, and will be used for PPP authentication. An IP Pool also exists, and will be used as the address range for PPP users.

**Effect:**  PPP connections will use the specified profiles when a user connects.

### Step 5: Configure PPP Secret (For testing purposes only)

**Description:** For testing, we will create a local secret to be used if the RADIUS server cannot be reached. In a production setup, this step should not be needed.

**Before:** No PPP secrets exist for testing.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/ppp secret
add name=test_user password=test_password service=pppoe profile=ppp_profile_01
```

**MikroTik Winbox:** Navigate to `PPP` -> `Secrets`. Click the `+` button. In the `Name` field, enter `test_user`, in the `Password` field, enter `test_password`, in the `Service` field select `pppoe`, and select `ppp_profile_01` for the profile. click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** There is a single PPP secret entry in the router's config.

**Effect:** We can test PPP connection without a RADIUS server.

### Step 6: Configure PPP Server (PPPoE example)

**Description:** We configure a PPPoE server instance, which will be bound to the created bridge interface. We use the default profile and allow encryption.

**Before:** No PPP server exists.

**MikroTik CLI:**
```mikrotik
/interface pppoe-server server
add service-name=pppoe-isp interface=bridge-17 default-profile=ppp_profile_01 enabled=yes
```

**MikroTik Winbox:** Navigate to `PPP` -> `PPPoE Servers`. Click the `+` button. Under the `Service Name` field enter `pppoe-isp`. Select `bridge-17` from the `Interface` dropdown. Select `ppp_profile_01` from the `Default Profile` dropdown. Make sure the `Enabled` checkbox is selected. Click `Apply` and `OK`.

**After:** PPPoE server is set up and listening on the bridge interface.

**Effect:** Client connections using PPPoE should now be possible, with authentication provided by RADIUS.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **RADIUS Connectivity Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** The router cannot reach the RADIUS server.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Verify network connectivity using `ping 192.168.100.100` from the MikroTik CLI.
        *   Check firewall rules to ensure they allow communication to the RADIUS server.
        *   Double-check that the shared secret matches on the MikroTik and the RADIUS server.
        *   Verify there is no NAT causing issues with the RADIUS communication.
*   **Incorrect Shared Secret:**
    *   **Problem:** Authentication fails due to mismatched secrets between the router and the RADIUS server.
    *   **Solution:** Re-enter the secret on both the router and RADIUS server to ensure they are identical.
*   **PPP Profile Mismatch:**
    *   **Problem:** PPP clients fail to connect, or receive incorrect network configuration (like no DNS).
    *   **Solution:** Double-check all of the values in the profile, like IP address pool, DNS servers, etc.
*  **IP Pool Exhaustion**:
    *   **Problem:** New PPP clients are unable to connect because all the IP addresses in the pool are taken.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the pool is large enough, or use a larger subnet. Consider enabling dynamic address allocation on the radius server.
*  **RADIUS Response Time**:
    *   **Problem:** RADIUS server is slow to respond, leading to authentication timeouts.
    *   **Solution:** Increase the RADIUS timeout on the Mikrotik, and investigate the reasons for RADIUS slowness.
*  **CPU or memory issues**:
    *  **Problem**: High CPU and Memory Usage due to many PPP users connecting.
    *  **Solution**: Monitor the CPU/RAM load on your router, using monitoring tools like `Tool -> Profile`, `Tool->Graphing` and `Tool->Torch`. Consider using an upgrate hardware model or using more powerful network infrastructure.
*  **Security Issues**:
    *  **Problem**: Security issues, such as insecure password, or unencrypted passwords.
    *  **Solution**: Use strong passwords, and verify that encryption is forced in PPP.
*  **Missing Routes**:
    * **Problem:** Clients may not be able to route to the internet.
    * **Solution**: Ensure a default route is created, or a route is created for the specific subnets they need to access.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **RADIUS Server Connectivity:**
    *   Use the `ping 192.168.100.100` command from the MikroTik CLI to verify reachability to the RADIUS server.
2.  **RADIUS Test Authentication:**
    *   Use the `/radius test username=test_user password=test_password service=ppp` command from the MikroTik CLI to test RADIUS authentication.
    *   Successful results will be indicated in the output. If the request fails, investigate the shared secret configuration.
3.  **PPP Connection Test:**
    *   Use a PPPoE client to establish a connection, using username `test_user` and password `test_password`.
    *   Monitor the `/ppp active print` output for new connections. Verify that the IP address is from the configured pool.
    *   If testing with a RADIUS authentication, ensure there is a corresponding entry on the RADIUS server side.
4.  **Ping Testing:**
    *   Use the `ping` command to verify reachability from the connected client to the bridge address (140.168.235.1), and out to the internet.
5.  **IP Address Assignment:**
    *   Verify that the client receives an IP address from the range defined in `ppp_pool_01`. Check `/ip address print` and `/ip pool print` output.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **User Profiles**: Use user profiles on the radius server to limit the bandwidth, packet shaping and time constraints for specific users.
*   **Hotspot System**: MikroTik's hotspot feature can be used in combination with PPP to create a more advanced authentication system, with billing and data limits.
*  **VRF**: Virtual Routing and Forwarding can be used to isolate customer traffic, if required.
*   **Accounting**:  Ensure RADIUS accounting is properly configured to track the bandwidth usage of the PPP clients.
*  **Scripting**: Automatic connection handling, or custom notifications can be provided with MikroTik's scripting capabilities.
* **Backup/failover**: To improve reliability it is recommended to have a backup server or other means to authenticate user.
*   **Monitoring**: Use tools such as SNMP or the API to constantly monitor the status and the resources used by the router.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

For PPP configurations, the REST API can be useful for automation and remote management. Here's a simple example of creating a new PPP profile using the REST API (note that due to complexity, full API capabilities are not fully exposed):

* **API Endpoint:** `/ppp/profiles`
* **Request Method:** POST
* **Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
    "name": "ppp_api_profile",
    "local-address": "none",
    "remote-address": "ppp_pool_01",
    "use-encryption": "required",
     "dns-server": "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4"
}

```

* **Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
    ".id":"*6",
    "name":"ppp_api_profile",
    "use-encryption":"required",
    "only-one":"no",
    "address-list":"",
    "local-address":"none",
    "remote-address":"ppp_pool_01",
     "dns-server":"8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4",
    "change-tcp-mss":"yes",
     "rate-limit":"none",
    "on-up":"",
    "on-down":"",
    "use-mpls":"no"
}
```

* **API Endpoint:** `/ppp/profiles`
* **Request Method:** GET
* **Example JSON Payload:** No payload required.
* **Expected Response (Success):**

```json
[
    {
        ".id": "*6",
        "name": "ppp_api_profile",
        "use-encryption": "required",
        "only-one": "no",
        "address-list": "",
        "local-address": "none",
        "remote-address": "ppp_pool_01",
         "dns-server": "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4",
        "change-tcp-mss": "yes",
         "rate-limit": "none",
        "on-up": "",
        "on-down": "",
        "use-mpls": "no"
    },
   {
        ".id": "*7",
        "name": "ppp_profile_01",
        "use-encryption": "required",
        "only-one": "no",
        "address-list": "",
        "local-address": "none",
        "remote-address": "ppp_pool_01",
         "dns-server": "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4",
        "change-tcp-mss": "yes",
         "rate-limit": "none",
        "on-up": "",
        "on-down": "",
        "use-mpls": "no"
    }
]

```

* **Error Handling:** If there is an error, such as an incorrect IP address, or missing required field, the API will provide a detailed error object. Check the error for further details.

* Note:  This API needs to be enabled using `/ip service enable api`.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Use Strong RADIUS Secrets:** Implement complex and lengthy shared secrets for RADIUS communication.
*   **Force Encryption:** Always enable encryption for PPP connections to protect user credentials.
*   **Firewall Protection:** Ensure the MikroTik router has a proper firewall configured to protect against unauthorized access to critical services, and the RADIUS server.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep the RouterOS firmware updated to protect against the latest security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure API:** If enabling the API, ensure proper authentication is configured and use secure protocols like HTTPS.
*   **Limit Access to the Router:** Implement strong passwords and limit access to the router to authorized personal.
* **Disable unnecessary services**: Disable all the unused services such as `api-ssl` or `www-ssl` if you are not using them.
*   **Monitor System Logs:** Periodically check system logs for any unusual activity.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration is a solid foundation for a basic ISP network setup. However, it could be improved:

*   **Scalability:** For very large scale deployments,  a more scalable radius implementation should be used.
*   **Advanced Shaping:** Implement advanced packet shaping and queuing using queues to provide service guarantees to clients.
*  **VRF Support:** Introduce VRF support to isolate customer traffic.
*  **Dynamic Addressing**: Make use of dynamic address allocation with RADIUS to improve network management.
*  **Automation**: Automate the configuration and management with scripting and the API interface.
* **Redundancy**: Introduce redundancy for all the components.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

**PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):** PPP is a data link layer protocol used to establish a direct connection between two network nodes. It's widely used in dial-up, DSL, and VPN connections. PPP is a full fledged protocol that includes authentication, encryption and compression. In MikroTik, PPP can be used with different mediums, such as PPPoE or PPTP.

**AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):** AAA is a framework that controls access to computer resources, enforces policies, and audits usage.
*   **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., username and password).
*   **Authorization:** Determines what a user is allowed to do (e.g., bandwidth limits, allowed services).
*   **Accounting:** Tracks the usage of resources (e.g., bandwidth, time connected).
*   **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):** RADIUS is a centralized protocol used to implement AAA functionalities. RADIUS clients send authentication requests to the RADIUS server, which responds with authorization and accounting information.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Local Secrets vs RADIUS:** Local secrets are simpler to configure but lack centralized management and scalability, while RADIUS provides better control and scalability, however has added configuration and requires external infrastructure.

*   **PPPoE vs PPTP:** PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) is generally preferred over PPTP (PPP Tunneling Protocol) for its robustness and better security. PPTP is deprecated due to security issues, and should be avoided unless strictly required for backwards compatibility.

*   **Encryption on PPP:**  Not using encryption can be a security risk. While it can save on router resources, it opens up security issues for passwords to be read easily.

*   **Address Pools vs Dynamic Assignment**: Address Pools are very simple to set up, but not very flexible. Dynamic assignment from the RADIUS server is more scalable and easier to manage, but can be complex to set up initially.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration is targeted for RouterOS 6.48, and it will mostly work without issues on 7.x. However, there might be some slight differences, mostly in the command syntax. It should be noted that RouterOS version 7 onwards uses the `/interface/ppp` path for configuration, while the previous versions used `/ppp`.

*   **RouterOS 7.x Considerations:** While most of the configurations will work on both 6.48 and 7.x, ensure that for PPP interfaces, they are created with the new path in 7.x, such as `/interface/ppp/server/pppoe`. Always consult the official MikroTik documentation for the exact syntax on each version.

This detailed document should enable you to implement a robust PPP AAA setup on your MikroTik RouterOS device. Remember to adapt and customize it to your specific ISP requirements. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.
