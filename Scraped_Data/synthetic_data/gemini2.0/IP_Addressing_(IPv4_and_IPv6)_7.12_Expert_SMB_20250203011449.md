Okay, let's dive into this comprehensive MikroTik RouterOS documentation. This will be extensive, covering all requested areas, and will provide a detailed guide for a skilled administrator.

**Configuration Level:** Expert
**Network Scale:** SMB
**Target RouterOS Version:** 7.12 (with notes for 6.48 and general 7.x compatibility)
**Subnet:** 61.36.143.0/24
**Interface Name:** vlan-89

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**
We're configuring a MikroTik router for a small-to-medium business (SMB). The router acts as a gateway for a single VLAN (VLAN 89), which is associated with the 61.36.143.0/24 subnet. This VLAN might be used to segment a department's network, like marketing or a guest network. We'll cover all aspects of this setup, including IP addressing, VLAN configuration, and security considerations. The router will be expected to provide internet access to the hosts on this VLAN.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **VLAN Tagging:** The interface will be configured with VLAN ID 89.
*   **IP Addressing:** The interface will receive an IPv4 address from the 61.36.143.0/24 subnet.
*   **Gateway:** Router will act as the default gateway for this VLAN and perform NAT for outbound internet traffic.
*   **Security:**  Firewall rules will be configured to protect the network from external threats and control traffic flow.
*   **DHCP Server:** A DHCP server will be configured to automatically provide IP addresses to devices on the VLAN.
*   **DNS:** The router will also act as a DNS server.
*   **Basic Troubleshooting:**  We'll include standard commands for troubleshooting problems related to IP addressing and network issues.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)

Here's how to configure this scenario using both CLI and Winbox.

### 2.1. CLI Implementation

*   **Create VLAN Interface:**
    ```routeros
    /interface vlan add name=vlan-89 vlan-id=89 interface=ether1
    ```
    **Explanation:** This command creates a VLAN interface named "vlan-89" with a VLAN ID of 89, based on the physical interface "ether1". *Note: You should replace `ether1` with the interface to which your devices are connected.*

*   **Assign IPv4 Address to VLAN Interface:**
    ```routeros
    /ip address add address=61.36.143.1/24 interface=vlan-89
    ```
    **Explanation:**  This command assigns the IPv4 address 61.36.143.1/24 to the "vlan-89" interface.  This will be our router's IP on this network.

*   **Set the Gateway:**
    ```routeros
    /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.1.1
    ```
   **Explanation:** This command sets a default route, pointing traffic towards our assumed upstream gateway. Change `192.168.1.1` with your actual upstream gateway.

*   **Configure DHCP Server:**
    ```routeros
    /ip pool add name=dhcp_pool_vlan-89 ranges=61.36.143.100-61.36.143.200
    /ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp_vlan-89 address-pool=dhcp_pool_vlan-89 interface=vlan-89
    /ip dhcp-server network add address=61.36.143.0/24 gateway=61.36.143.1 dns-server=61.36.143.1
    ```
    **Explanation:**
      -   `ip pool add`: Creates a pool of IPs to give out, between .100 and .200 in this case.
      -   `ip dhcp-server add`: Creates the DHCP server instance on the VLAN.
      -   `ip dhcp-server network add`: Assigns the pool to the specified subnet on the vlan. Also tells clients which gateway and DNS to use.

*   **Enable NAT (Masquerade) for Outbound Traffic:**
   ```routeros
   /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=<Your internet-facing interface> src-address=61.36.143.0/24
   ```
    **Explanation:** This rule enables NAT for traffic originating from the 61.36.143.0/24 network, allowing devices on this network to connect to the internet. Replace `<Your internet-facing interface>` with the actual internet facing interface, such as pppoe-out1, ether2 or similar.
* **Basic Firewall Rules:**
   ```routeros
   /ip firewall filter
   add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Accept established and related input"
   add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept comment="Accept ICMP for troubleshooting"
   add chain=input in-interface=!vlan-89 action=drop comment="Drop all other input not destined for the router"
   add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept comment="Accept established and related forward"
   add chain=forward src-address=61.36.143.0/24 action=accept comment="Allow outbound traffic from this vlan"
   add chain=forward action=drop comment="Drop all other forward traffic"
   ```

```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

*   **Pitfall:** VLAN misconfiguration on the physical interface can lead to no connectivity. Ensure that the physical interface (`ether1` in our example) is correctly configured to handle VLAN-tagged traffic (e.g., if it's a trunk port).
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface print` to check the status of the interfaces. Use `/interface vlan print` to ensure VLAN ID is correct.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect IP address or netmask can prevent devices from communicating.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip address print` to verify that the correct IP address and mask are assigned to the VLAN interface.
*   **Pitfall:** Firewall rules blocking the desired traffic. Always start with accept all rules and add restrictions gradually.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip firewall filter print` to check existing rules. Use torch on the interface to verify if packets are being blocked.
*   **Pitfall:** DHCP server misconfiguration can cause client devices not to receive IP addresses.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip dhcp-server print` to verify DHCP settings.  Check DHCP logs: `/log print where topics~"dhcp"` and `/ip dhcp-server leases print` to check DHCP leases.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect NAT rules can cause internet access problems.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip firewall nat print` to check the NAT rule.  Use `/tool sniffer` to monitor traffic to see if packets are being mangled or if NAT is being applied.
*   **Error Scenario Example:**  If DHCP is not providing IPs, and the logs show “no pool on interface”, check the IP pools configuration. Incorrect ranges or an absence of an active pool will cause this. Ensure the range is available and that the `address-pool` matches your created pool.
*   **Diagnostics:**
    *   **Ping:** Use `/ping 61.36.143.1` from the router to check the local interface IP address. Ping devices on the VLAN.
    *   **Traceroute:** Use `/tool traceroute 8.8.8.8` to check the network path to an external host.
    *   **Torch:** Use `/tool torch interface=vlan-89` to monitor real-time traffic.
    *  **Packet Sniffer**: `/tool sniffer start file-name=vlan89.pcap duration=60 interface=vlan-89` to collect network data.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Check Interface Status:** Verify that the "vlan-89" interface is enabled and that its status is "running" using `/interface print`.
2.  **Check IP Address:** Verify that the address 61.36.143.1/24 is assigned to the "vlan-89" interface using `/ip address print`.
3.  **Ping Test:**  From a client on the 61.36.143.0/24 subnet, ping the router's IP address (61.36.143.1). Then ping internet addresses like `8.8.8.8` or `google.com`.
4.  **Traceroute Test:** Use `traceroute google.com` from the client to verify the network path.
5.  **DHCP Lease Verification:** On the router, verify that DHCP leases have been given out via `/ip dhcp-server leases print`. Also make sure that your client devices received IP addresses.
6.  **Firewall Logs:** If you have logging enabled, check for dropped packets to identify problems `/log print where topics~"firewall"`.
7.  **Network Connectivity Test:** From a machine on the 61.36.143.0/24 subnet, verify that you can access the internet and other network resources.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Bridging:**  If you needed to add more than one port to this VLAN, you would add that port to the bridge.
*   **MAC VLAN:**  You can use MAC VLANs to create virtual interfaces based on MAC addresses, which can be useful for certain types of network segmentation.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:**  Modern MikroTik hardware often has hardware offloading for Layer 3 routing functions. This can be enabled via the `/interface ethernet set ether1 l3-hw-offloading=yes` command.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:**  MikroTik bridges group multiple network interfaces to act as a single Layer 2 domain.  This simplifies network topology by enabling a single subnet to span multiple interfaces.
*   **Routing:** MikroTik routing uses a route table to forward traffic between subnets.  The default route points towards the upstream router. Policy-based routing can be used to route based on source or destination IPs.
*   **Firewall:**  The MikroTik firewall filters packets based on rules. It supports connection tracking, which greatly enhances security by allowing the router to differentiate new connections from existing ones.
*   **VLANs:** VLANs allow you to create isolated Layer 2 networks on the same physical infrastructure. The "vlan-id" tag in the packet header identifies which VLAN it belongs to. This logical segmentation is important for network security and organization.
*   **IP Addressing:** IP addressing is the foundation of network communication.  IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. We used the CIDR notation to indicate network sizes (e.g., /24).
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** NAT allows private addresses to communicate on the internet by translating their addresses to the router's public IP address (masquerading). It conserves public IP addresses and provides a degree of security.
*   **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses to client devices, simplifying network administration by centralizing address assignment.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **Change Default Credentials:**  Always change the default admin username and password.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable unused services such as Telnet and the default `www` service. Use HTTPS for web access and SSH for command line management.
*   **Restrict Access:** Use firewall rules to limit access to the router itself. Allow only necessary IP addresses to connect.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure API:** Enable HTTPS for the API, and use strong passwords for user accounts that access the API.  Use API tokens to limit permissions further.
*   **Disable RoMON (if not needed):** The RoMON protocol can be used to manage multiple MikroTik devices, but if it’s not needed, disable it.
* **Disable Neighbor discovery** disable this to prevent the router from advertising itself on local networks.
* **Enable Firewall Logging:** Log all dropped connections to identify potentially malicious traffic. Use logging to an external server for better security.
*   **Secure Wireless:** Use WPA3 if your hardware allows it.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for All MikroTik Topics

This section will expand upon each topic, providing detailed configurations and explanations.

### 10.1 IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

*   **IPv4:** We have covered the configuration of IPv4 in the previous example.  IPv4 is the most commonly used addressing protocol.
*   **IPv6:**
    *   To configure IPv6, first obtain an IPv6 prefix from your ISP.
    *   Assign an IPv6 address to your interface with a command similar to:
        ```routeros
        /ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=vlan-89
        ```
    *   Add a default route using IPv6 as a gateway:
        ```routeros
        /ipv6 route add dst-address=::/0 gateway=2001:db8::2
        ```
    *   Enable IPv6 forwarding:
        ```routeros
        /ipv6 settings set forward=yes
        ```
    *  Ensure that firewall rules are in place to allow ipv6 traffic.
    *   Note: IPv6 address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is an alternative to manual address assignment.
    *   Troubleshooting: Use `/ipv6 address print`, `/ipv6 route print`, `ping6` to check the ipv6 network.

### 10.2 IP Pools

*   IP pools are used for DHCP servers and can be used for IPsec pools.
*   Create an IP pool:
    ```routeros
    /ip pool add name=my_ip_pool ranges=192.168.10.10-192.168.10.100
    ```
*   Use a created pool:
    ```routeros
    /ip dhcp-server add address-pool=my_ip_pool ...
    ```

### 10.3 IP Routing

*   **Static Routing:** We have already configured static routing for the default gateway.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** MikroTik supports various dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, RIP, and BGP.
    *   **OSPF:**
        *   Add OSPF Instance:
            ```routeros
            /routing ospf instance add name=ospf-instance router-id=1.1.1.1
            ```
        *  Add OSPF Network:
           ```routeros
           /routing ospf network add network=192.168.1.0/24 area=backbone
           ```
        * Add OSPF interface:
            ```routeros
            /routing ospf interface add interface=vlan-89 instance=ospf-instance
            ```
    *   **RIP:**
        ```routeros
        /routing rip set enabled=yes
        /routing rip interface add interface=vlan-89
        ```
    *   **BGP:** BGP is more complex, typically used by larger networks. See the documentation on routing for more details.
*   **Policy Routing:** Policy routing allows you to route traffic based on source, destination or other parameters.
  * Example:
  ```routeros
    /ip route rule add src-address=192.168.1.5/32 action=lookup-only-in-table table=guest-table
    /ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=10.10.10.1 routing-mark=guest-table
  ```

*   **VRF:** Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) allows multiple routing tables on a single router to segregate traffic.
    *   Add VRF instance:
        ```routeros
        /routing vrf add name=vrf-1
        ```
    * Add interface to VRF:
        ```routeros
        /interface vlan set vlan-89 vrf-forwarding=vrf-1
        ```

### 10.4 IP Settings

*   Global IP settings are found at `/ip settings`.
    *   Set the routing-cache to "yes":
        ```routeros
        /ip settings set routing-cache=yes
        ```
    *   Change source validation if desired:
        ```routeros
        /ip settings set source-validation=any
        ```

### 10.5 MAC Server

*   MAC Server (for discovery) is disabled by default, but can be used for remote access via MAC address.
  *  Enable the server
      ```routeros
       /tool mac-server set enabled=yes
       ```
  * Restrict access to it
     ```routeros
       /tool mac-server access-list add addresses=10.0.0.0/24
      ```
*  **Security:** Enable MAC Server access lists to limit access to the router via MAC address.

### 10.6 RoMON

*   RoMON is the MikroTik Router Management protocol.  It allows managing multiple MikroTik routers from a single point.
*   It must be configured on each device and can be a security risk if not managed correctly.
*   **Security:** If not used disable it:
    ```routeros
    /tool romon set enabled=no
    ```

### 10.7 WinBox

*   WinBox is the GUI tool for managing MikroTik routers.
*   WinBox has no configuration in the router, but if you have problems connecting use IP and Mac connectivity or a WinBox version prior to 7.
*   **Security:** Use strong passwords and limit access to the router.

### 10.8 Certificates

*   MikroTik allows for the creation of certificates for secure communication such as IPsec and web access.
*   Generate a certificate:
  ```routeros
    /certificate add name=server-cert common-name=router.local generate-key=yes
  ```
*   Export certificates:
  ```routeros
    /certificate export file=my-cert.pem certificate=server-cert
   ```
*   Import certificates:
   ```routeros
    /certificate import file=my-cert.pem
   ```
*   **Security:** Use strong private keys and store them securely.

### 10.9 PPP AAA

*   PPP AAA allows you to use a AAA server like RADIUS for authentication.
    * Example (basic RADIUS configuration)
    ```routeros
    /ppp aaa set use-radius=yes accounting=yes interim-update=0
    /radius add address=10.0.0.5 secret=mysecret service=ppp
    ```

### 10.10 RADIUS

*   RADIUS provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for network access.
    *  Add radius server:
       ```routeros
        /radius add address=10.0.0.5 secret=mysecret service=ppp
       ```
*   **Security:** Secure communication with RADIUS by using a strong shared secret.

### 10.11 User / User groups

*  Users are used for access to the RouterOS or via other services like PPP, or User Manager.
* Create a user group:
    ```routeros
     /user group add name=mygroup policy=write,read,test
    ```
* Create a user:
    ```routeros
      /user add name=myuser password=mypassword group=mygroup
    ```
*  **Security:** Use strong passwords and set proper permissions per user group.

### 10.12 Bridging and Switching

*   **Bridging:** Bridge interfaces create a Layer 2 segment.
    *   Create a bridge:
        ```routeros
        /interface bridge add name=mybridge
        ```
    *  Add interface to a bridge:
        ```routeros
        /interface bridge port add bridge=mybridge interface=ether2
        /interface bridge port add bridge=mybridge interface=ether3
         ```
*   **Switching:** Some MikroTik hardware has dedicated switch chips.
  * Enable switch functions on an ethernet interface.
    ```routeros
        /interface ethernet switch set ether1 switch-all-ports=yes
   ```

### 10.13 MACVLAN

*   MACVLAN creates multiple virtual interfaces based on MAC addresses, using the same underlying physical interface.
    *   Create a MACVLAN Interface:
        ```routeros
        /interface macvlan add name=macvlan1 interface=ether1 mac-address=00:00:00:00:00:01
        ```
*   **Usage:**  Used for some specific network segmentation requirements, such as with VMs.

### 10.14 L3 Hardware Offloading

*   L3 hardware offloading can increase the throughput of your router by using the switch chip for routing operations instead of the CPU.
    *   Enable hardware offloading on a specific interface:
    ```routeros
        /interface ethernet set ether1 l3-hw-offloading=yes
    ```

### 10.15 MACsec

*   MACsec provides point-to-point encryption over ethernet links. It has specific hardware requirements.
*   Enable macsec on an interface:
    ```routeros
    /interface ethernet mac-sec add interface=ether1 key=secretkey
    ```
* **Usage:** Secure point to point ethernet links.

### 10.16 Quality of Service

*   MikroTik QoS uses Queues to prioritize traffic.
    *   Add a queue tree:
        ```routeros
         /queue tree add name=parent-queue max-limit=10M parent=global
        ```
    * Add a queue
        ```routeros
       /queue simple add name=high-priority target=192.168.1.0/24 max-limit=5M
      ```
    *  Add a queue with burst.
        ```routeros
         /queue simple add name=high-priority target=192.168.1.0/24 max-limit=5M burst-limit=8M burst-threshold=2M burst-time=10s
         ```
*   **Usage:** Prioritize specific applications for smoother performance (e.g., VoIP, video).
*   **Trade-offs:** Overly complex queues can be hard to manage and may result in unintended consequences, so it's important to understand the behavior of your traffic before implementing QoS.

### 10.17 Switch Chip Features

*   Some MikroTik routers have built-in switch chips that provide Layer 2 features.
    *   Add vlans via the switch chip.
        ```routeros
        /interface ethernet switch vlan add switch=switch1 vlan-id=89 ports=ether1,ether2
        ```
  *  Set the master port for a group of interfaces:
        ```routeros
        /interface ethernet switch port set ether2 master-port=ether1
        ```
*   **Usage:** Improve the performance of
