My router has a total of three ISP exits. I tried using ISP1 and ISP2 as ECMP routing tables and allowed some devices within the local network to use this ECMP routing table outgoing gateway. The other devices use the default main outgoing gateway.However, the problem is that after I set everything up, this specific device(10.0.0.130) did not follow the expected ECMP routing table and instead accessed the internet through the default gateway(pppoe-out8).I checked many times, but still couldn't find out where the problem was, and the mikrotik help documents also did not have any relevant guidance.I hope that experts within the community can help me out. Below is my configuration.Code:Select all@MikroTik]>export# 2024-12-07 21:13:40 by RouterOS 7.16.2# software id = xxxxxxxxx## model = CCR1036-12G-4S# serial number = xxxxxxxxxx/interfaceethernetset[finddefault-name=ether1]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether2]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether3]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether4]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether7]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether8]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether9]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=ether10]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=sfp3]disabled=yesset[finddefault-name=sfp4]disabled=yes/interfacepppoe-clientadddisabled=nointerface=sfp2 name=pppoe-out8 user=<pppoe-username>/interfacemacvlanaddinterface=ether5 mac-address=B2:54:05:89:BA:8Bmode=privatename=macvlan1addinterface=ether5 mac-address=F6:4F:AA:AD:82:B6 mode=privatename=macvlan2addinterface=ether6 mac-address=42:DB:28:D3:57:FB mode=privatename=macvlan3addinterface=ether6 mac-address=DE:E8:E3:5F:A8:00mode=privatename=macvlan4/interfacebondingaddmode=802.3adname=bonding1 slaves=ether11,ether12/interfacepppoe-clientadddisabled=nointerface=macvlan1 name=pppoe-out1 user=<pppoe-username>adddisabled=nointerface=macvlan2 name=pppoe-out2 user=<pppoe-username>/interfacelistaddname=WANaddname=LANaddname=LB/ip pooladdname=dhcp ranges=10.0.0.150-10.0.0.240/ip dhcp-serveraddaddress-pool=dhcpinterface=bonding1 name=dhcp1/routing tableadddisabled=nofib name=ecmpadddisabled=nofib name=CMIP_route/ip settingssetipv4-multipath-hash-policy=l4/interfacelist memberaddinterface=sfp1 list=WANaddinterface=pppoe-out8 list=WANaddinterface=pppoe-out1 list=LBaddinterface=pppoe-out2 list=LBaddinterface=bonding1 list=LAN/ip addressaddaddress=10.0.0.1/24comment=defconfinterface=bonding1 network=10.0.0.0/ip dhcp-server networkaddaddress=10.0.0.0/24dns-server=119.29.29.29,223.5.5.5gateway=10.0.0.1netmask=24/ip dnssetservers=119.29.29.29,119.28.28.28,2402:4e00::,2402:4e00:1::/ip firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=input comment="accept established,related,untracked"connection-state=\

Your configuration export doesn't show any reason why 10.0.0.130 should use routing tablemain, however, as of current (7.16.x), there are issues with handling of themin-prefixvalue in configuration. So unless you have added the first routing rule already with that value specified, add the same rule before (above) it using command line and then remove the existing one:Code:Select all/ip route rule{:localmyRule[findwheretable=ecmp]addcopy-from=$myRule place-before=$myRuleremove$myRule}and do notmodifythe routing rules later - if you need to change something in a routing rule,adda new one before the one that needs change, and then remove the old one.Your second routing rule makes little sense to me as it says "drop the packet from 10.0.0.130 to 10.0.0.100 if the only route to 10.0.0.100 in routing tablemainis the default one", whereas a) there is a route with dst-address=10.0.0.0/24 and b) a packet from 10.0.0.130 to 10.0.0.100 is bridged, not routed, unless you have done some voodoo on the device that has 10.0.0.130 itself. What was the idea behind this rule?

1. Your pool isadd name=dhcp ranges=10.0.0.150-10.0.0.240Why is any device getting a LANIP of .130 ????2.   Routes look messed u ( or maybe I dont understand how to apply ecmp )Should be...... at least for Version 7.Assumes ecmp is the primary and a few need to go out pppoe8  ( Edit, now I realize thats backwards see next block of code )/ip routeadd   distance=1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out1 routing-table=mainadd  distance=1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out2 routing-table=mainadd distance=10 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out8 routing-table=mainadd dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out8 routing-table=ecmpThus, lets reflect your needs./ip routeadd  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out8 routing-table=main  comment="Primary WAN3"add  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out1 routing-table=ecmpadd  dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out2 routing-table=ecmpBetter with recursive checking of connectivity/ip routeadd dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out8   routing-table=main comment="Primary WAN3"add  check-gateway=ping dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=1.1.1.1  routing-table=ecmp  scope=10 target-scope=12 comment=ISP1add  check-gateway=ping dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=9.9.9.9  routing-table=ecmp  scope=10 target-scope=12 comment=ISP2add dst-address=1.1.1.1/32 gateway=pppoe-out1 routing-table=ecmp scope=10 target-scope=11add dst-address=9.9.9.9/32 gateway=pppoe-out2 routing-table=ecmp scope=10 target-scope=113. This is aSECURITY PROBLEM,never allow access to winbox from the www.  ONLY from internal users, be they on LAN or after coming in on VPN.add action=accept chain=input comment="allow Winbox" disabled=yes in-interface-list=WAN port=8291 protocol=tcpEdit: I see its disabled.  ( same same for ssh )4.  Your input chain is still not safe due to  using block vice allow and block all else.For example  having this rule is weak!!add action=drop chain=input comment="block everything else" disabled=yes in-interface-list=WANThe fact that this is disabled is also very alarming!!!This is betteradd action=accept chain=input comment="allow LAN users only"  in-interface-list=LANadd action=drop chain=input comment="drop all else"Now you tell me the difference between  your rule and these two....?????????Notice you fail to block incoming traffic on WAN3, as your wan interface only describes WAN1 and WAN2.Its ALWAYS BETTER, to allow needed traffic and block everything else, than to think you  know all the traffic that must be blocked and allow everything else..................5.  WHY do you not have any forward chain rules?????????????6.   Finally, WHY DO you  not explain what the heck you are doing with the single IP address at the beginning??You mention a few addresses to use the ECMP but then DO NOT identify any such users, either by firewall address list OR mangling.So with a single subnet how do you propose to identify a bunch of users to use ECMP??There is some missing information and config here????7. As far as routing rules go.............   okay to use for a small number of users......  this should be what you have..add action=lookup-only-in-table src-address=10.0.0.130 table=ecmp

Wow... it did not come to my mind to look that low into your config.Bothpppoe-out1andpppoe-out2are attached tomacvlaninterfaces, which in turn are attached toether5, andether5is disabled (at least in the export you have posted). Disablingether5means that all traffic, not only IP one, that would physically pass through it, is down. Sopppoe-out1andpppoe-out2are down too, and due to that, also the routes through them become inactive.And now the difference betweenaction=lookupandaction=lookup-only-in-tablein the routing rules comes into play: if noactiveroute whatsoever is available for the destination address of the packet in the routing table the rule chooses, withlookup, the packet is routed using routing tablemain; withlookup-only-in-table, the packet is dropped.

I'm not sure purpose behind using the intermediate macvlan in the first place...Also, you cannot just add a route to routing table unless same route exists in the main routing table, which may be first order problem in OP's approach.

I'm not sure purpose behind using the intermediate macvlan in the first place...It may be necessary to use a different MAC address for each PPPoE client connecting to the same ISP using the same physical interface, and macvlan is one of few ways to ensure this. I haven't tested yet, though, whether it actually works.you cannot just add a route to routing table unless same route exists in the main routing tableCan you elaborate on why should doing so be a problem?

Re macvlan, it might be useful in some cases...  but adds more complexity if it's not actually needed was my point.you cannot just add a route to routing table unless same route exists in the main routing tableCan you elaborate on why should doing so be a problem?The docs onPolicy Routinghave one of the callouts that say that:For a user-created table to be able to resolve the destination, the main routing table should be able to resolve the destination too.and in my experience that's accurate...

the main routing table should be able to resolve the destination too.Yup, but a default route inmainis sufficient to meet this requirement.

Your configuration export doesn't show any reason why 10.0.0.130 should use routing table main, however, as of current (7.16.x), there are issues with handling of the min-prefix value in configuration.Actually, my intention is only to let the device with IP 10.0.0.130 use the ecmp outgoing, while other devices use the default route.and do not modify the routing rules later - if you need to change something in a routing rule, add a new one before the one that needs change, and then remove the old one.I am not yet familiar with RouterOS scripts, and I tried running the code you provided in the terminal, but it failed. In the end, I manually added new routing rules and deleted the old ones.But it still cannot be routed correctly.1. Your pool isadd name=dhcp ranges=10.0.0.150-10.0.0.240Why is any device getting a LANIP of .130 ????Please check the beginning of this reply, and the IP address of the .130 device is manually set by me, not through DHCP.Thus, lets reflect your needs./ip routeadd dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out8 routing-table=main comment="Primary WAN3"add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out1 routing-table=ecmpadd dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out2 routing-table=ecmpI have already done that.SECURITY PROBLEMAt that time, I completed the configuration by referring to this linkhttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... figuration, but I haven't confirmed the purpose of each item in detail. Since it is still in the development stage, it is not important for the time being. And I also clearly know that winbox cannot be exposed to the internet. If there are better security-related configurations, please provide them.ot have any forward chain rulesWill this cause my ecmp to not be able to take on traffic, for now I have all filter rules disabled to avoid problems due to filters. I will set it up again when my routing rules stabilize.6. Finally, WHY DO you not explain what the heck you are doing with the single IP address at the beginning??In the production environment, I may only have one to two devices that need to use the ecmp outgoing, and in my configuration, only one device is set to use the ecmp, which is .130.Both pppoe-out1 and pppoe-out2 are attached to macvlan interfacesYou are right, because I need to dial the same interface twice. And I might increase it to four dials, respectively on ether5 and ether6. And each dial cannot have the same MAC address. In the past, I would use vrrp, but later I learned about macvlan.For a user-created table to be able to resolve the destination, the main routing table should be able to resolve the destination too.I don't quite understand this sentence. I'll try to explain, meaning that if I create a command like`add disabled=yes distance=1 dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=pppoe-out1 routing-table=ecmp`, do I have to create another one in the main routing table at the same time?

No worries, if  macvlan works and is appropriate for your ISP setup.Fix the the routing rule and see what happens.Post config again after changes.Note the only change on routes is I added recursive but not necessary.also no need to make main route have distance anything but the default of 1.

Both pppoe-out1 and pppoe-out2 are attached to macvlan interfacesYou are right, because I need to dial the same interface twice.That's OK, I've even tested that if the pppoe interface is attached to a macvlan, the pppoe-discover frames are indeed sent via the physical interface with the source MAC address of the macvlan one, so all good here. But I have missed that ether5 was in factnotdisabled, so the whole conclusion was based on wrong input.So to start from somewhere, are the two routes in tableecmpshown as active?

I'm not sure if it's affected by other configurations, but for policy routing, I only have the one strategy that we have discussed so far.This remark makes me cautious, but I assume you haven't removed any mangle rules from the export before posting it? I cannot imagine anything else to have an impact.And I would like to ask if there is any way to observe if a routing rule has been hit or not.For the firewall I can turn on logging to debug, but I can't see the routing rules.Unfortunately, there isn't, neither logging nor packet&byte counters work for routes and routing rules. But that brings me to a question, how do you determine which path the packets from 10.0.0.130 actually take? By checking the public address using myip.wtf or a similar site, by sniffing traffic on the pppoe-out1 and pppoe-out2 interfaces, in some other way?

So you did filter out some of the configuration previously, but it was indeed unrelated, OK.First I would change theactionin the only routing rule fromlookuptolookup-only-in-tableand remove themin-prefixcompletely (but usingremoveandadd, for the reason explained before). If that changes nothing about the behavior, it means that the routing rule is ignored; if you stop getting any response, it means the rules are respected but the routing using tableecmpfails.If the routing rule is actually ignored, I'd remove it and try to use a mangle rule instead to achieve the same effect. Since ROS 7.6 or so, routing marks assigned by mangle rules have precedence over those assigned by routing rules, so removing the routing rule should be just an additional protection if they do act but in an unexpected way.

I tested again with a restored factory configured ax3 router and when I tried to configure one of the following two rules, neither could hit the ecmp routing table and all traffic went through the main table.Code:Select all/routing ruleaddaction=lookup min-prefix=0src-address=192.168.88.0/24table=ecmp/routing ruleaddaction=lookup min-prefix=0src-address=192.168.88.252table=ecmpThe full configuration is in the following:Code:Select all# 2024-12-08 17:36:30 by RouterOS 7.16.1# software id = xxxxxx## model = C53UiG+5HPaxD2HPaxD# serial number = xxxxxx/disksetusb1 media-interface=none media-sharing=no/interfacebridgeaddadmin-mac=D4:01:C3:44:04:3Fauto-mac=nocomment=defconf name=bridge/interfacewifiset[finddefault-name=wifi1]channel.skip-dfs-channels=10min-cac \

First I would change the action in the only routing rule from lookup to lookup-only-in-table and remove the min-prefix completelyAs you said on ax3, when I deleted all the routing rules and did not usemin-prefix, ecmp took effect immediately, but it also prevented me from logging into winbox again.Because I usedsrc-address=192.168.88.0/24But why does ecmp not work when I use mini-prefix, and I cannot access the 192.168.88.0/24 subnet, even the gateway times out, when I do not use mini-prefix.Next, I will test it on ccr1036.Edit: I think the ecmp has been work.

I'd remove it and try to use a mangle rule instead to achieve the same effect.I have a question, now it seems that ecmp is already working.When I use routing rules for routing, will it be more CPU resource-saving than using mangle? Because when I used mangle with pcc before, if the PT client was downloading, the speed would not reach full capacity, and it seems that the firewall is only using one CPU core to process the mangle rules. And I also saw an option in/routing/settingwhether to enable single process.

So it was a configuration after all. Whatmin-prefixactually does is that it takes a look which route in the indicated table would be used for the packet, and if the length of thedst-addressprefix of that route is smaller than or equal to themin-prefixvalue, the rule returns a non-match so the packet processing commences to the next rule. So you have used it in a reverse way, it should have said instead:/routing/ruleadd min-prefix=0 action=lookup table=mainadd src-address=10.0.0.130 action=lookup-only-in-table table=ecmpTry this pair of routing rules instead of the mangle rule, please.

For anyone later that follows this thread;;;;;;;In this case since there is only one subnet and the prefix rule is basically doing the equivalent  to:/routiing  ruleadd action=lookup-only-in-table src-address=192.168.88.0/24 dst-address=192.168.88.0/24  table=mainThe value in  using the min-prefix=0 is that it allows any local subnet to subnet traffic to occur ( from or to source address )++++++++++Without any variation of the above rules, such traffic originating from source or responding from source goes out the next "force traffic to somewhere" routing rule.So the variation is required prior to the force rule.

Sorry @anav, but your wording is so advanced that it is confusing even for me, although I know what you actually intended to say.So let me try myself in a simpler language with more details: In most cases, we need to prevent the traffic towards local destinations from using other routing table thanmain. Until recently, the only way to do that using routing rules alone was to put (one or several) rules withdst-addressmatching the local subnets withaction=lookup table=mainbefore (above) the rule that matched onsrc-addressand/orinterfaceandaction=lookup-only-in-tabletable=something-else-than-main. So traffic towards local destinations never reached the rule telling it to use another routing table.The value of themin-prefixattribute is that it allows to use just a single rule for the same purpose, which is universal in terms that you do not need to specify thedst-addressto match to manually; instead, it uses thedst-addressof the existing routes in the routing table, taking their prefix length (a.k.a. subnet mask) into account.As an example, let routing tablemaincontain one default route provided by a DHCP client and three routes to "connected subnets":dst-address, gateway, distance0.0.0.0/0, 10.0.0.1, 1192.168.88.0/24, bridge1, 0192.168.44.0/24, bridge2, 010.11.0.0/22,bridge3, 0To make sure that traffic towards any of these three local subnets will be routed using tablemain, we need three rules:dst-address=192.168.88.0/24 action=lookup table=maindst-address=192.168.44.0/24 action=lookup table=maindst-address=10.11.0.0/22 action=lookup table=mainIf it is OK to usemainfor all private destinations, this can be reduced to just two rules:dst-address=192.168.0.0/16 action=lookup table=maindst-address=10.0.0.0/8 action=lookup table=mainBut withmin-prefix, a single rule is sufficient:min-prefix=0 action=lookup table=mainIt will look into tablemain, find the best matching route for the packet being processed, and if the prefix length (subnet mask) of thedst-addressof that route is higher than themin-prefixvalue, it will tell the routing to use that routing table for the packet; otherwise, it will hand the packet over to the next routing rule as if it did not match it.

Why do all people have to plus one to target-scope when using recursive routing?Finally I have a requirement that I don't know if I can implement, currently my configuration failover will transfer all traffic to pppoe-out1 but I would like to transfer it directly to ECMP's load balancing instead of taking over all traffic through pppoe-out1 alone, after pppoe-out8 fails.Another ROS issue I don't understand is why the two things/routing/rulesand/ip/routewere separated after the 7.x release.

Slow down, manLeaving aside that the topic title has become totally misleading already long ago, and that you have changed the objective all of a sudden, your bold rules are either incomplete or incorrect.The whole idea of using the recursive next-hop search to monitor route transparency is to prevent the router from sending traffic via faulty routes. So if the goal is to use the route viapppoe-out8as long as it works, and if that one has a problem, to evenly distribute the traffic among all the functional pppoe-out1 to pppoe-out4 routes using ECMP, you must monitor all those routes individually. So the overall setup would bedst-address=ca.na.ry.1/32 gateway=pppoe-out1dst-address=ca.na.ry.2/32 gateway=pppoe-out2dst-address=ca.na.ry.3/32 gateway=pppoe-out3dst-address=ca.na.ry.4/32 gateway=pppoe-out4dst-address=ca.na.ry.8/32 gateway=pppoe-out8dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.8 distance=1check-gateway=ping target-scope=11dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.1 distance=2check-gateway=ping target-scope=11dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.2 distance=2check-gateway=ping target-scope=11dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.3 distance=2check-gateway=ping target-scope=11dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.4 distance=2check-gateway=ping target-scope=11ca.na.ry.Xmust be a unique address for each WAN.

Also its nice to tells us different requirements,   but if you dont post the most update config, we have no idea where things are at.Thus everytime you make changes post the new config/export file=anynameyouwish   ( minus router serial number, any public WANIP information, keys etc..)Also state all the requirements (the whole plan) as opposed  to bits and pieces.

@Amm0,Yup, but a default route inmainis sufficient to meet this requirement.Also, I'm pretty sure that statement in the documentation is a simplification the author has used to avoid the need to explain that this requirement (for some route to exist inmain) is only related to own outgoing traffic of the router, which indeed has to be routed using tablemainfirst, in order to ever get to mangle and eventually hit a rule there that tells it to run through routing again, using some other routing table this time.

Now I do want to say I got invalid routes in some past V7 RouterOS versions with the rule was violated...My usual setup is failover in main (distance=1...x, with some combo of 0-2x "ethernet" WAN + 1-2x LTE links), using routing table per WAN plus an "ecmp" route table as here.  So it doesn't come up in practice, since all WANs are in main routing table.  Also LTE is an interface route, that might affect the logic too, IDK.   I'll run a test since you have me curious on exactly what works here.

Interesting,  ECMP sure is much less complex in terms of sharing the load in case one of the WANs is not available.In load balancing, it can turn into a huge nightmare of extra mangles and routes.I am not convinced your recursive is correct I would do it this way.dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.8 distance=1 check-gateway=ping  scope=10  target-scope=12   comment=WAN08dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.1 distance=2 check-gateway=ping  scope=10  target-scope=12dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.2 distance=2 check-gateway=ping  scope=10  target-scope=12dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.3 distance=2 check-gateway=ping  scope=10  target-scope=12dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=ca.na.ry.4 distance=2 check-gateway=ping  scope=10  target-scope=12++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++dst-address=ca.na.ry.8/32 gateway=pppoe-out8   distance=1  scope=10  target-scope=11dst-address=ca.na.ry.1/32 gateway=pppoe-out1   distance=2  scope=10  target-scope=11dst-address=ca.na.ry.2/32 gateway=pppoe-out2   distance=2  scope=10  target-scope=11dst-address=ca.na.ry.3/32 gateway=pppoe-out3   distance=2  scope=10  target-scope=11dst-address=ca.na.ry.4/32 gateway=pppoe-out4   distance=2  scope=10  target-scope=11I do appreciate the detail in   ca.na.ry.x  though.
