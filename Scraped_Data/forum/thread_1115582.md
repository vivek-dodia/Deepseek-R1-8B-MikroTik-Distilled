I have an interface (just a simple interface, not part of a bridge) and I would like to throw away incoming packets from a specific MAC address, can I do that on a RB960PGS (hEX PoE)?

On that particular device model, the followingshouldwork but you have to try:/interface ethernet switch ruleadd ports=ether5 src-mac-address=10:20:30:40:50:60/FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF switch=switch1 new-dst-ports=""On devices without switch chip rules support, you would have to create a dedicated bridge whose only port would be the interface in question.
