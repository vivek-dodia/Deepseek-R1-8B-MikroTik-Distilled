Okay, let's dive into a deep exploration of IP Routing on MikroTik RouterOS 7.11 (and earlier 6.48) within the context of a Hotspot Network, using the example subnet 98.167.118.0/24 on the interface `wlan-2`. We'll aim for an "Expert" level, covering a wide array of MikroTik features.

## **1. Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:** We are building a hotspot network in a small business (SOHO/SMB), where `wlan-2` is the wireless interface dedicated to clients connecting to the hotspot. We'll configure basic IP routing on `wlan-2`, ensuring clients can reach the internet and potentially local resources.  This is a core component. We'll gradually build up, exploring related services and capabilities.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

1.  **Interface Configuration:** `wlan-2` will need an IP address in the 98.167.118.0/24 range.
2.  **IP Routing:** Enable IP forwarding for clients on `wlan-2` to access other networks.
3.  **DHCP Server:**  A DHCP server will dynamically assign IPs to clients.
4.  **NAT (Network Address Translation):** To enable internet access for hotspot clients.
5.  **Basic Firewalling:** A base level of firewall security to prevent unauthorized access.
6.  **DNS Services:** Ensure clients can resolve domain names.

## **2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

Here's how we implement this scenario, step-by-step using both CLI and Winbox explanations:

### Step 1: Interface Configuration (CLI & Winbox)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/interface wireless
set wlan2 mode=ap-bridge ssid="Hotspot-WiFi" band=2ghz-b/g/n channel-width=20/40mhz-Ce frequency=2437 security-profile=default
/ip address
add address=98.167.118.1/24 interface=wlan2
```

**Explanation:**

*   `/interface wireless`: This takes us to the wireless configuration context.
    *   `set wlan2 mode=ap-bridge ...`: Configures the `wlan2` interface to act as an Access Point (AP).
        *   `mode=ap-bridge`: Sets the mode to access point (bridging is standard, allows multiple clients).
        *   `ssid="Hotspot-WiFi"`: Sets the WiFi name.
        *   `band=2ghz-b/g/n`: Sets supported bands.
        *   `channel-width=20/40mhz-Ce`: Channel width selection.
        *    `frequency=2437`: The central frequency (2.4 GHz channel 6)
        *   `security-profile=default`: Assumes basic WPA2 security. You'll need to configure this properly via `/interface wireless security-profiles`
*   `/ip address`: This takes us to IP address configurations.
    *   `add address=98.167.118.1/24 interface=wlan2`: Assigns the IP 98.167.118.1/24 to interface `wlan2` (Our router's IP on this subnet).

**Winbox (Equivalent Steps):**
    * Go to *Wireless* menu.
    * Double click wlan2, configure parameters similar to CLI.
    * Go to *IP > Addresses*, click the "+" button and configure an IP address.

### Step 2: IP Pool Creation (CLI & Winbox)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=hotspot-pool ranges=98.167.118.2-98.167.118.254
```

**Explanation:**

*   `/ip pool`: Enters the IP Pool configuration.
    *   `add name=hotspot-pool ranges=98.167.118.2-98.167.118.254`: Creates a pool named `hotspot-pool` which will be used to lease IPs.

**Winbox (Equivalent Steps):**
    * Go to *IP > Pool*, click the "+" button and configure IP pool.

### Step 3: DHCP Server Configuration (CLI & Winbox)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=hotspot-pool disabled=no interface=wlan2 lease-time=10m name=hotspot-dhcp
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=98.167.118.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=98.167.118.1
```

**Explanation:**

*   `/ip dhcp-server`: Enters DHCP server configurations.
    *   `add address-pool=hotspot-pool disabled=no interface=wlan2 lease-time=10m name=hotspot-dhcp`: Creates a DHCP server instance for `wlan2`.
        *   `address-pool=hotspot-pool`: Uses the `hotspot-pool` we created.
        *   `disabled=no`: Enables the DHCP server.
        *   `interface=wlan2`: Binds to the `wlan2` interface.
        *   `lease-time=10m`: Sets the lease time to 10 minutes.
        * `name=hotspot-dhcp`: Sets a name for this server.
*   `/ip dhcp-server network`: Configure the DHCP network parameters.
    *   `add address=98.167.118.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=98.167.118.1`: Defines the DHCP network details for the 98.167.118.0/24 network.
        *   `address=98.167.118.0/24`: Defines the network itself.
        *   `dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Provides the Google DNS servers for clients.
        *   `gateway=98.167.118.1`: Specifies the router's IP on the local network as the gateway.

**Winbox (Equivalent Steps):**
    * Go to *IP > DHCP Server*, click the "+" button, and configure as in the CLI example.
    * Go to *IP > DHCP Server > Networks* and add the network settings.

### Step 4: NAT Configuration (CLI & Winbox)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1
```

**Explanation:**
* `/ip firewall nat`: Enter the NAT (Network Address Translation) configuration.
* `add chain=srcnat action=masquerade out-interface=ether1`:  Creates a NAT rule.
    *  `chain=srcnat`: Defines the NAT chain to modify source IPs.
    *  `action=masquerade`:  Use masquerading (Dynamic NAT) - Uses the routers primary IP when leaving through interface ether1.
    * `out-interface=ether1`: Specifies the interface that will be used as the external interface (where clients will reach the internet).  Change ether1 to your actual internet facing interface.

**Winbox (Equivalent Steps):**
    * Go to *IP > Firewall > NAT*, click the "+" button, and configure the rule.

### Step 5: IP Forwarding & Basic Firewall Rules (CLI & Winbox)

**CLI:**

```mikrotik
/ip settings
set ip-forward=yes
/ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept
add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept
add chain=input in-interface=wlan2 action=drop
add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept
add chain=forward src-address=98.167.118.0/24 action=accept
add chain=forward action=drop
```

**Explanation:**

*   `/ip settings set ip-forward=yes`: Enables IP forwarding for the router to route packets. This must be enabled for the router to send packets between interfaces.

*   `/ip firewall filter`: Enters the firewall filter configurations.

    *   `add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept`: Allows established and related connections to pass on the input chain.  This is important for existing sessions.
    *   `add chain=input protocol=icmp action=accept`: Allows ICMP requests (pings) on the input chain. Useful for basic debugging.
    *    `add chain=input in-interface=wlan2 action=drop`: Blocks direct access to the router from the `wlan2` interface. Important for security.
    *   `add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept`: Allows established and related connections to pass on the forward chain (packets traversing the router).
    *   `add chain=forward src-address=98.167.118.0/24 action=accept`: Allows traffic from the hotspot network to pass through.
    *   `add chain=forward action=drop`: Drops any other traffic that did not match above.

**Winbox (Equivalent Steps):**
    * Go to *IP > Settings*, enable "ip-forward"
    * Go to *IP > Firewall > Filter Rules*, add filter rules similar to the CLI above.

### **3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

Below is the consolidated CLI configuration:

```mikrotik
/interface wireless
set wlan2 mode=ap-bridge ssid="Hotspot-WiFi" band=2ghz-b/g/n channel-width=20/40mhz-Ce frequency=2437 security-profile=default
/ip address
add address=98.167.118.1/24 interface=wlan2
/ip pool
add name=hotspot-pool ranges=98.167.118.2-98.167.118.254
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=hotspot-pool disabled=no interface=wlan2 lease-time=10m name=hotspot-dhcp
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=98.167.118.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=98.167.118.1
/ip firewall nat

add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept
add chain=forward src-address=98.167.118.0/24 action=accept
add chain=forward action=drop
```

### **4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfalls:**
    *   **Incorrect Interface:** Wrong interface name in any command will cause the configuration to be ineffective.
    *   **NAT Misconfiguration:** Incorrect `out-interface` in the NAT rule can prevent clients from reaching the internet.
    *   **Firewall Ordering:** Firewall rules are processed from top to bottom.  A poorly ordered rule may block traffic that should otherwise be allowed.
    *   **IP Address Overlap:** Overlapping IP subnets can cause routing conflicts.
    *   **DHCP Server Conflict:** If multiple DHCP servers exist on the network, it can cause issues for IP assignment.

*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Connectivity Issues:** Use `ping` and `traceroute` from both the router and client to trace connection issues.
    *   **DHCP Errors:** Check `/ip dhcp-server lease` to see if clients are getting IPs. Look at the DHCP server logs (`/system logging`) for errors.
    *   **NAT Issues:** Ensure the `out-interface` of the NAT rule is correct. Verify that IP Forwarding is enabled and the NAT rule has a proper action.
    *   **Firewall Blocking:** Use the firewall log (`/system logging`) to check what is being blocked. Enable logging on suspect rules and examine the output.

*   **Diagnostics (Examples):**
    *   **Checking DHCP:** `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to view leases.
    *   **Checking IP Routes:** `/ip route print` to check the routing table.
    *   **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=wlan2` to see real-time traffic flow on the wlan2 interface.
    *   **Packet Sniffer:** `/tool packet-sniffer start file-name=capture` captures packets for later analysis.
        * To review:  `/tool packet-sniffer print` will show the capture, and you can then view it by downloading the file from /file.
    *  **Log:** `/system logging print` to check logs for errors.
        * Be sure to configure `/system logging action` for logging to memory/disk.
    * **Ping:** `ping 98.167.118.1` or `ping google.com` to check connectivity.

**Error Scenario:**

*   **Scenario:**  Clients get DHCP IPs, but no internet.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    1. Check if NAT rule out-interface is correct (e.g. `ether1` or whatever your internet interface is).
    2. Check the router's IP configuration on `ether1`, does it have internet access?
    3. Check `ip firewall filter` for blocking rules on the forward chain that impact the client.

### **5. Verification and Testing**

1.  **Client Connection:** Connect a device to the "Hotspot-WiFi" network.
2.  **IP Address Verification:** Verify that the device received an IP address in the 98.167.118.0/24 subnet.
3.  **Ping Router:** From the client, `ping 98.167.118.1`.
4.  **Ping Internet:** From the client, `ping 8.8.8.8` and `ping google.com` to check internet connectivity.
5.  **Traceroute:** From the client, `traceroute google.com` to see the route the packets are taking.
6.  **Router Tests:** Use the MikroTik tools `ping`, `traceroute` and `torch` to check from the router directly.
7.  **Winbox:**  Check *IP > DHCP Server > Leases* to verify clients have received an IP.

### **6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Addressing:**  RouterOS supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. You can configure both on the same interface if needed.
*   **IP Pools:**  IP Pools can be reused, or used for different services such as VPN and more.  You can combine them with RADIUS and similar for highly customized services.
*   **IP Routing:**  RouterOS supports static routing, dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP), and policy-based routing.
*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** This allows you to separate routing domains on the same router.  Useful for complex ISP networks.
*   **Policy Based Routing:** You can manipulate routing based on a wide array of criteria such as source address, destination address, ports and much more.
*   **Firewall:** The RouterOS firewall is extremely powerful, with support for multiple chains, connection tracking, and layer7 filtering.
*  **Queues:** You can implement highly customized traffic shaping and quality of service using the built-in tools.  This allows you to optimize traffic flows.
* **Connection Tracking:** RouterOS's connection tracking can determine the state of a network session. Useful in firewall rules and NAT configurations.
*  **Bridging:** RouterOS can act as a bridge, passing traffic at layer-2. Useful for creating network segments.
* **VLAN:** VLANs allow you to segment your network at the layer-2 level. This is used to provide logical separation within the same physical network.
*   **Limitations:**  While RouterOS is feature-rich, hardware limitations can impact performance. The CPU, RAM and switch chip on the router limit what it can handle.

**Less Common Feature Scenario: Policy-Based Routing**

Suppose we wanted some clients to go through a different gateway.

**CLI Configuration Example:**

```mikrotik
/ip route
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.88.1 routing-mark=hotspot-gateway1
add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.99.1
/ip firewall mangle
add chain=prerouting src-address=98.167.118.10-98.167.118.20 action=mark-routing new-routing-mark=hotspot-gateway1
```

**Explanation:**
* `/ip route`: Configure routing table
    * Add a default route (0.0.0.0/0) with the gateway 192.168.88.1 and mark this route as `hotspot-gateway1`
    * Add another default route (0.0.0.0/0) with a normal gateway (192.168.99.1)
* `/ip firewall mangle`: Configure the mangle table for packet marking.
    * Mangle any traffic that matches address range `98.167.118.10-98.167.118.20` on the prerouting chain, and apply the routing mark `hotspot-gateway1`

**Explanation:**  This would force the traffic from IPs 98.167.118.10-20 to use the route configured for hotspot-gateway1, going through a different gateway.

### **7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

### **8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing:** IP addresses are used to identify devices on a network. RouterOS uses both IPv4 and IPv6 and can even use both at the same time on an interface.
*   **IP Pools:**  IP pools are a defined range of IP addresses that can be assigned automatically. They are a fundamental building block of DHCP servers and other dynamic address assignment services.
*   **IP Routing:**  Routing is the process of determining the path a network packet takes to get to its destination.  In RouterOS, routing occurs both internally and externally and can be highly customized using policy based routing and VRF.
*   **Bridging:** Bridging is used to pass traffic at the layer-2 level.  This is useful for creating a single network segment that spans multiple interfaces.
* **Switching:**  The switch chip in RouterOS handles packet switching at layer-2.  This allows high-speed forwarding of traffic between different interfaces.
*   **Firewall:**  The firewall controls access to your network, based on rules that specify what traffic is allowed and blocked. RouterOS' firewall is stateful, keeping track of connections.
*   **Connection Tracking:** RouterOS tracks network connections, which allows it to determine if a packet belongs to an existing session. This enhances firewall security and NAT functionality.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):** NAT is used to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing many devices to share a single public IP address.

**Why specific commands are used:**
*   `/ip address add ...`: To configure the router's IP on a particular interface. This provides the base address for networking on that interface.
*   `/ip pool add ...`:  To create a pool of IPs the DHCP server can use to assign clients on the network.
*   `/ip dhcp-server add ...`: Creates a DHCP server that will listen on an interface and assign IP addresses to clients.
*   `/ip dhcp-server network add ...`: Configures the network details that will be sent to DHCP clients.
*   `/ip firewall nat add ...`: To enable NAT on the router, allowing traffic to traverse the internet when it is using private IP addresses.
*   `/ip firewall filter add ...`: Configures a filter rule, allowing or blocking traffic based on specific parameters.
*   `/ip settings set ip-forward=yes`:  This *must* be enabled to allow the router to forward packets from one interface to another.

### **9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Change Default Password:**  Never use the default admin password.
*   **Disable Default User:**  Disable the default admin user after creating a new admin user.
*   **Secure Winbox Access:** Limit access to Winbox to specific IP addresses or networks.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services that are not in use (e.g., API, Telnet, FTP).
*   **Use Strong Passwords:** Always use strong, complex passwords.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep the RouterOS version up to date for bug fixes and security patches.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Use firewall rules to restrict access to management ports (e.g., Winbox port 8291).
*   **HTTPS/TLS:** Use HTTPS for API access and secure other sensitive services with TLS where applicable.
*   **Input Chain Protection:** Always protect the input chain with restrictions to avoid direct access to router.
*   **Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logging to monitor activity and identify security breaches.
*   **MAC Address Filtering:** Use MAC address lists or profiles for wireless security (but remember MAC address spoofing is possible).

### **10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples for the Listed MikroTik Topics**

add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=vlan100
```

*   **Adding a simple queue to limit bandwidth for the wlan2 interface**
```mikrotik
/queue simple
add name="wlan2-limit" target=wlan2 max-limit=5M/5M
```

*   **Adding a static DNS entry:**
```mikrotik
/ip dns static
add address=192.168.100.2 name="server.local.com"
```

**Trade-offs:**

Each feature provides benefits and trade-offs.

*   **Bridging** can simplify network setup but reduce efficiency.
*   **Routing** provides more control but adds complexity.
*   **Firewalling** increases security but can impact performance.
*   **Queuing** improves QoS but requires careful planning.
*  **Hardware offloading** can increase speeds, but may limit the features you can use on a particular interface.

You must balance performance, features, and complexity based on your needs.

This extensive documentation and configuration examples provide a strong basis for understanding IP Routing and other core networking concepts on a MikroTik router within a Hotspot environment. It also covers key features and how you can use them. Remember to always test configurations carefully and understand the security implications of any changes made to your router.
