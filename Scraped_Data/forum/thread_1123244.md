We actually don't know what kind of "abuse by vendor" can come out of this device-mode can of worms. They can even force the override of user-defined settings of device-mode on every subsequent upgrade - if they want to get rid of more customers...The whole auto-enabled device mode is a misguided attempt to fight things like several past issues with poorly configured ROS devices turned into bot-nets and used for DOS attacks.While main reason for this to happen is a good part of MTs target market lacks skills, resources and sometimes attitude to properly configure internet exposed devices.Now some folks will avoid updating to >=7.17 because they understandably want to avoid risking to lock up remote devices in a way requiring someone to travel to the site. And maybe even climb up a pole. Leading to ROS devices running intentionally on outdated versions.And if someone figures out a pattern to trigger the obscure "flagged" mode, there will be an easy way to DOS Mikrotik devices.Device mode might have it's applications, but force-enabling it on remote SW updates for existing productions devices is a more than questionable idea.It's a classic example of "we need to do something so we do something allowing us to claim we did something".

Why is device-mode even being discussed in this 7.18beta topic? As far as I can see, there hasn’t been a single changelog item related to device-mode in 7.18. It would make more sense to discuss this in the 7.17 thread or in a dedicated topic.A separate, well-focused discussion with significant attention and engagement is likely to catch MikroTik’s attention more effectively than scattered comments within release threads. The discussions during the 7.17 beta were productive and positive, and the community feedback helped refine the most problematic aspects of the initial device-mode implementation.

I am still hoping for a solution where defconf for the firewall can be applied to an existing router...  some command that removes the firewall config and reloads it from defconf, if only as a commandline script.So far none of changes in firewall defconf was ever applied when upgrading ROS. So I don't see this one coming either.To be clear: I am NOT suggesting that defconf be applied when upgrading RouterOS.What I am suggesting is that there should be a command that the admin can issue and that resets the firewall settings to the defconf for the currently running version of RouterOS.Entirely by their own request.  Not automatic, and maybe after a confirmation similar to what you get when doing reset-configuration.Except it will reset only the firewall.

I feel like the default firewall keeps improving, so it be good to re-refresh just that.  Perhaps even on device without a default configuration to add a "standard" one - MANUALLY.Also help with branding/netinstall custom defconfs... sinceafirewall should be included, it actually be better to be able to do some "/ip/firewall/reset-to-default", instead of adding the default by copy-and-paste to custom defconf.

Ooow, wait...hummm dammit"Frequently the issues ar in the iBGP keeping NLRI and recursive next-hop.I didn't have the strength to do this test 7.18beta2 so far.I have a virtual Lab running on 7.17, during this week I'm intended to upgrade to test it.

..[cut]..The suggestion I am making may seem very disruptive, but it is actually a development trend and not an innovation.Basically, the idea is that all RouteOS features expose the possibility of sending the events of these features to a hook manager.And from this hook manager, scripts can be invoked so that the user can do what he needs to do...[cut]..I love it! I hope MT guys do the same ;)

anyone has successfully experience implement MPLS-VPN6 (6vpe) on v7?is it works?thxIt worked for me over IPv6 till 7.16.x.In 7.17 and 7.18 there is a bug, which destroys almost all of the IPv4 RIB, DHCP default route is disappearing, so I disabled VPNv6 everywhere because it made almost all of our remote CPEs unreachable. I built a test setup for MT support and waiting them to investigate.

When I digged into it deeper some months ago, IIRC mrz from MT said on this forum that, its because of lack of support of "IPv6 route over IPv4 nexthop". Only "IPv4 route over IPv6 nextop" is supported in kernel, which they selected for RoS7. Similar issue is exists in FFRouting but there the nexthop encoding is incorrect:https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/4661That should be seen, IPv6 route over IPv4, what is cisco and others do, is a hack, a necessary evil.Fortunately we have IOS-XR boxes which is the only cisco OS that supports VPNv6 over IPv6 and it can forward VPNv6 traffic between IPv6 MT CPEs and VPNv6 over IPv4 backbone. Now the ball is on MT's side to fix the issues around VPNv6.

First of all, amazing release! L3HW and IPv6 FastTrack were much needed and worked well on my RB5009, achieving 4Gb WAN speed.However, I have a strange issue. Has anyone else experienced new ND issues? Apple devices randomly lose IPv6 connectivity, and LAN devices receive adversed IPv6 addresses from all VLANs. Everything was fine until the latest 7.17 update and broke in 7.18-beta

The "LAN devices receive adversed IPv6 addresses from all VLANs" is that referring to Windows devices that are on ports with tagged VLANs present?As that is a Windows bug, has nothing to do with RouterOS.

BTW, when you listed default config, your terminal windows wasn't wide enough, some rules were clipped on the right side (the above written one as well).Well, an irritating problem in printing default-configuration is that it does not wrap the lines and the lines are very long.So you need to print with arg file=outputfile and then download the outputfile.txt to have a complete default-configuration.Even then I first thought that the fasttrack rule for ipv6 was already there, but it seems it is not, that still has to happen.But it is there for ip (v4) so that can be used as a guide.

I encountered an issue while testing VPNv6 in a CE-PE scenario.Issue Details:I configured fc00:101::1/126 on ether1 (PE router), which belongs to vrf-CE1.After adding this IPv6 prefix, /ipv6/route/ hangs, and the connected route for fc00:101::/126 does not appear in /ipv6/route/ under vrf-CE1 table.The CE router is unable to ping fc00:101::1.Running the export command results in the error:Code:Select all#errorexporting'/ipv6/route'(timeout)CPU usage spikes significantly.All router IDs under /routing/id become invalid.Workaround:Changing the prefix length from /126 to /64 resolves the issue.It appears that MikroTik RouterOS struggles with certain IPv6 subnet sizes in a VRF environment. Could you confirm if this is a known issue, and if there's any fix or workaround available?Thank you.

E.g under "dhcp info" there may be a "dhcp de-assigned IP for MAC" and a "dhcp assigned IP for MAC" and these two would have a different ID.  But all the "dhcp de-assigned IP for MAC" (for different IP and MAC, at different times) would have the same ID.About multiple messages: there are cases where messages are needlessly split into many multiples.  It mainly happens with debug messages.  E.g. enabling "ipsec" messages results in a seamlessly endless output of messages each with a single variable or parameter.  That makes it difficult to use, especially because the relation to something like a peer IP address is completely lost.More of the small parts should be put in a single message that starts with a meaningful heading that includes session identifying information like a peer IP.

Changing the prefix length from /126 to /64 resolves the issue.It appears that MikroTik RouterOS struggles with certain IPv6 subnet sizes in a VRF environment. Could you confirm if this is a known issue, and if there's any fix or workaround available?Did you reproduce this issue on a hardware-based scenario (device with switchchip) or on a virtual machine?The reason for the question is because that characteristic looks like some very old issues on some experienced hardware-based vendors related to binary threes, longest prefix match, and TCAM limited resources.On docs of HW offload of MikroTik I remember something like "more specific are preferred to go to off-load".A possibility issue could be that:- IPv6 smaller than /64 route + Route Target marker fits on tuple limit of TCAM on switch chip.- but IPv6 longer than /64 when added the Route Target marker exceeds the tuple limit.If this is in a software-based scenario... This probably doesn't apply.P.S.: When I was writing this, I felt in 2008 and dealing IPv6 firmware upgrades of some Cisco routers.

Also, I wish RouterOS would return to <= v7.17 behavior when files in container store were hidden.Would a type of permission per user-group like:"allow-to-read-files-inside-containers=[yes|no]"not be enough to solve your need?Note: This is just a suggested alternative in case hiding the internal files again is impossible.

Changing the prefix length from /126 to /64 resolves the issue.It appears that MikroTik RouterOS struggles with certain IPv6 subnet sizes in a VRF environment. Could you confirm if this is a known issue, and if there's any fix or workaround available?Did you reproduce this issue on a hardware-based scenario (device with switchchip) or on a virtual machine?The reason for the question is because that characteristic looks like some very old issues on some experienced hardware-based vendors related to binary threes, longest prefix match, and TCAM limited resources.On docs of HW offload of MikroTik I remember something like "more specific are preferred to go to off-load".A possibility issue could be that:- IPv6 smaller than /64 route + Route Target marker fits on tuple limit of TCAM on switch chip.- but IPv6 longer than /64 when added the Route Target marker exceeds the tuple limit.If this is in a software-based scenario... This probably doesn't apply.P.S.: When I was writing this, I felt in 2008 and dealing IPv6 firmware upgrades of some Cisco routers.I tested this in a virtualized environment using EVE-NG, so hardware offload and TCAM limitations should not apply in this case. Since the issue occurs in a purely software-based scenario, it seems more likely to be a RouterOS bug rather than a hardware limitation.

/file/printis still very buggy in beta4 when there are lots of files and/or multiple disks:This will never change, if they won't revise their file management mechanism.What if you have 100K files on SMB share for example? After adding a disk, it will start to scan aWHOLEstructure and create a huge load on your network for a very long time. And if you reboot, this process will begin again.There should be completely new mechanism. In WinBox there should be a file manager with abiliy to browse between folders without scanning a whole file structure. Same in CLI, if you issue/file printcommand, it should only show a content in a root directory (or another directory if you specify it in "where").Without this, working with large amount of files is impossible.

Would it be possible to add serial to the CEF logs?  I do it by adding prefix to all logs. This works but has to be added manually to each rule.So instead of this:2025-02-01T09:49:13.642+0100 hAP-test CEF:0|MikroTik|hAP ac^2|7.18beta4 (testing)|65|dns|Unknown|dvchost=hAP-test dvc=192.168.10.14 msg=serial\=BEED0B3AAAAA MikroTik: done query: #21 upgrade.mikrotik.com 159.148.147.251To some like this (dvchost also removed since its already in start of the logs2025-02-01T09:49:13.642+0100 hAP-test CEF:0|MikroTik|hAP ac^2|7.18beta4 (testing)|BEED0B3AAAAA|65|dns|Unknown|dvc=192.168.10.14 msg=done query: #21 upgrade.mikrotik.com 159.148.147.251This way I do not need the prefix at all.   We need serial number in the Splunk logs to make sure its a unique unit.   You may at some time change your main router to another model keeping the name.  This will mess stuff up since its not the same router any more.Since not all MikroTik do has serial, I did just made the script so it sets a random number.  This may be handled better by MikroTik to give it an unique ID.Code:Select all:do{:setserial([/system routerboardgetserial-number])}on-error={:setserial([:rndstrfrom=ABCDEF0123456 length=12])}

The "LAN devices receive advertised IPv6 addresses from all VLANs" is that referring to Windows devices that are on ports with tagged VLANs present.As that is a Windows bug, has nothing to do with RouterOS.Thanks for the reply. The issue is not with Windows I have it with both Linux containers and Raspberypi directly connected to the router + other devices showing strange beahvior.My setup looks something like this:Router (RB5009) <==(tagged)==> CRS309 <==(untagged)==> Lan ports, Wifi AP, IoT AP, VMs (KVM connected to intel SFP+)Router (RB5009) <==(untagged with PVID)==> raspberry pi* VLAN filtering is enabled on both router and switch with vlan-tagged only admission + ingress filter and IGMP snooping on both bridges and both devices on the latest 7.18-beta4It seems RA is somehow STILL leaking between VLANs. I can see leaked in Linux dev (that is connected via untagged access port, it is only supposed to get :3: one):inet6 2a02:***:3:**/128 scope global dynamic noprefixrouteinet6 2a02:***:3:**/64 scope global dynamic noprefixrouteinet6 2a02:***:1:**/64 scope global deprecated dynamic noprefixrouteinet6 2a02:***:0:**/64 scope global deprecated dynamic noprefixrouteinet6 2a02:***:2:**/64 scope global deprecated dynamic noprefixroute(the prefixes are assigned from a /48 pool each for a VLAN. routeros assigned 0,1,2,3)Apple devices seem to behave strangely. They randomly activate ipv6 or not and sometimes lose it shortly (I guess because wrong packets are still being leaked.(it might not be exactly related to this beta release but only reporting here as just having this issue. if it is more appropriate to make a new discussion I can do)

... IGMP snooping on both bridges and both devices on the latest 7.18-beta4RAs are multicast ... so IGMP snooping might be playing foul game here. Try to disable it to see if that's the case.

it certainly is related to the configuration as I have a similar network (IPv6 with different /64 on tagged VLANs) running without issue.so make a new topic including /export of bridge and ipv6.

Every single device on my network have different names.When I replace the device, the new still have the same name, so, not worry about serials....If you for example handles a big customer, he uses the city name as the router name.Then at a time later you add another customer with the same naming idea.  Serial number will be unique all time.Not this happens often, but I have seen it in my life ;)

unfortunately the routing itself doesn't work anyway:Routes are only in BGP table and not in L3VPN RIB, except locally connected routes.Exactly the conclusion I felt!And I'll say more... The beeps on my "guess-o-meter" indicate that this has to do with a route recursing to a destination that is not in the FIB.In this case a label, which is represented by a RD/RT. And what's more interesting... A label that works for IPv4 but not for IPv6.I haven't had the time and patience to test this new testing version yet. But I believe that if you do tests with "Next-Hop-Self" or use static routes and try to manipulate the NLRI in the route import filters, I imagine that this L3VPN v6 over LDPv4 scenario can work.I still believe that all of this may be related to this united-but-separate way of displaying IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, etc. routes.In the MikroTik world, "What is RIB?", "What is FIB?", "Are FIBv4 and FIBv6 united or separate?".

IIRC last worked with 7.17beta2 or 7.16.xFlags: U - UNREACHABLE; b - BGPUb 2001:db8::/48&65000:105  ::ffff:10.0.0.1  vpn6       200     40            30

Currently IPv4 mapped gateways cannot be resolved. You have to change the gateway to valid ipv6 address with routing filters.It means it could works without LDPv6? LDPv6 is problematic in interop environment.
