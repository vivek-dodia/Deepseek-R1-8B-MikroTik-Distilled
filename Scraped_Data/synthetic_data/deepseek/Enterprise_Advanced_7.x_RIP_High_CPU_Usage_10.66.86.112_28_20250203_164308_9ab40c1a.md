# Analysis Process
Okay, let's tackle this MikroTik RIP troubleshooting scenario. The user wants a detailed enterprise-level case with high CPU usage on RouterOS 7.x in a cloud environment. First, I need to outline each section as specified.

Starting with the initial problem report. Symptoms include high CPU, network slowness, and RIP routes missing. Affected users are 842 over 13 hours. That's a significant outage, so the impact is high.

Next, the environment. It's a cloud setup with two MikroTik routers in HA, two switches, and a /28 subnet. I'll need to create a Mermaid diagram showing the connections. The cloud gateway connects to both routers, which link to the switches and then to VMs. RIP is running between the routers and the cloud gateway.

Initial assessment steps: Check CPU usage with /system resource print. Look at RIP neighbors and routes. Maybe the CPU is spiking due to RIP processes. Logs might show RIP updates flapping.

Debugging process: Use commands like /routing rip neighbor print, /routing rip route print, and monitor traffic with /tool sniffer. Also, check the routing table and logs. If RIP is sending too many updates, maybe the timers are misconfigured or there's a loop causing excessive updates.

Root cause analysis: Suppose the issue is a misconfigured RIP update interval, causing rapid updates that overload the CPU. Maybe the cloud gateway was set to 5 seconds instead of the default 30, leading to constant processing.

Solution steps: Adjust the RIP timers to default, add route filters if necessary, and ensure authentication is correct. Update configurations on both routers and the gateway.

Verification: Check CPU usage again, ensure RIP routes are stable, and test connectivity. Prevention would involve proper timer settings, route filtering, and monitoring.

Pitfalls to avoid: Not checking timer settings, ignoring route filtering, or missing authentication mismatches. Also, not testing in a staging environment before deploying.

Need to include CLI commands with comments, example logs showing frequent updates, before/after configs. Make sure commands are for RouterOS 7.x. Also, reference related commands and common mistakes.

Let me structure each section step by step, ensuring all points are covered. Use code blocks for commands and logs, Mermaid for topology. Check that the subnet 172.18.190.112/28 is appropriately placed in the network diagram. Maybe the VMs are in that subnet.

Wait, in the environment, the affected subnet is part of the cloud infrastructure. So the VMs are on that /28 subnet. The RIP routes would be advertising this subnet. If the routers aren't processing RIP correctly, the routes might be missing, causing connectivity issues.

In the key findings, maybe the RIP update timer mismatch between MikroTik and the cloud gateway caused excessive updates. The MikroTik's default is 30s, but the cloud gateway was set to 5s, leading to constant route updates and high CPU.

In the solution, adjust the update interval on the cloud gateway to match. But since the user can't change the cloud gateway settings, maybe adjust the MikroTik's timers instead, though that's not ideal. Alternatively, implement route filtering to reduce the number of routes processed.

Also, ensure that authentication is correctly configured. If the cloud gateway uses MD5 auth and MikroTik is not, that could cause issues, but the problem here is high CPU, not authentication failures. So maybe the main issue is the update frequency.

Need to make sure all sections flow logically. Check that each part answers the user's query comprehensively.

# MikroTik RouterOS Troubleshooting Scenario: RIP High CPU Usage

## 1. Initial Problem Report and Symptoms
**Reported Issue**: Network performance degradation affecting 842 users in cloud environment  
**Symptoms**:
- Sustained 90-95% CPU usage on edge routers
- Intermittent packet loss (15-20%) in 172.18.190.112/28 subnet
- RIP routes periodically disappearing from routing table
- Increased latency (300-400ms) for cloud-hosted applications
- System logs show frequent RIP update timeouts

## 2. Environment Description
**Network Topology**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Cloud Gateway] -->|RIP| B[RouterOS-1 (172.18.190.113)]
    A -->|RIP| C[RouterOS-2 (172.18.190.114)]
    B --> D[Switch-1]
    C --> E[Switch-2]
    D --> F[VM Cluster 1]
    E --> F
    D --> G[VM Cluster 2]
    E --> G
```

## 3. Initial Assessment Steps
1. Verify CPU load:
```bash
/system resource print
```
```log
           cpu: 94%
     free-memory: 54.3MiB
  total-memory: 256.0MiB
```

2. Check active RIP neighbors:
```bash
/routing rip neighbor print
```
```log
 0 interface=ether1 address=172.18.190.97 status=established
```

3. Monitor interface statistics:
```bash
/interface monitor-traffic ether1
```
```log
rx-packets-per-second: 12,345
tx-packets-per-second: 11,234
```

## 4. Detailed Debugging Process
**Step 1: Identify CPU-intensive processes**
```bash
/system process print where cpu-percent>10
```
```log
 0 name=rip cpu=83% memory=12.3MiB 
```

**Step 2: Analyze RIP routing table**
```bash
/routing rip route print detail
```
```log
 0 dst-address=172.18.190.112/28 gateway=172.18.190.97 metric=1 timeout=13s
```

**Step 3: Capture RIP packets**
```bash
/tool sniffer quick protocol=udp port=520
```
```log
17:23:45 rx 172.18.190.97:520 -> 224.0.0.9:520 RIP-Response 42 routes
17:23:47 rx 172.18.190.97:520 -> 224.0.0.9:520 RIP-Response 42 routes
```

**Step 4: Check routing configuration**
```bash
/routing rip instance print
```
```log
 0 name="cloud-core" redistribute=static,connected update-interval=30s
```

## 5. Key Findings and Root Cause
**Root Cause**: 
- Cloud gateway misconfigured with 5-second RIP updates (default=30s)
- Route flap from 42 dynamically learned routes causing constant recalculations
- Missing route filters leading to processing of unnecessary routes

**Evidence**:
```log
[rip] DEBUG: Received 42 routes from 172.18.190.97
[rip] DEBUG: Full routing table recalculation started
```

## 6. Solution Implementation
**Before**:
```bash
/routing rip instance set [find name="cloud-core"] update-interval=30s
```

**After**:
```bash
/routing rip instance set [find name="cloud-core"] update-interval=30s \
    route-filter=acl-cloud-only

/routing rip access-group add prefix=172.18.190.96/27 interface=ether1
```

## 7. Verification Process
1. CPU load check:
```bash
/system resource print
```
```log
           cpu: 24%
```

2. Validate stable routes:
```bash
/routing rip route print
```
```log
 0 dst-address=172.18.190.112/28 stable=5m23s
```

3. End-user validation:
```bash
/ping 172.18.190.120 count=10 interval=100ms
```
```log
 10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss
```

## 8. Prevention Measures
1. Implement route filtering:
```bash
/routing filter rule add chain=rip-in prefix=172.18.190.96/27 action=accept
```

2. Enable RIP authentication:
```bash
/routing rip interface set [find interface=ether1] authentication=md5 \
    authentication-key=secretkey
```

3. Set monitoring alerts:
```bash
/system health set [find] on-temperature-high="log warning CPU temp high"
```

## 9. Related Commands Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/routing rip monitor` | Real-time RIP event monitoring |
| `/tool profile` | CPU usage per-process breakdown |
| `/ip route export` | Compare routing tables before/after |

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Avoid** mixing RIP versions:
```bash
# WRONG: Causes version mismatch
/routing rip interface set ether1 version=1
```

2. **Never** disable route validation:
```bash
# RISKY: Allows invalid routes
/routing rip instance set check-garbage=no
```

3. **Prevent** route feedback loops:
```bash
# GOOD PRACTICE: Route filtering
/routing filter rule add chain=rip-out action=reject
```
```markdown
**Final Note**: Always test RIP configuration changes in staging environment before production deployment.
