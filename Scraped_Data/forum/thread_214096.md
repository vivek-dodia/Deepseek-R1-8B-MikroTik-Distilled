Hi all,Having changed ISP I no longer have a static IP address so in preparation I moved from a GRE tunnel to my CoLo to a Wireguard one.The tunnel is between two RB5009s. Colo is dedicated 1Gbit and home is 1Gbps down and 100Mbps up.Using GRE at it's peak performance I was reaching a download from the Colo or approx 800 to 900Mbps, CPU usage on devices of approx 30%With Wireguard lt's rarely higher than 200Mbps.CPU Usage of 45% Tried changing MTU on Wireguard from 1420 to 1440 and no difference.I assume I'm hitting limitations of Wireguard performance on the devices? Would have expected better to be honest!Config is as basic as it gets which is par for the course for wireguard: IP Address at each end - routes via OSPFColo:Code:Select allHome:Code:Select all

```
## any site2site IN/OUT with WAN addr (very permissive here, need to bet more filtered)
/ip firewall raw
add action=accept chain=prerouting comment="site2site prevent fasttrack" \
    in-interface-list=wan src-address-list=pub_site50
add action=accept chain=output comment="site2site prevent fasttrack" \
    dst-address-list=pub_site70 out-interface-list=wan

## all through the WG tunnel 
/ip firewall raw
add action=accept chain=prerouting comment="remote prevent fasttrack" \
    in-interface-list=remote
add action=accept chain=output comment="remote prevent fasttrack" \
    out-interface-list=remote

Hi,I've use a WG between two RB5009 with a fiber symetric 1G between two sites.I added the following rules on both sides, here, it's just one, to avoid site2site traffic to be fastracked.Code:Select all

Added a no track raw rule for the wireguard tunnel subnet:Code:Select allPerformance was worse but CPU usage was significantly less - about 15% to 20% vs 40% to 50% but then again this seems to correspond neatly with throughput.Half the throughput = half the CPU usage!iperf3Jan25-04.pngAnd with the raw rule removed again:iperf3Jan25-05.png
