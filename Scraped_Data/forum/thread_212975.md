Is there any other way to use a VPN even if my ISP is blocked Wireguard?I have tried to change port 443, 8295 for wireguard but it's not connectingWireGuard is not connectingfound this error in logs:wireguard1: [test] KQf3CazJ+nfylMl+Nnajsfnjsd TUT6yoyX/xbxPNzEE=: Handshake for peer did not complete after 5 seconds, retrying (try 2).It may look like:WG peer Client Listen port 51820 is blocked by ISP

Try BTH.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... ck+To+Home

If the ISP is blocking wireguard, the fact that you have tried numerous ports tells me that they are checking DPI,  into the weeds to see the type of traffic.Therefore suggesting BTH is fruitless.However, if the  lack of connection is eithera. operator config errorb. no access to public IPThen BTH may help alleviate both. :-0So question to OP,  is your config correct and do you have a public IP.

ikev2 (ipsec) is well supported, and there are fairly good examples around.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... enticationThis is more industrial, so perhaps less likely to be dropped.But if your ISP doesn't want you running VPN's. You will struggle.

Or change ISP ?A party blocking VPN is not worth to receive your money.

Yup, it's not a matter of switching the ISP, it's a matter of switching the country. AmneziaWG seems to be successful in addressing this type of issue, but you need a Mikrotik that supports containers or a completely different hardware. Depending on the country, it may or may not be enough.

SSTP looks almost like a normal HTTPS connection but it is relatively slow. The initial packets of all other VPN protocols are quite distinctive so easy to spot using DPI and therefore easy to block. AmneziaWG targets exactly this.

AmneziaWG targets exactly this.Scenario is thatI have Mikrotik CHR on Digital Ocean. We are using CHR as a WireGuard Server.We have installed the WG application on Android and iPhone, ISP blocks this and we can't establish a connection with CHR-WireGuard Server.In this case How I can deploy  AmneziaWG?orI need to deploy any other machine for AmneziaWG on Cloud?

I do know people who run containers on CHRs running in the cloud, because it is simpler than to set up a separate virtual machine there. But keeping a CHR only as a host for a single container would make little sense so maybe spawning a dedicated Debian machine may be a better choice for you - I don't have enough information to recommend you any of these variants.

Leave server as is, and try Amnezia client for smartphone. Amnezia client needs exactly same config as usual wg (qr scan almost dead, import client config works fine). Don't forget to switch on obfuscation checkbox.2. If there is no luck with #1,  try clean vps (without router os, just clean any kind of os like Ubuntu) with libreswan.Here is ready script for most OS:https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpnUse strongSwan smartPhone app , import file xxx.sswan which will be generated as a result of #2.I have couple of cases with pretty same problems, both #1 and #2 work fine.

What speeds do you achieve? Are you sure, you have full tunnel and not maybe some split tunnelig? Because AmneziaWG isn't realy much different then ordinary WG, so anything, that worked there, should also work with AmneziaWG.¸It could also be MTU issue. Many times, when some sites don't load it's a MTU issue.

Many times, when some sites don't load it's a MTU issue.There is a bit of difference between when scrolling up on YouTube, Insta etc also on speed test a bit differenceon ROS I have default MTU.

Well, i was asking for something like speedtest.net results.Try with this in firewall mangle rule. See if it fixes anything.Code:Select alladdaction=change-mss chain=forward comment="Clamp MTU to PMTU"disabled=yesnew-mss=clamp-to-pmtu passthrough=yes protocol=tcp tcp-flags=syn

I only copied it from my 5009. I'm not using that rule right now and that is why it's disabled. I found it in such form (without interface) somewhere on the internet or even maybe on this forum.Thanks for fixing it.
