Something is wrong with IPSEC at ROS 7.17rc6...At another machine (x86) with ROS 7.17rc6 - there is non-stop 100% CPU (see screenschot) - when there is no VPN or any other IPSEC connetion to that router!!!Does anyone has problem with VPN's on taht ROS version?

MikroTik team repaired that problem, and now at ROS ver 7.17rc8 it works (L2TP with IPSEC on CCR2116). Thank You MikroTik!

Good dayI am having problems when I try to use IPsec with a L2TP connection, I have ports 4500,500,1701, protocol 50 (ipsec-esp) and 51 (ipsec-ah), phase 1 never passes. If I disable IPsec, the VPN works.I'm not sure what's going on with this new version of RouterOS.I really appreciate your help.
