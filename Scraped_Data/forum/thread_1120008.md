http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:In ... LAN#Q-in-QWrong...Example in wiki is not like my examples... As you can see - Cisco config uses one S-VLAN and massive C-VLANs, or we can use any vlan id for C-VLAN and one S-VLAN. Juniper config is more complex - any combination is possible...

bda is looking for a way to have SP-vlans dynamically created, or created in blocks such as in the examples.This is a pretty common requirement, im suprised it's not already a feature.

there is no news about this? I checked a same request in a post of 2006, I don't know why mikrotik didn't develop this until now.
