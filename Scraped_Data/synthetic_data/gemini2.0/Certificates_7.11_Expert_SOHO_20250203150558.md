Okay, let's delve into managing certificates on MikroTik RouterOS 7.11, focusing on the specified scenario: a SOHO network, subnet 120.59.244.0/24, and interface "wlan-26". This will be an expert-level exploration, assuming a solid understanding of MikroTik concepts.

## Scenario Description:

We'll focus on generating and managing certificates for the `wlan-26` interface. This might be for secure services like HTTPS web access to the router's web interface, a secure API endpoint, or for use in secure wireless authentication mechanisms (like EAP-TLS or PEAP). We will use a self-signed certificate for demonstration and explanation, although in production scenarios, a proper certificate from a trusted certificate authority is highly recommended.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide with explanations, CLI examples, and the effect each step has.

1.  **Step 1: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate.**
    *   **Explanation:** We'll start by creating a root CA (Certificate Authority) certificate which we'll then use to sign the actual server certificate to be used.
    *   **Before (Assumed State):** No certificates exist.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /certificate
        add name=root-ca common-name=ca.example.com key-usage=key-cert-sign,crl-sign,digital-signature,key-encipherment
        /certificate sign root-ca
        ```

    * **Explanation of CLI Parameters:**
        -   `add name=root-ca`:  Creates a new certificate named "root-ca".
        -   `common-name=ca.example.com`: The common name is the subject of the certificate, here it's a placeholder.
        -   `key-usage=key-cert-sign,crl-sign,digital-signature,key-encipherment`: The intended purposes of the key.
        -   `sign root-ca`: signs the newly created root-ca certificate.
    *   **After (Expected State):** A root certificate "root-ca" exists, and the signed flag is set to yes.
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to System->Certificates and observe the new certificate.

2.  **Step 2: Create a Server Certificate**
    *   **Explanation:** Now, create a certificate specifically for this router.
    *   **Before:** Only the root-ca certificate exists.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /certificate
        add name=server-cert common-name=router.example.com key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,server-auth
        /certificate sign server-cert ca=root-ca
        ```
    *   **Explanation of CLI Parameters:**
        -   `add name=server-cert`:  Creates a new certificate named "server-cert".
        -  `common-name=router.example.com`: The common name for this router. In a real world scenario, this would likely be a FQDN.
        -   `key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,server-auth`: The purposes of this key. Note the `server-auth`, important for server based services like WebFig and API.
        -   `sign server-cert ca=root-ca`: signs the newly created server-cert, using the root-ca as the CA.
    *   **After:** Both "root-ca" and "server-cert" exist. "server-cert" is signed by "root-ca"
    *   **Winbox GUI:** In System->Certificates, a second certificate now exists and its issuer is set to the root-ca.

3.  **Step 3: Configure a Service to use the Certificate (WebFig as an example)**
    *   **Explanation:** Let's configure the web server to use our new certificate.
    *   **Before:** WebFig is likely using a default self-signed certificate.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip service set www certificate=server-cert
        /ip service set www-ssl certificate=server-cert
        ```
    *   **Explanation of CLI Parameters:**
        - `/ip service set www certificate=server-cert`: sets the certificate for the WebFig port 80.
        - `/ip service set www-ssl certificate=server-cert`: sets the certificate for the https service.
    *   **After:** Both the www service and the www-ssl service are using the new "server-cert".
    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigage to IP->Services. Click on www and www-ssl. Both should now have the specified certificate.

## Complete Configuration Commands:
```mikrotik
/certificate
add name=root-ca common-name=ca.example.com key-usage=key-cert-sign,crl-sign,digital-signature,key-encipherment
sign root-ca

add name=server-cert common-name=router.example.com key-usage=digital-signature,key-encipherment,server-auth
sign server-cert ca=root-ca

/ip service set www certificate=server-cert
/ip service set www-ssl certificate=server-cert
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect `key-usage` settings.  If the certificate doesn't have the required key usage flags (like `server-auth` for a web server), services will likely refuse to start using the certificate.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that each certificate has the correct key usages based on its intended purpose. Recreate the certificate if needed.
*   **Pitfall:** Misconfiguration when using certificates issued from a trusted CA.
    *   **Solution:** Use the proper commands to import the certificate and CA certificate. Ensure the whole certificate chain is present on the router, and that the router is configured to trust the CA.
*   **Pitfall:** Expired Certificates.
    *   **Solution:** Regularly monitor certificates for their expiration dates, and replace them when they expire. Set up automated certificate renewal processes if possible.
*   **Pitfall:** Resource exhaustion from the certificate generation/signing process.
    *   **Solution:** Certificate operations can be CPU intensive. Monitor resource utilization, and generate or sign certificates when the router is not under heavy load.
*  **Pitfall:** The "server-auth" key-usage not present on a certificate. Webfig (or API, or any other service) will fail to use a certificate without the server-auth flag.
   *  **Solution:** Check the key-usage on the certificate. If it is incorrect, recreate it with the correct flags.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

*   **Verification Step 1: Check Certificate Status**
    *   **CLI Command:** `/certificate print`
    *   **Expected Output:** Ensure the "root-ca" and "server-cert" exist. Check "issuer" on "server-cert" to verify it is "root-ca" and check that the flags for signing is set to "yes".
*   **Verification Step 2: Connect to WebFig over HTTPS**
    *   **Procedure:** Open a web browser and navigate to `https://<router_ip>`.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** No browser security warnings should show due to using a non trusted certificate (if it is the first time, it will likely show a warning). Your browser should show the connection is encrypted with the newly generated certificate.
    *   **Additional Verification:** Check the certificate details in your web browser to ensure it is the "server-cert" certificate created on your router.
* **Verification Step 3: Check the Service Usage**
   *   **CLI Command:** `/ip service print`
    * **Expected Output:** Verify that the specified `certificate` property on both `www` and `www-ssl` are configured to the server-cert.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs):** For more complex setups, you would use CRLs to revoke compromised certificates.
*   **Automated Certificate Management:** Use scripts or external tools to automatically renew certificates, especially for production environments.
*   **RADIUS Authentication:** Certificates can be used for more secure RADIUS EAP authentication (EAP-TLS).
*   **API Security:** Certificates can be used to secure the MikroTik REST API.
*   **Let's Encrypt:** MikroTik can use Let's Encrypt to automatically get certificates from a trusted CA.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Let's add a certificate through the API

**API Endpoint:** `/certificate`

**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "name": "api-server-cert",
  "common-name": "api.example.com",
  "key-usage": "digital-signature,key-encipherment,server-auth",
  "ca": "root-ca"
}
```
**Expected Response** (Success): 201 (Created)

**Example API call (using curl):**

```bash
curl -k -u <username>:<password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "api-server-cert", "common-name": "api.example.com", "key-usage": "digital-signature,key-encipherment,server-auth", "ca": "root-ca" }'  https://<router_ip>/rest/certificate
```

**Error Handling:**
If parameters are wrong (like missing a name), the API returns a 400 Bad Request. The response will often contain an error message describing the issue. You should inspect the response status and any error messages.

```json
{
"message": "invalid value for argument common-name",
"error": 1
}
```

## Security Best Practices

*   **Secure Private Keys:** Always protect your private keys.
*   **Use Strong Passwords:** For devices and for any stored private key passwords.
*   **Regularly Review Certificates:** Regularly check the certificates on the device to ensure there are no expired or unexpected certificates.
*   **Avoid Self-Signed Certificates in Production:** Use certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities for production systems.
*   **HTTPS Only:** Always use HTTPS for Webfig/API access.
*   **Limit access to management:** Use firewall rules to limit access to management ports like Webfig, SSH and the REST API.
*   **Limit API access:** When using the REST API, always restrict API access with proper authentication and authorization techniques.
*   **Stay up to date:** Update the router with the latest stable version of RouterOS.
*   **Implement best practices:** Enforce industry-standard security best practices.

## Self Critique and Improvements

*   **Improvement:** The self-signed certificate is not ideal for production. We should obtain a valid certificate for public facing services using Let's Encrypt or another CA.
*   **Improvement:**  Automated certificate renewal is missing. A script to handle that process would be an ideal addition.
*   **Improvement:** No validation is done on imported or created certificates to ensure validity. This should be added to any process that creates or imports certificates.
*  **Improvement:** In this example, we've applied the generated server certificate on both the http and https services, which is not ideal as it could cause some issues with http redirections to https, and generally it's better to use the `www-ssl` certificate option for https connections only.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

Certificates on MikroTik RouterOS use X.509 format. These certificates are digital identity documents that prove the identity of a device or a user.  Certificates use public key cryptography, which involves a key pair; the private key, which is kept secret, and the public key, which can be shared. The private key is used to sign documents, and the corresponding public key is used to verify the signature.

In a typical certificate setup, a Certificate Authority (CA) issues certificates.  The CA itself has a certificate (the root CA certificate), which is implicitly trusted.  Other certificates are signed with the CA's private key, creating a chain of trust. If you trust the root CA, you can also trust all of its signed certificates.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Self-Signed vs. CA-Signed Certificates:** Self-signed certificates are easier to generate but are not trusted by default, resulting in browser security warnings. CA-signed certificates require more setup but provide trusted identities and eliminate those warnings.
*   **Performance:** Generating or verifying certificates can be CPU intensive, especially on less powerful routers. However, this is usually a one-time action on startup or renewal, and it has minimal impact on actual packet processing speeds. Using hardware acceleration for encryption, if available, will help this process.
*   **Complexity:** Certificate management, especially for larger networks, can be complex. Automation is important to make it easier to handle certificates on a large scale.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:
The commands listed here should work with any version of RouterOS 7.x. The command `/certificate` is available since RouterOS v6.35. Commands relating to the REST API is version 6.41+. If you were running 6.x you would want to check which features are available on your specific version using the documentation on the MikroTik website.
