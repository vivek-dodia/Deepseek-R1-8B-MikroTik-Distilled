Okay, let's dive into creating a detailed technical document for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on a MikroTik router for a point-to-point link, using VLAN 35 within the 34.6.156.0/24 subnet.  We will target RouterOS 7.11, keeping in mind compatibility with 6.48 and other 7.x versions.

## Scenario Description:

This document outlines the configuration of a MikroTik router to establish a point-to-point link. We will configure IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on a VLAN interface named `vlan-35`, which is a common use case for segmenting networks and isolating traffic. The chosen subnet is 34.6.156.0/24 for IPv4.  For IPv6, a unique local address (ULA) range will be used. This setup is suitable for small to medium-sized point-to-point links, where addressing and network segmentation are required. This is often used for connecting two networks that require routed communication between them, usually over a wireless medium.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the router. We will present the commands in CLI format, as it provides a more precise representation.  Each step includes explanations before and after configurations.

1. **Step 1: Creating the VLAN Interface**
   * **Before:** The router will have base interfaces such as `ether1` or `wlan1` and others not yet configured with a vlan.
   * **Action:** We will create the `vlan-35` interface on an existing interface (e.g., `ether1`).  This needs a parent interface on which to build the vlan, `ether1` for this example.
   * **CLI Command:**
      ```mikrotik
      /interface vlan
      add name=vlan-35 vlan-id=35 interface=ether1
      ```
    *  **Explanation:**
         * `/interface vlan add`:  This command initiates the process of creating a new VLAN interface.
         * `name=vlan-35`: Assigns the name `vlan-35` to the new VLAN interface. This is how you refer to it in other configurations.
         * `vlan-id=35`: Sets the VLAN tag to `35`. This ensures that the traffic is properly tagged on the physical link.
         * `interface=ether1`: Specifies that this VLAN interface will be built upon `ether1`. The parent interface, which carries the VLAN traffic.
   * **After:** The router now has a VLAN interface named `vlan-35`. The interface is created but there is no address and is considered `slave` in the interfaces listing.

2.  **Step 2: Assigning an IPv4 Address**
    *  **Before:** The `vlan-35` interface exists but is not assigned any IPv4 address.
    *  **Action:** We assign an IP address from the `34.6.156.0/24` subnet to the `vlan-35` interface. We'll use `34.6.156.1/24` for this example, with a second device using 34.6.156.2/24.
    *  **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address
        add address=34.6.156.1/24 interface=vlan-35
        ```
    *  **Explanation:**
         * `/ip address add`: Initiates the process of adding a new IP address configuration.
         * `address=34.6.156.1/24`: Assigns the IPv4 address `34.6.156.1` with a `/24` subnet mask to the interface.
         * `interface=vlan-35`: Specifies that the IP address will be bound to `vlan-35` interface.
    * **After:** The router has an IPv4 address of `34.6.156.1/24` assigned to the `vlan-35` interface, making it capable of communication on the specified subnet.

3.  **Step 3: Assigning an IPv6 Address**
    * **Before:** The `vlan-35` interface is only configured with an IPv4 address.
    * **Action:** We will assign a unique local IPv6 address (ULA) to the `vlan-35` interface. For demonstration, we will use `fd00:1234:5678::1/64`, again using `::1` for one side and `::2` for the other side.
    * **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 address
        add address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64 interface=vlan-35
        ```
    * **Explanation:**
          * `/ipv6 address add`: Begins the process of adding a new IPv6 address configuration.
          * `address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64`: Assigns the IPv6 address `fd00:1234:5678::1` with a `/64` prefix length to the interface. This is a ULA.
          * `interface=vlan-35`: Specifies that the IPv6 address will be bound to `vlan-35` interface.
    * **After:** The `vlan-35` interface now also has an IPv6 address `fd00:1234:5678::1/64`, allowing it to communicate over IPv6.

4. **Step 4: (Optional) Add IPv6 NDP Discovery**
   * **Before:** IPv6 address is configured but neighbor discovery might be needed.
   * **Action:** Ensure that IPv6 neighbor discovery is enabled on the vlan-35 interface, so the other side can discover the address. This is handled by default in Mikrotik, but this would be required to change in other configurations if you disable NDP/RA.
   * **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 nd
        set [ find interface=vlan-35 ] advertise-router=yes
        ```
     * **Explanation**
       *  `/ipv6 nd`: Accesses IPv6 Neighbor Discovery configuration
       *  `set [ find interface=vlan-35 ]`: finds the interface vlan-35, and applies the settings within the `[]` brackets.
       * `advertise-router=yes`: This enables Router Advertisements so hosts on the network know about the router's presence.
   * **After:** Hosts on the VLAN can now detect the IPv6 address, allowing communication.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-35 vlan-id=35 interface=ether1
/ip address
add address=34.6.156.1/24 interface=vlan-35
/ipv6 address
add address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64 interface=vlan-35
/ipv6 nd
set [ find interface=vlan-35 ] advertise-router=yes
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **VLAN Tag Mismatch:** If the VLAN IDs do not match between the two end devices or a switch, communication will fail.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the `vlan-id` on all devices.
*   **Firewall Issues:** MikroTik firewalls can block traffic between interfaces.
    *   **Solution:**  Add firewall rules to allow traffic on the `vlan-35` interface. Consider allowing `in-interface=vlan-35` to allow anything coming into the interface to be accepted and forwarded.
*   **Incorrect Subnet Masks:**  Using incorrect subnet masks can lead to routing issues and devices not being able to reach each other.
    *   **Solution:** Confirm the subnet mask is correct (`/24` for IPv4, `/64` for IPv6 in this case).
*   **Misconfigured IPv6:** Failure to enable IPv6 forwarding or router advertisements can prevent IPv6 connectivity.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure `advertise-router` is enabled, and check that `ipv6/settings forwarding` is enabled.
* **Missing ARP on layer 2**: You may need to enable ARP on the bridge if you have bridge configuration. This is not used in the example but could be an issue.
  * **Solution**: Enable ARP `arp=enabled`.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Ping IPv4:**
    *   On the other end of the link, try to ping `34.6.156.1`.
    *   **CLI Command on the destination router:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ping 34.6.156.1
        ```
    *  Successful pings confirm basic IPv4 connectivity.
2.  **Ping IPv6:**
    *  Similarly, try to ping the IPv6 address `fd00:1234:5678::1` from the other end of the link.
    *  **CLI Command on the destination router:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 ping fd00:1234:5678::1
        ```
    *   Successful pings confirm IPv6 connectivity.
3. **Interface Monitoring:**
   * Use `/interface monitor vlan-35` on both sides to see if traffic is actually flowing over the interface.
   * **CLI Command**
    ```mikrotik
     /interface monitor vlan-35
    ```
   * The rx-byte, and tx-byte counters should increase over time, indicating data flow.
4.  **Torch Tool:** Use the Torch tool on the `vlan-35` interface to monitor traffic in real time. This can show packet details.
   *  **CLI Command:**
      ```mikrotik
      /tool torch interface=vlan-35
      ```
     * This will show a real time view of all packets, and their source/destination addresses and ports.
5.  **Traceroute:** On the other end, use traceroute to verify the path to the configured addresses.
    *   **CLI Command:**
        ```mikrotik
        /tool traceroute 34.6.156.1
        /ipv6 traceroute fd00:1234:5678::1
        ```

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules to allow or deny traffic to and from the `vlan-35` interface as required.
*   **Quality of Service (QoS):**  Implement QoS rules to prioritize traffic on the VLAN. This would be important if VoIP or other real time data is sent across this interface.
*   **Routing Protocols:** Use routing protocols such as OSPF or BGP to exchange routes if the point-to-point link is part of a larger network.
*   **Bridging:** If the VLAN is part of a bridge, ensure that the bridge's settings also support VLAN tagging. If needed, make sure the bridge has `vlan-filtering=yes`.
*   **Security:** Ensure your firewall rules are in place to avoid unexpected traffic on the interface.
*   **VLAN Trunking:** If this link goes through a switch, the port connecting to your device will need to be configured as a trunk port.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Here are REST API examples for adding the IPv4 address and vlan interface.  For full API documentation consult the Mikrotik Wiki. These commands would need an active, authenticated API session.

1.  **Create VLAN Interface:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/interface/vlan`
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **JSON Payload:**
        ```json
        {
          "name": "vlan-35",
          "vlan-id": 35,
          "interface": "ether1"
        }
        ```
    *   **Expected Response (201 Created):**
        ```json
        {
          ".id": "*10",
          "name": "vlan-35",
          "vlan-id": "35",
          "interface": "ether1",
          "mtu": "1500",
          "arp": "enabled",
          "disabled": "false"
        }
        ```
2.  **Add IPv4 Address:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
    *   **Method:** `POST`
    *   **JSON Payload:**
        ```json
        {
           "address": "34.6.156.1/24",
           "interface": "vlan-35"
        }
        ```
    * **Expected Response (201 Created):**
        ```json
       {
        ".id":"*1A",
        "address":"34.6.156.1/24",
        "interface":"vlan-35",
        "network":"34.6.156.0",
        "dynamic":"false",
        "invalid":"false",
        "disabled":"false"
       }
        ```
3. **Error Handling:** If the interface name is wrong, you will receive the following error in your payload:
   ```json
   {
        "message": "could not find interface with such name",
        "error": true,
        "code": 10,
        "data": {
        "field": "interface"
       }
    }
   ```
   In this case the code is 10, with data showing which field was invalid.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strong firewall rules to control traffic allowed through `vlan-35`. Only allow essential services.
*   **SSH/Winbox Access:** Restrict access to SSH and Winbox services. Only allow connections from authorized networks or sources. Use `IP/Service` with allowed interfaces.
*   **User Management:** Manage MikroTik users and passwords, using secure passwords and limiting user privileges. Limit the API user rights.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Avoid Default Credentials:** Do not use default administrative username/password.
*   **Address List Usage:** Use address lists to limit the scope of access rules or address ranges where needed.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Automation:** The configuration can be automated using scripting or configuration management tools to reduce manual effort.
*  **Logging**: If there are issues, logging can help track problems. Ensure logging on the firewall is enabled.
*  **Documentation:** Proper commenting on all config changes is important so other admins can easily find issues or changes. This is not part of this guide but would be good practice.
*   **Redundancy:** For critical links, add redundancy by using multiple links and routing protocols.
*   **Dynamic Routing**: If needed, use dynamic routing protocols like OSPF for easier route maintenance.
* **Multiple VLANs**: In a more complex config, multiple vlans may be used on the same parent interface, this would require additional changes to the config.
*   **Advanced IPv6:** This example only includes a basic IPv6 setup.  DHCPv6 can be added for automatic assignment.
*   **Interface bonding:** Another improvement is bonding or link aggregation of the parent interface if bandwidth requirements are high.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):** IP addressing is the foundation of network communication. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address system while IPv6 uses a 128-bit system, allowing significantly more addresses.
*   **Subnets:**  Subnets divide a larger IP range into smaller, manageable networks. Subnet masks determine the network and host portions of an IP address. In the example `/24` indicates 254 available host addresses, while `/64` in IPv6 usually means a full subnet, due to the massive number of addresses.
*   **VLANs (Virtual LANs):** VLANs segment a physical network into multiple logical networks. This allows you to isolate traffic and manage different network segments on the same hardware. VLAN tags are used to differentiate traffic from different VLANs. In this case VLAN-ID 35.
*   **Unique Local Addresses (ULAs):**  In IPv6, ULAs are private addresses that are not globally routable. They are used for local communication within a private network or between networks that are not meant to be publicly accessible. These start with `fd` followed by a series of hex addresses.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Static vs. Dynamic Addressing:** Static IP addressing is simple but requires manual configuration, while dynamic addressing (DHCP) automates the process. Static is better in point to point links for reliability.
*   **VLAN vs. Physical Interface:** VLANs save physical ports by using logical interfaces but add complexity to the setup. Physical interfaces are simpler but use more hardware resources.
*   **ULA vs Global IPv6:** ULAs are simple to deploy and non-routable, and are generally used within an organization or a link. Global IPv6 addresses are uniquely addressable and routable, but need more infrastructure and management such as RIRs (Regional Internet Registries).
*   **Security vs Functionality**: For every feature added, security has to be a consideration, such as firewall rules, user access, and service availability. By adding features, the attack surface is increased and has to be hardened.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The configuration provided is compatible with RouterOS 7.11, 7.x, and 6.48. There are no significant changes to commands related to interface vlan/IP addressing between these versions. The only slight changes might be in the available options, which are generally more robust in the newer versions of RouterOS.

This detailed document should provide a solid foundation for configuring IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on a MikroTik router for a point-to-point link. Remember to always adapt these configurations to your specific network requirements.
