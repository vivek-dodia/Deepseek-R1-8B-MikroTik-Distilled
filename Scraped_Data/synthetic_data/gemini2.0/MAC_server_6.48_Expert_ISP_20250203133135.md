Okay, let's dive deep into configuring the MAC server feature on a MikroTik router, specifically for an ISP environment, using RouterOS 6.48.

## Scenario Description:

We need to configure a MAC server on our MikroTik router connected to VLAN 94, with the subnet `50.235.40.0/24`. This scenario is often used in ISP environments to provide DHCP services and potentially other layer 2 functionalities within a specific VLAN for customer equipment. The MAC server feature is a layer 2 discovery mechanism, and will send mac addresses back to the requesting client, typically for DHCP purposes.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the MAC server on your MikroTik router:

### Step 1: Ensure VLAN Interface is Configured

**Description:** Before configuring the MAC server, make sure the VLAN interface `vlan-94` is already created and configured. This step assumes that the underlying physical interface for this VLAN is already configured and operational, or that this is an access port using a VLAN tag.

**Before:** Let's assume `vlan-94` does *not* exist initially.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
# Check existing interfaces
/interface print
```

**Winbox GUI:** In Winbox, navigate to *Interfaces* menu, and check for `vlan-94`.

**Configuration:** We need to create the `vlan-94` interface. Assume `ether1` is our physical interface.  If an access port is required, create no VLAN interface but ensure the underlying physical port is set up correctly.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
/interface vlan add name=vlan-94 vlan-id=94 interface=ether1
/interface print
```
**Winbox GUI**: In the Interfaces menu, click "+", select "VLAN", and enter the name, VLAN ID, and interface.

**After:** The interface `vlan-94` is created, and will appear in the interface list.

### Step 2: Configure IP Address

**Description:** Assign an IP address to `vlan-94`. This address will be the gateway for hosts on this VLAN.

**Before:** The `vlan-94` interface is created, but has no IP address assigned yet.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
# Check existing IP addresses
/ip address print
```

**Configuration:**  Assign the address `50.235.40.1/24` to `vlan-94`.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
/ip address add address=50.235.40.1/24 interface=vlan-94
/ip address print
```

**Winbox GUI:**  Go to *IP* -> *Addresses*, click "+", and add the address and interface.

**After:**  The interface `vlan-94` now has an IP address assigned and is active.

### Step 3: Configure MAC Server

**Description:** Enable and configure the MAC server on the `vlan-94` interface. This is a layer 2 function, so it does not require an IP address assignment.

**Before:** No MAC server configuration exists.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
/interface mac-server print
```

**Configuration:** Enable MAC server on the `vlan-94` interface.

**CLI Example:**

```mikrotik
/interface mac-server add interface=vlan-94 disabled=no
/interface mac-server print
```

**Winbox GUI:** Navigate to *Interface* -> *MAC Server*, click "+", and select the interface. Ensure `disabled` is not ticked.

**After:** The MAC server is active on interface `vlan-94`.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here are the complete set of commands to configure the MAC server with explanations:

```mikrotik
# Create the VLAN interface
/interface vlan add name=vlan-94 vlan-id=94 interface=ether1
# Set an IP address for the VLAN
/ip address add address=50.235.40.1/24 interface=vlan-94
# Enable MAC server on vlan-94
/interface mac-server add interface=vlan-94 disabled=no

# View configuration (for confirmation)
/interface print
/ip address print
/interface mac-server print
```
**Parameter Explanation:**
* `/interface vlan add`: Creates a VLAN interface.
  * `name`: The name of the VLAN interface (`vlan-94`).
  * `vlan-id`: The VLAN ID (`94`).
  * `interface`: The physical interface to which the VLAN is attached (`ether1`).

* `/ip address add`:  Assigns an IP address to an interface.
  * `address`: The IP address and subnet mask (`50.235.40.1/24`).
  * `interface`: The interface to assign the address to (`vlan-94`).

* `/interface mac-server add`: Creates a new MAC server instance.
    * `interface`: The interface on which the MAC server is enabled (`vlan-94`).
    * `disabled`: Set to `no` to enable the MAC server.
    * **Important Note:** There are other settings such as:
        * `allowed-mac-addresses`: A list of mac addresses, or none to allow all mac addresses
        * `timeout`: How long the mac will be "remembered" for before being removed.

* `/interface print`: Displays all configured interfaces.
* `/ip address print`: Displays all configured IP addresses.
* `/interface mac-server print`: Displays configured MAC servers.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **VLAN Mismatch:** Ensure the VLAN ID on the MikroTik and the connected devices is correct.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the VLAN ID in the `interface vlan add` command and the connected devicesâ€™ configuration.
*   **Physical Interface Errors:**  Ensure the physical interface (e.g., `ether1`) is operational, connected and not faulty.
    *   **Solution:** Check link status and cable connections. Use tools like `interface monitor` to check the interface state.
*   **MAC Server Disabled:** Accidentally disabling the MAC server is a common mistake.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that `disabled=no` in `/interface mac-server print`.
*   **Firewall Issues:** If any firewalls are active, it could block the communication between client and the mac-server.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the relevant ports/protocols are allowed in the firewall rules. Usually, layer 2 communication is not blocked unless explicit rules are in place to block broadcasts.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Interface Status:** Verify the `vlan-94` interface is running with a status of `up`.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface print where name=vlan-94
    ```
2. **IP Address Confirmation:** Verify the interface `vlan-94` has the IP address `50.235.40.1/24`.
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print where interface=vlan-94
    ```
3. **MAC Server Verification:** Verify the MAC server is active on the correct interface.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface mac-server print where interface=vlan-94
    ```
4. **Client Connection:** Connect a client device to the network segment that is configured for VLAN 94. The mac address should be visible to the mac-server.
    ```mikrotik
    /interface mac-server entry print
    ```
    *Example Output*:
   ```
    0   interface=vlan-94 mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 time-left=2m43s
   ```
   * **Description**: This shows a mac address that has been discovered via the mac-server functionality.

5.  **Torch Tool**: Use the `torch` tool to monitor the traffic on the interface.

    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=vlan-94
    ```
    Look for DHCP and other layer 2 broadcast packets originating from the client devices.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server:**  Typically, a MAC server is used in conjunction with a DHCP server. You would configure a DHCP server on `vlan-94` with an appropriate address pool and other settings. This should *NOT* be configured until the MAC server has been properly tested and configured.
*   **Bonding/Bridging:** You can combine VLANs with bonding or bridging for increased redundancy and capacity. You must ensure a MAC server is created for each interface or bridge required.
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** You might implement ACLs to restrict traffic flow on `vlan-94` for security.
*   **RADIUS Server:** MAC server entries are not typically stored in a Radius database. If mac address logging is required, an external radius server will be required.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While the MAC server feature itself doesn't have direct REST API endpoints for creation, you can manipulate its underlying interfaces. Here's how you can manage interfaces and other network settings via the REST API.

**Note:**  These examples assume you have an API user configured on your MikroTik router with appropriate permissions.  Replace placeholders with your actual credentials and router address.

**Example 1: Get all interfaces**
* **Endpoint:** `/interface`
* **Method:** `GET`
* **Request:**
```bash
curl -u apiuser:password -k "https://your_router_ip/rest/interface"
```
*   **Response (Example):**
```json
[
    {
        ".id": "*1",
        "name": "ether1",
        "type": "ether",
        "mtu": "1500",
        "actual-mtu": "1500",
        "mac-address": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
        "running": true,
        "enabled": true
    },
        {
        ".id": "*2",
        "name": "vlan-94",
        "type": "vlan",
        "mtu": "1500",
        "actual-mtu": "1500",
        "vlan-id": "94",
        "interface": "ether1",
        "running": true,
        "enabled": true
    }
]

```

**Example 2: Create a VLAN interface**
* **Endpoint:** `/interface/vlan`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
    "name": "vlan-100",
    "vlan-id": "100",
    "interface": "ether1"
}
```
* **API Call:**
```bash
curl -X POST -u apiuser:password -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "vlan-100", "vlan-id": "100", "interface": "ether1"}' "https://your_router_ip/rest/interface/vlan"
```
*   **Response (Success - 201 Created):**
```json
{
    "message": "added",
    "id": "*4"
}

```
* **Error Handling:** If creation fails, you'll receive a JSON response with a non-2xx HTTP status code and a `"message"` field indicating the error. Handle these errors to determine how the command needs to be re-issued.

**Example 3:  Set an IP address on an interface**

*   **Endpoint:** `/ip/address`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
    "address": "192.168.20.1/24",
     "interface": "vlan-100"
}
```
* **API Call:**
```bash
curl -X POST -u apiuser:password -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address": "192.168.20.1/24", "interface": "vlan-100"}' "https://your_router_ip/rest/ip/address"
```
*   **Response (Success - 201 Created):**
```json
{
    "message": "added",
    "id": "*5"
}
```

## Security Best Practices:

*   **API Access:**  Restrict API access only to trusted networks/IP addresses and always use strong passwords and keys. Disable the API entirely, if not required.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Use firewall rules to limit access to your router from untrusted networks.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:** Regular updates ensure the router has the latest security patches.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Check router logs for any suspicious activity and intrusion attempts.

## Self Critique and Improvements

This configuration provides a functional MAC server setup for a basic VLAN scenario. Here are some potential improvements:

*   **More Specific MAC Server Settings:** Specify `allowed-mac-addresses`, or `timeout` to limit the number of remembered mac-addresses.
*   **DHCP Server Integration:** Complete the setup by configuring the DHCP server on the same VLAN for assigning IP addresses.
*   **Detailed Logging:**  Configure more detailed logging for the MAC server and interface changes. This will aid in troubleshooting and auditing.
*   **Automated Backups:** Implement automated RouterOS configuration backups to recover from errors.
*   **Centralized Management:** If managing multiple MikroTik routers, implement a centralized management system using RouterOS The Dude or other tools.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic

A MAC server in MikroTik RouterOS is a feature that allows the router to listen on a given interface for layer 2 discovery messages. Specifically, when a host device initiates a DHCP request it typically sends a broadcast message at layer 2, where the source mac address of the requesting device is listed. This mac address is captured by the mac-server function on the given interface, and stored until either the `timeout` is triggered, or the mac address is manually removed. This functionality is often paired with other features such as DHCP to simplify network management.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Security Trade-offs:** Disabling the API or using strong passwords introduces a performance overhead.
*   **Resource Trade-offs:** Implementing detailed logging can consume storage. More mac addresses stored by the mac-server will require more memory usage by the device. The `timeout` setting should be used with caution, as setting this to a very high value will retain mac address that are no longer connected, resulting in excess storage in the mac server table.
*   **Complexity Trade-offs:** More complex configurations require more effort to manage, and troubleshooting can become more complex.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

All commands used in this example are compatible with RouterOS 6.48 and later versions. No specific commands have been used that are not available in these versions. However, the RouterOS REST API may have minor differences in behaviour and options across specific RouterOS versions.
