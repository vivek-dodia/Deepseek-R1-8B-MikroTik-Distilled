Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive guide on IP Pools within MikroTik RouterOS, tailored for an advanced SOHO environment, focusing on version 7.12 (but with considerations for 6.48 and other 7.x versions). This will be a deep dive, so buckle up!

# IP Pools in MikroTik RouterOS: A Detailed Guide

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and MikroTik Requirements

**Scenario:**

We have a SOHO network operating within the subnet `170.97.128.0/24`.  We want to create an IP pool to be used for dynamic assignment to devices connecting via a bridge interface named `bridge-23`. We will specifically configure an IP Pool that provides addresses from 170.97.128.10 to 170.97.128.200. We will then demonstrate how to use this Pool within a DHCP Server configuration to assign IP addresses within that specified range.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 7.12 (although this is generally applicable to v6.48 and other v7.x versions with minor syntax changes).
*   **Interface:** A bridge interface named `bridge-23` must exist. We'll assume it's already configured, but weâ€™ll cover the bridging basics later.
*   **Functionality:** We need an IP Pool to define a range of IP addresses that can be dynamically assigned via DHCP.
*   **Flexibility:** The solution should be easily adjustable for expanding the pool or modifying subnet masks.
*   **Security:** Secure practices for DHCP and pool management are paramount.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI & Winbox)

### 2.1 CLI Implementation:

   *   **Step 1: Define the IP Pool:**

      ```mikrotik
      /ip pool
      add name=pool-bridge-23 ranges=170.97.128.10-170.97.128.200
      ```

      **Explanation:**
       * `/ip pool add`: This command adds a new IP Pool
       * `name=pool-bridge-23`: Assigns a descriptive name to the pool
       * `ranges=170.97.128.10-170.97.128.200`: Defines the range of IP addresses included in the Pool

   *   **Step 2: Verify the Pool:**
         ```mikrotik
         /ip pool print
         ```
        **Explanation:**
          * `/ip pool print`: Displays all IP pools and their information.

    *   **Step 3: Create DHCP Server Network Configuration:**

        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server network
        add address=170.97.128.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1 gateway=170.97.128.1 netmask=24
        ```

         **Explanation:**
          * `/ip dhcp-server network add`: Creates a new DHCP server network
          * `address=170.97.128.0/24`: Defines the subnet of the DHCP server
          * `dns-server=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1`: Sets the DNS servers to be advertised
          * `gateway=170.97.128.1`: Sets the gateway of the DHCP server network
          * `netmask=24`: The netmask of the DHCP server network

   *   **Step 4:  Create DHCP Server Configuration:**

        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server
        add address-pool=pool-bridge-23 interface=bridge-23 lease-time=10m name=dhcp-server-bridge-23
        ```
      **Explanation:**
          * `/ip dhcp-server add`: Creates a new DHCP Server
          * `address-pool=pool-bridge-23`: Assigns the previously created pool as the source of dynamic IPs
          * `interface=bridge-23`:  Specifies that DHCP is provided via the `bridge-23` interface.
          * `lease-time=10m`: The lease time of the IP addresses
          * `name=dhcp-server-bridge-23`: A descriptive name for the DHCP server

   *   **Step 5: Verify DHCP Server Configuration:**

        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-server print
        ```
         **Explanation:**
           * `/ip dhcp-server print`: Prints all existing DHCP servers.

   *   **Step 6: Verify DHCP Server Network Configuration:**

        ```mikrotik

add address-pool=pool-bridge-23 interface=bridge-23 lease-time=10m name=dhcp-server-bridge-23
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect `ranges` configuration in the IP pool.
    *   **Error Scenario:** If the ranges do not exist or overlap, DHCP will not correctly allocate IP addresses.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Use `/ip pool print` to verify the configured ranges. Check client DHCP leases via `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to see if they match the pool.
*   **Pitfall:**  Using the same pool for multiple DHCP servers on the same interface.
    *   **Error Scenario:** IP conflicts will occur.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Use `/ip dhcp-server print` to identify overlapping pool and interface assignments.
*   **Pitfall:** The interface assigned to the DHCP server does not correspond with an active interface.
    *   **Error Scenario:** DHCP server will be active but there will be no response to DHCP requests.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Verify that the interface specified in `/ip dhcp-server print`  corresponds with an active interface. Check for interface issues via `/interface print`.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect DHCP network configuration
    *   **Error Scenario:** DHCP requests will be handled, but the addresses will not be correct.
    *   **Diagnostic:** Verify the parameters in `/ip dhcp-server network print`. Verify that the subnet, gateway, and dns servers are correctly configured

*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Use `torch` to monitor traffic on the interface for DHCP Discover packets: `/tool torch interface=bridge-23 port=67,68`.
    *   Use the log to check for DHCP server errors: `/system logging print where topics~"dhcp"`
    *   Test from a client device connected to the `bridge-23` network to see if the IP address is leased from the pool.

## 5. Verification and Testing

1.  **Ping Test:** After a device connects to the network, use `ping 170.97.128.1` from that device or from the router itself.
2.  **DHCP Lease Verification:**  On the MikroTik, use `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to view which IPs have been assigned.
3.  **Torch:** Monitor DHCP traffic: `/tool torch interface=bridge-23 port=67,68`.
4.  **Traceroute:** Use traceroute from a device within the network, or from the router itself to verify that routing is correct: `/tool traceroute 8.8.8.8`.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Multiple Pools:** You can create multiple IP pools to assign different address ranges for different purposes or different VLANs.
*   **Pool Sharing:** You can share one or more pools between different DHCP servers for IP address management.
*   **Dynamic Pool Size:** The size of the pool will depend on the defined range.
*   **IP Pool Reservation:** You can reserve an IP address for a specific MAC address within the DHCP server configuration, thus making the IP assignment static. This is done outside of the Pool configuration.
*   **Limitations:** The address pool itself will be confined to the subnet of the IP network that the DHCP server is configured on. The pool range can not be on a different subnet.
*   **Advanced Features:** Combining IP pools with RADIUS for advanced user management is possible.

      }
]
    ```

**Note:** MikroTik's REST API often uses `.id` for unique identifiers. You'll use this to refer to specific configuration elements. The `*` followed by a number is how the MikroTik interface represents internal IDs.

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:**  `bridge-23` is a Layer 2 bridge, which means it forwards traffic based on MAC addresses. It allows multiple physical or virtual interfaces to act as a single Layer 2 network segment. The bridge itself needs an assigned IP address for management (often 170.97.128.1 in the subnet). In a simple case, a bridge can pass DHCP traffic. If VLANs are present, these need to be configured on the bridge as well.
*   **Routing:** While we are not doing any explicit routing in this configuration, itâ€™s vital to have a default route set for the router itself for connectivity to the internet: `/ip route add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.88.1`. Without this the router itself will not have internet access. The IP Address that is assigned to `bridge-23` will be the default gateway of the clients who connect to the network.
*   **DHCP:** DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used to automatically provide IP configuration to clients. In this case, it takes addresses from the defined `pool-bridge-23`, providing address leases with associated configurations to network devices. The DHCP server listens on the configured interface, and responds to DHCP request packets from network clients
*  **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):** In this case we are using IPv4, but MikroTik fully supports IPv6 configurations as well. When defining pools, the syntax is different for IPv6. When IPv6 addresses are assigned, special care should be taken to assign a globally routable address range.
*   **Firewall:** The firewall is not configured in this demonstration, however, it is vital to have a secure firewall configuration for any network. This is implemented using the `/ip firewall` section.

## 9. Security Best Practices

*   **DHCP Snooping (with VLANs):** Implement DHCP snooping on your switches if you're using VLANs to prevent rogue DHCP servers.  This is not applicable in this basic configuration, but it is a best practice.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Have robust firewall rules to protect your router and network. This would include protecting the management plane as well as preventing network access from untrusted sources. This is crucial to prevent outside access to internal devices.
*   **Strong Passwords and Usernames:** Always use strong, unique passwords and limit administrator user access.
*   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update RouterOS to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services (like telnet) that are not needed.
*   **Control Plane Security:** Control Plane security is extremely important. It limits access to the router management interface from untrusted sources.
*   **Log Auditing:** Enable and monitor logs for any suspicious activity. Use `/system logging print` to configure and view log settings.
*   **HTTPS/SSH for Management:** Use secure protocols like HTTPS for Winbox and SSH for CLI access, and only from trusted source IPs.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configurations for MikroTik Topics

Letâ€™s go through detailed explanations of the requested MikroTik topics with a strong focus on how these features are applied in the given scenario. This will be a more general overview, including how the commands relate to the specific example.

###   IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

*   **IPv4:** As used in our example, IP addresses are assigned using CIDR notation (e.g. `170.97.128.0/24`). IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length, and addresses are organized into a network and host portion.
*   **IPv6:** IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length. IPv6 addresses have a far larger number of addresses compared to IPv4, and they support auto-configuration and multicasting. IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal. Configuring IPv6 in RouterOS is very similar to IPv4 and you can use `/ipv6 address` to assign addresses, and `/ipv6 pool` for defining pools. IPv6 support will require enabling IPv6 via `/ipv6 settings set disabled=no`.
*   **Usage:** In our example, we are using IPv4 for simplicity.
###   IP Pools

*   **Function:** IP Pools define ranges of IP addresses, as we demonstrated. They are used by DHCP servers, hotpots, PPP, and other services that need to dynamically allocate IP addresses to clients or interfaces.
*   **CLI:**  Commands such as `/ip pool add`, `/ip pool remove`, and `/ip pool print` are used for creation, deletion, and viewing.
*   **Winbox:** Available under IP > Pools, this provides a graphical interface to manage pools.
*   **Considerations:** Pools need to be defined within the IP subnet that is available, and also within any VLAN that is utilized.
###   IP Routing

*   **Concept:** IP Routing is the process of selecting paths for network traffic. In a MikroTik, routes are created using `/ip route add` (static routes), and dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, and RIP.
*   **Implementation:**  Our example does not make use of explicit static routing, it is done by a default gateway configuration for the DHCP server on a given network.
*   **Importance:** Routing ensures packets reach their destinations by forwarding them through networks. We mentioned this above, but a default route is essential for internet connectivity for a MikroTik router. Without this, traffic will not be able to leave the router.
###  IP Settings

*   **Function:** IP settings allows for defining global IP related settings for the router such as routing-mark based forwarding and whether or not to allow fastpath. Fastpath can significantly improve router performance.
*   **CLI:** `/ip settings print` for viewing current configurations, and `/ip settings set` for changing settings.
*   **Considerations:** When utilizing VPN, setting "allow-fast-path" should be considered in order to provide better performance to tunneled traffic. This will prevent packets from traversing the firewall.
###  MAC Server

*   **Function:** The MAC Server is used for Layer 2 management of devices. This includes MAC address based authorization.
*   **CLI:** The MAC Server is managed with `/mac-server` and `/mac-server service` commands.
*   **Winbox:** MAC Server options are found under Tools > MAC Server
*   **Usage:** This is often used to manage wireless connections. This was not included in our base example as we only used a bridge connection.
###  RoMON

*   **Function:** RoMON (Router Management Overlay Network) allows management and discovery of multiple MikroTik routers in a network. It operates at layer 2 and therefore can bypass many networking issues.
*   **CLI:**  Managed via `/romon` commands.
*   **Winbox:**  RoMON is available under Tools > RoMON.
*   **Usage:** This is generally not useful in a SOHO environment but vital in enterprise settings.
###   WinBox

*   **Function:** WinBox is the primary graphical configuration tool for RouterOS. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing most of the features of a MikroTik router.
*   **Accessibility:** WinBox is available for Windows and MacOS and the application must be downloaded from the MikroTik website.
*   **Alternatives:**  The web interface can also be used for configuration.
###   Certificates

*   **Function:** Certificates are used for authentication and encryption in services such as Web servers, VPN servers, RADIUS and more.
*   **CLI:**  Certificates are managed with `/certificate` and `/certificate generate-csr` commands.
*   **Winbox:** Available in System > Certificates.
*   **Security:** Proper certificate usage ensures the secure transfer of data and secure identification and authorization of resources.
###  PPP AAA

*  **Function:**  PPP AAA is used to manage user authentication using the PPP protocol. PPP is often used by ISPs for internet delivery and VPN technologies.
*  **CLI:** The `/ppp profile`, `/ppp secret`, `/ppp interface`, and other related commands.
*  **Usage:** The PPP protocol is most often used in dial-up, VPN, and some internet services. In this example, the focus was on DHCP based IP assignment.
###  RADIUS

*  **Function:** RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network access. RADIUS can be used for PPPoE, Hotspots, Wireless and other methods.
*  **CLI:** RADIUS configurations are done via `/radius` commands.
*  **Usage:** RADIUS is most useful in environments that require a central authority for authorization. For simple IP address assignment, this is unnecessary.
### User / User groups

*  **Function:** RouterOS allows the creation and management of users and user groups for access to the router itself.
*  **CLI:** Use the `/user` commands for management and configuration.
*  **Winbox:** Accessible via System > Users.
*  **Security:** Important for restricting router access and for providing different access levels for administrators.
###  Bridging and Switching

*  **Function:** Bridging combines interfaces into one single layer 2 domain. Switching is implemented using switch chips on many of MikroTik's products, providing high speed packet forwarding within the same L2 domain.
*  **CLI:** Bridge configuration is done via `/interface bridge` commands. `/interface ethernet switch` commands will control switching configurations on devices that have a switch chip.
*  **Winbox:** Bridge functionality is available in Interfaces > Bridge, and Switch Chip features are configured in Interfaces > Ethernet > Switch
*  **Application:** We used bridging in our base example using the `bridge-23` interface. Bridging is used to provide connectivity between different interface types or to allow for network segment expansion.
###  MACVLAN

*  **Function:** MACVLAN allows the creation of virtual network interfaces based on different MAC addresses on the same physical interface.
*  **CLI:** Managed via `/interface macvlan` commands.
*  **Usage:** Can be useful for creating logical interfaces on a single port. This is not commonly used in a SOHO environment.
###  L3 Hardware Offloading

*   **Function:** L3 Hardware Offloading utilizes hardware capabilities within MikroTik devices, generally on switch chips, to significantly accelerate the forwarding of routed traffic.
*   **CLI:** L3 offloading settings are available within `/interface ethernet switch`
*   **Benefit:** Allows for higher bandwidth and throughput in routed traffic scenarios, especially in larger network deployments.
###  MACsec

*   **Function:** MACsec (Media Access Control Security) provides Layer 2 encryption for point-to-point connections.
*   **CLI:**  MACsec configuration is found in `/interface macsec`.
*   **Usage:**  Useful for providing link-level security between two points that you control.
### Quality of Service

*   **Function:** QoS is utilized to prioritize types of network traffic. This ensures high-priority applications receive sufficient bandwidth while limiting resources from lower priority services.
*   **CLI:** `/queue tree`, `/queue type`, `/queue simple`
*   **Winbox:** QoS is configured via Queues.
*   **Implementation:** QoS policies are complex and require careful consideration for implementation. A simple example is shaping traffic using `/queue simple` where a simple upload or download speed can be applied to a specific IP range.
### Switch Chip Features

*   **Function:** MikroTik devices equipped with switch chips have hardware capabilities to support layer 2 bridging and switching with high performance. This includes VLAN support, port isolation and other features.
*   **CLI:**  Managed via `/interface ethernet switch` command, as mentioned previously.
*   **Performance:** Using the hardware switch is essential for achieving higher throughput within a given layer 2 domain.
### VLAN

*   **Function:** VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) logically separate traffic on the same physical network. Each VLAN functions as a separate network.
*   **CLI:** VLANs are configured using `/interface vlan add` and configured on a bridge with the `vlan-ids` parameter.
*   **Winbox:** VLAN configurations are done in Interfaces > VLAN.
*   **Usage:** Useful for network segmentation and for providing logically separate networks on the same physical infrastructure.
### VXLAN

*   **Function:** VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a tunneling protocol for layer 2 over IP. It allows layer 2 domains to be spanned across layer 3 routed networks.
*   **CLI:** VXLAN configurations are done via `/interface vxlan` commands.
*   **Usage:**  Useful for spanning layer 2 across geographically dispersed locations.
###  Firewall and Quality of Service

*  **Firewall:** MikroTikâ€™s firewall is extremely powerful with advanced layer 7 filtering, routing-mark, and connection tracking. The firewall rules follow a top to bottom process and utilize matchers to filter traffic before applying an action. Firewall rules can be configured in the `/ip firewall filter`, `/ip firewall nat`, `/ip firewall mangle`, `/ip firewall raw` sections
*  **Quality of Service:** As described previously, Quality of service controls the bandwidth and prioritization of network traffic.
*  **Connection Tracking:** Connection tracking allows the firewall to keep state about packets and sessions, allowing complex traffic flows. The use of the `established` matcher depends on connection tracking to work correctly.
*  **Packet Flow:** Packet Flow is complex. The firewall follows this general rule: Raw chain > Mangle chain > Firewall filter chain >  Nat chain > Queues. Mangle chain is called again after NAT.
*  **Kid Control, UPnP, NAT-PMP:** Kid Control is a basic content filtering capability. UPnP is used for automatic port forwarding and NAT-PMP provides similar functionality but is specific to Apple devices. NAT-PMP is considered insecure, so if possible, it should be avoided.
### IP Services (DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy)

*  **DHCP:** As we already covered in our example, DHCP is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients.
*  **DNS:**  RouterOS can act as a DNS server using the `/ip dns` section. It is a caching DNS server which will cache DNS results to improve performance.
*  **SOCKS:**  A SOCKS proxy is a general-purpose proxy that can be used for many different types of traffic. SOCKS configurations are found in the `/ip socks` section.
*  **Proxy:**  A Web Proxy can be implemented for caching website data, and is available in the `/ip proxy` section. This is less relevant for modern network environments.
### High Availability Solutions (Including: Load Balancing, Bonding, Bonding Examples, HA Case Studies, Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group, VRRP, VRRP Configuration Examples)

*  **Load Balancing:** Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple links or servers. MikroTik has multiple methods for achieving this, such as Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP), Per-Connection Classifier (PCC) and more.
*  **Bonding:** Bonding, or link aggregation, combines multiple ethernet links into a single logical link. This can provide increased bandwidth and redundancy.
* **Multi-chassis Link Aggregation Group:** Can be used in more advanced scenarios to aggregate links between multiple routers.
*  **VRRP:** VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) provides a hot-standby solution for network gateways. If one router fails, another router will automatically take over.
*   **HA Case Studies:** Each environment may have different HA requirements. High Availability solutions need to be implemented according to those specific requirements.

### Mobile Networking (Including: GPS, LTE, PPP, SMS, Dual SIM Application)

*   **GPS:** MikroTik devices may support GPS for time synchronization and location services.
*   **LTE:** LTE interfaces on MikroTik routers allows cellular network connectivity. Cellular data settings are configured in the `/interface lte` section.
*  **PPP:** PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is used for dial-up connections, PPPoE (DSL), and some VPN technologies.
*  **SMS:** Some Mikrotik devices support SMS messaging using their cellular interfaces.
*  **Dual SIM:** For devices that support dual sim, two separate LTE interfaces can be managed at once. This allows for more redundancy and failover configurations.

### Multi Protocol Label Switching - MPLS (Including: MPLS Overview, MPLS MTU, Forwarding and Label Bindings, EXP bit and MPLS Queuing, LDP, VPLS, Traffic Eng, MPLS Reference)

*   **MPLS Overview:** MPLS is a routing method that forwards traffic through use of a label. This enables high-performance routing with greater control over the forwarding process.
*   **MPLS MTU:** The maximum transmission unit needs to be taken into account when implementing MPLS to avoid fragmentation. MPLS adds an additional layer to each packet.
*   **Forwarding and Label Bindings:** MPLS forwarding is done by creating label bindings between routers. This needs to be carefully configured to ensure packets arrive at the correct destination.
*  **EXP bit and MPLS Queuing:** The EXP bit is used for QoS and to provide different levels of prioritization for traffic. MPLS queuing can then be used to manage how traffic is handled.
*   **LDP, VPLS, Traffic Eng:** LDP is used for label distribution. VPLS provides layer 2 bridging over a MPLS domain. Traffic Eng is used to provide specific paths for certain types of traffic through the MPLS network.
*   **MPLS Reference:** MikroTikâ€™s documentation serves as a reference for all MPLS related configurations.

###  Network Management (Including: ARP, Cloud, DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy, Openflow)

*  **ARP:** The Address Resolution Protocol maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. ARP entries are used for communications within a single L2 domain.
*  **Cloud:**  MikroTikâ€™s cloud service enables cloud based features, such as remote access through a secure tunnel. Cloud can be configured using `/ip cloud` commands.
*  **DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy:** Described earlier, these are used to provide IP configuration, DNS resolution, and proxy services.
*  **Openflow:** Openflow provides centralized management over the network using flow based routing. Openflow is managed using `/openflow` commands.

### Routing (Including: Routing Protocol Overview, Moving from ROSv6 to v7 with examples, Routing Protocol Multi-core Support, Policy Routing, Virtual Routing and Forwarding - VRF, OSPF, RIP, BGP, RPKI, Route Selection and Filters, Multicast, Routing Debugging Tools, Routing Reference, BFD, IS-IS)

*  **Routing Protocol Overview:**  Routing Protocols (such as OSPF, RIP, BGP, etc.) allow for dynamic exchange of routing information between routers. This provides scalability and redundancy.
*  **Moving from ROSv6 to v7:** RouterOS v7 features a redesigned routing stack which supports multicore processing, better performance, and new features. The routing protocol configurations have changed in certain ways, especially with respect to the way filters are implemented and the way that instances are configured.
*  **Routing Protocol Multi-core Support:** Routing protocols utilize multi-core processors in v7 to provide better throughput and more efficient CPU resource utilization.
* **Policy Routing:** Policy based routing (PBR) is a method to forward packets based on more advanced criteria such as source IP address, or other parameters. PBR configurations are found in the `/ip route rule` section.
*   **Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF):** VRF separates routing tables within a router. This is useful to create unique and separate logical routing domains that can exist on the same router. VRF configurations are found in the `/routing vrf` section.
*   **OSPF, RIP, BGP:** These are commonly used dynamic routing protocols that allow routers to automatically learn about network changes.
*   **RPKI:** RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) is used for securing routing information in BGP and is configured in the `/routing bgp rpkivalidator` section.
*  **Route Selection and Filters:** Route Selection is the process of selecting the best path to take when multiple paths exist. Route filters can limit and manipulate routing information exchanged using these dynamic protocols. Route filters are implemented via route filters for each protocol (i.e. `/routing ospf filter`).
*  **Multicast:** Multicast routing protocols send data to multiple subscribers in a group and is configured in the `/routing multicast` section.
*   **Routing Debugging Tools:** MikroTik has debugging tools such as `torch` , `traceroute`, and `/routing print`  to help with diagnosing routing issues.
*  **BFD, IS-IS:** BFD provides fast detection of link failures. IS-IS is a link state routing protocol.

### System Information and Utilities (Including: Clock, Device-mode, E-mail, Fetch, Files, Identity, Interface Lists, Neighbor discovery, Note, NTP, Partitions, Precision Time Protocol, Scheduler, Services, TFTP)

*  **Clock:** Clock settings are managed in the `/system clock` section to manage date, time and timezone.
*  **Device-mode:** Device mode is used to set different functions for routeros, such as switching mode or routing mode. This is generally found in the `/system routerboard settings` section.
*  **E-mail:** RouterOS supports sending emails for notifications and logging using the `/system email` configuration.
*  **Fetch:** The `fetch` utility in RouterOS allows fetching of files from remote locations using HTTP, FTP and other methods.
*  **Files:** The `/file` command allows file manipulation, viewing and other functions.
*  **Identity:**  Set the name of your router with the `/system identity` setting.
*  **Interface Lists:** Interface lists allow for grouping of interfaces, making firewall rules and other configuration easier. This is managed using the `/interface list` commands.
*  **Neighbor discovery:** RouterOS discovers neighboring devices via protocols such as CDP, LLDP and MikroTikâ€™s neighbor discovery via `/ip neighbor` commands.
* **Note:** The `/system note` command allows for adding a note to the system configuration.
*  **NTP:** NTP (Network Time Protocol) is managed in the `/system ntp` section, enabling time synchronization.
*  **Partitions:** The routerOS drive can be configured in `/system disk` where multiple partitions can be defined.
*  **Precision Time Protocol:** PTP provides high-precision time synchronization and can be managed in the `/system ptp` section.
*   **Scheduler:** Scheduler creates scheduled jobs for configuration automation, and can be managed using `/system scheduler` commands.
*   **Services:** Services on the device are managed in the `/ip services` section, and specific ports and protocols for router access can be defined here.
*  **TFTP:** TFTP is a basic protocol for transferring files and is managed using `/ip tftp` commands.
