To be clear — IDK why the forum was getting 500 errors / hanging — I more was trying to make a joke.  Now, I did see the active users being 1500 or so - but that does not mean there was an "attack" per se.But it be nice if Mikrotik posted the post-mortem  on the failure, since it might a learning experience for everyone.

A spike in session counts is usually a good indicator of a DDoS attack.Yup.I'd like to think it's still possible to self-host a 25 year old "web app" (phpBB here).  i.e. without needing cloud services (AWS, cloudflare, Azure, etc.) or expensive enterprise security products.  Perhaps not — that why I'd be curious about at "root cause" here from Mikrotik, perhaps be a good YouTube video.

These “legal” index bots don’t cause spikes in guest session counts, so it’s most likely a DDoS attack going on.EDIT: I still occasionally get “500 Internal Server Error.”

But I always block all search bot and never had an issue with max session limit hit. And yes even Google misbehaves at times.It’s extremely rare nowadays for big companies using index bots to misbehave. If there’s a problem, it’s usually a misconfiguration on your end. Also, legal index bots don’t use anonymous access.If you allow anonymous access, spikes in guest session counts are almost always a pretty reliable indicator of a DDoS attack.EDIT:The guest session counts are currently at 1651, so I’m guessing the botnet driver has ramped up the pace. This is a battle Mikrotik won’t win unless they take some serious action.

MT should just build a new forum web site and use Apache or nginx.They are already using nginx (it doesn't make any difference anyway). And no, they should not build a new forum. phpBB is perfectly fine.

I wonder if related to two submerged sea comm cables getting cut, I  read about in the news.I doubt it. Got having those "bad gateway" errors, between their nginx HTTP server facing the web and the backend. I'd say it's a good and old ddos - either intentional or a byproduct of bad coded crawler.

Haha!Either way, it really doesn’t matter how it’s done, the pikes in guest session count clearly points to a classic DDoS attack (IMO)It’ll be interesting to see who holds out the longest in this battle, MT or the DDoS drivers. This kind of volume is pretty cheap to buy on the dark web. ￼

Ah. This we agree upon: it's past time they shove it behind some Cloudfare or whatnot.+1Not be the contritaian.  Why should some cloud solution be needed?I'm pretty sure Mikrotik can fix this without 3rd parties.  Maybe not.  But Mikrotik's basic product pitch is nothing depends on the cloud.And I've seen a recent trends to promotingself-hosting to avoid cloud costs, so the forum kinda curious test of that theory.i.e.to host a server for a few thousand users on BGP connected AS, without needing cloudflare.


---
### Author: Tue Nov 19, 2024 11:16 pm

Not be the contritaian.  Why should some cloud solution be needed?Because this is not their core business. Their routers aren't the best bet to fend off heavy DDOSs - and they shouldn't: it isn't their market target. It's akin to asking Amazon why they are hiring heavy haulers to do the inventory transport. It isn't their core business.

Their routers aren't the best bet to fend off heavy DDOSs - and they shouldn't: it isn't their market target.IDK, maybe it should be.  I just don't buy that every publicly visible site needs to use hosted cloud services.  If a company that makes high performance routers cannot secure a simple ~LAMP app... that would be telling.Personally, I'd like to see the forum run as containers on Mikrotik hardware (or, maybe Ampere).  Microsoft always used to drag out MS's IT department when pitching new services to their customers, with their lessons learned.  So if Mikrotik had to run production containers using their own features, maybe /container get more fixes.

If you need serious DDoS protection as a front-end service, it takes massive computing resources, expert skills, and experience.Normally, IMO that’s not something a company like MT could manage on-premise by themselves.

### Author: Tue Nov 19, 2024 11:38 pm

Maybe it's time to start using Cloudflare?By the way a website hosted in Latvia shouldn't have 320ms+ latency from Poland...

```
Code:Select all--- forum.mikrotik.com ping statistics ---
141177 packets transmitted, 139046 packets received, 1.5% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 53.201/237.958/1503.411/128.193 ms
```

I guess I'm saying Mikrotik runs VPN proxy (BTH) and /ip/cloud DDNS already.  So some PHP should actually be easier than BTH to secure.....and why I present the question.As a data point, I ran a ping over the weekend, it was ~250ms from the west coast to Mikrotik/Lativia, with 1.5% packet loss – which is similar to what I've seen in past.

IDK, maybe it should be.  I just don't buy that every publicly visible site needs to use hosted cloud services.  If a company that makes high performance routers cannot secure a simple ~LAMP app... that would be telling.It COULD be. But the need of something able to fend off heavy ddos attacks and what Mikrotik sells today... it's several degrees of separation. I mean, I love Mikrotik hardware - but they have their limits, and it's OK: no one can be a jack of all trades.By Mikrotik to route.By something else to mitigate huge ddos.Buy a third vendor to cattle for your HTTP needs.Why should someone be the "do all and be all"? It's elephants all the way down!

### Author: Wed Nov 20, 2024 12:21 am

Why do you all think that this is/was some sort of attack?Because the number of connected - and anonymous - users just keeps getting up until the forum crashes. Yes, we could be dealing of one (several?) bad written crawlers. But I don't know... more and more it looks to me as some kind of attack.


---
### Author: Wed Nov 20, 2024 3:23 am
Date: Unknown

IDK, maybe it should be.It COULD be.I wasn't trying to argue – not wrong from a pure business perspective hosting might make more sense, especially if uptime and low-latency were a concern....But for Mikrotik it would be a sign of capitulation.  And implication that any small/medium sized business should not self-host things like a public web site.  IDK the right answer, given all threats.  That being said... being dependent on a cloud provider has different risks too.Anyway, I'd be curious on the hearing the root cause from Mikrotik...

Anyway, I'd be curious on the hearing the root cause from Mikrotik...Won´t be all?I still think it's a matter of focus. No one complains to the Tyre maker when the ring has problems.No one think it's weird when a ring is damaged by bad roads.I think it's the same thing: Mikrotik does routers, not DDOSs mitigation equipment.Try the reverse: how many DDOSs equipment makers are geared through a simple routing algorithm?

We have disabled the search robots, except biggest ones, but the attacks are regular DDoS attacks going to different IP every time. We are trying to optimize the forum servers to handle bigger loads, but the attacks keep getting bigger too. Since PHPBB is old software, another option would be to migrate to other forum software that supports load balancing, high availibility etc. But I also know many forum users would not like it.

That’s it. If everything’s ready, it’ll only take you 5-10 minutes tops.Ps.. Pro tip: forget about reboots and focus on addressing the root cause instead.Or use cloudflare in between WWW and server.Yup, that is the way!No, just a better firewall.Cloudflare is a DDoS firewall!

Now would be a good time to check the logs for user agents.

But one is for sure: you cant beat or optimize anything out of phpbb legacy (other than throwing tons of hardware on it)Yup, that's how it is!Even if MT throw a bunch of new powerfull hardware at it, I’m pretty sure the DDoS operator will just spin up a few more threads. Like I said, DDoS bots are dirt cheap to rent, especially for small-scale attacks like the ones hitting this forum.

Your suggestion might very well work, but it could end up being like robbing Peter to pay Paul.Perhaps. But if you're a guest... "user control panel" (aka /ucp.php) is an odd choice to see as the "Now viewing" page in the list of users.  And I'm guessing /ucp.php has a higher load on the backend SQL, than viewing forum pages.Mainly pointing out that NGNIX has logging, so presumably there was some pattern to the attack....

Noting that despite a range of dozens potential solutions (AWS, Azure, Cisco, PaloAlto, etc etc etc) to the DoS problem... the community seems align on Cloudflare as solution.  That says something.

Noting that despite a range of dozens potential solutions (AWS, Azure, Cisco, PaloAlto, etc etc etc) to the DoS problem... the community seems align on Cloudflare as solution.  That says something.I've used Cloudflare for the last four years for most of my sites (for free, BTW) and it's been great.  I don't have any properties that get the volume of traffic that MikroTik gets, but I do have a video streaming app I built that peaks at around 1000-2000 users every six months. On the free tier, there are limits on the amount of bandwidth one can use, but I don't think cost is MT's concern as much as control over DNS is.  (As for me, I like not having to run/manage DNS servers anymore.  Did that and email for 15-20 years...)When COVID policies limited who could go to church, I put together a broadcasting solution for a couple dozen of our local congregations. Written in node.js, it uses web sockets to handle playback control and telemetry.  Without Cloudflare, the app control server struggled with the WSS load at around 100 users. With Cloudflare, the WSS hits are smoothed out and the system can handle 1000+ users simultaneously.

Cloudflare or bust!@anav, I thought you'd like that pivotAnd California be happy to take the tax revenue from Cloudflare.And, @wfburton isn't wrong RouterOS is pretty far from a "enterprise firewall".  Installing Cloudflare's single exe tunnel in a NPK, with some UI/CLI for some of the common services seems like a simpler path to filling in the gap between RouterOS vs getting into being a security product themselves (which is hard, since new threats evolve daily...).

MikroTik and CloudFlare business relationship would be a good idea.  Even on a limited level with ClouldFlare Free plain.  It would be a start.Would require open minds and forward thinking business planning!   Will see if both exist.

The various web-scanners from AI companies are getting even more aggressive than before, to the point articles start to be written about it causing four-five digits of extra fees from hosting companies to to the scanned website owners for all the bandwidth used.The stuff seems to be slapped together in the most lazy/basic ways, without any "I've been here already" tracking. (Not to mention ignoring the robots.txt rules asking them to stay away.)One old forum server I host was also hit hard, the webserver handled the load but I've started to get alerts because the (ancient) statistics software was taking so long to parse the hourly accesslog (which was growing to hundreds of MBs) it overlapped into the next hour, triggering a cronjob error.In the log it was basically obvious the crawler in question was digging through /all/ of the forum posts over and over from the beginning, from many IPs in parallel.So yeah, literal definition of a DDoS but not necessarily as a targetted attack. I wouldn't be surprised if something like this is happening here as well.

I believe MikroTik could benefit from professional support or consulting regarding the operation and hosting of a web application. There have already been some suggestions in this regard. The forum is experiencing HTTP 500 errors almost daily.2025-01-14_11-22.pngThere is a typo: it should be "later" instead of "latter".

A load balancer like haproxy as a single measure wont improve the situation significantly. Worst case it would introduce all kind of other issues other than HTTP 500 we currently see - if done badly.I have no experience with phpbb itself, but from a quick google research it seems to have a redis cache driver. To have a shared cache instance is basically first requirement to balance at all.It is unknown to us to which degree this phpbb instance is optimized at all.Most probably some kind of fine grained rate limiting could already do a good job - without the need for fancy pants SaaS solutions like cloudflare.we dont know what, which kind or how many of requests are taking down the forum after all. We are only speculating. So it is hard to tell where the bottleneck is located.

So it is hard to tell where the bottleneck is located.Was more about normis stating that you can't load balance phpbb.As for files there could also be 2 really dirty solutions:1. Just don't care about it for users not logged in (as they can't see attachments anyway) and only load balance those2. Use a shared volumeAnd yes we don't know what the problem load is other than it seems somewhere between 500 - 5000 phpbb sessionsAs most people on here were saying "use cloudflare" and mikrotik seems to be against it, it could be another solution.(I did include a rate limit in my quick haproxy mockup)As others have stated as well. It leaves a bad feeling about mikrotik cloud services.

How aboutRate Limiting with Nginx? Works well for a customer's Java web application to restrain the crawler bots.

### Author: Wed Jan 15, 2025 10:52 am

When we do rate limiting, you users will also be limited. All connections come from random IP addresses. When there are thousands of connections coming in at once, either the servers get overloaded, or there is some cloudflare "read only because this is a cached site" page, either way, forum will not be fully operational when this happens.

How aboutRate Limiting with Nginx? Works well for a customer's Java web application to restrain the crawler bots.Well crawlers aren't ddos attacks.My customers run haproxy with a connection limit.Which means once that is reached new connections will join a queue. (Until the users browser times out)Webserver doesn't get overloaded but users do get affected.So it can happen that it's not fully usable for everyone.When we do rate limiting, you users will also be limited. All connections come from random IP addresses. When there are thousands of connections coming in at once, either the servers get overloaded, or there is some cloudflare "read only because this is a cached site" page, either way, forum will not be fully operational when this happens.If you rate limit the affected urls (I think someone was talking about ucp.php before) then it should slow down the attack and barely affect real users.But in the end we all know they will just look for a new url.Maybe shadowban the IP/url combo? So the user will just access a static version of the page (cloudflares cached message)There's many more possibilities but since none of us know the real vector of attack we can just assumeEDIT:Btw another idea would be to just slow down connections that hit the rate limit.And the problem should be getting less common

Assuming that more than one request comes from each unique IP, implementing rate limits can at least help mitigate the issue. It would require someone with a strong dislike for MikroTik and control over an entire ASN to send, for example, 5000 requests using 5000 unique IPs.

And the typical TCP client in that scenario is a zombie in a botnet that has no traceable relationship to the person who orchestrates the attack, so an AS is totally irrelevant here. I can e.g. imagine a bad guy enjoying using/tool fetchon an zombie army of never upgraded Mikrotik routers to DDoS a Mikrotik forum.
