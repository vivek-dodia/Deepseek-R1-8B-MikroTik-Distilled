Just a nice to have...With WiFi 6  / ax having barely been introduced into Mikrotik harware lineup as of this  general message. I read Wi-Fi 7 is not far off.Further reading I see Mikrotik's favorite supplier Qualcomm is now producing chips with Wi-Fi 7 onboard. ( IPQ9574 / PQ9554 / etc etc)Would it not be great to see MT get on the front foot and start implementing some of these chips into upcoming products( even if RoS is not ready just yet ). And I would think ideally into MT's ceiling mounted gear 1st up(CaP AC/ Cap XL  etc)..wifi 7.pngCPU – Quad-core Arm Cortex-A73 @ 2.2 GHzSystem Memory – DDR3L, DDR4 16/32-bitStorage –  eMMC, NAND, Serial NOR, SD/eMMCNetworkingWired – 6 Port Integrated Ethernet Switch 4 x 2.5 GbE + 5 GbE + 10 GbEWirelessWi-Fi StandardsWi-Fi 7 (802.11be), Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax),Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac), Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), 802.11a/b/gWi-Fi Spectral Bands – 6GHz, 5GHz, 2.4GHzSpatial Streams – 16 streamsChannel Support – 320MHz, 249MHz, 160MHz, 80MHz, 40MHz, 20MHzPeak Speed – 33 Gbps PHY rate, up to 10+ Gbps PHY rate per channelWi-Fi FeaturesSimultaneous & Alternating Multi Link Puncturing for wideband operation in presence of 5G/DFS & 6G/AFC interferers4K QAMUL/DL OFDMA up to 37 users per channelUL/DL MU-MIMO, up to 8 users per channelSustained throughput for up to 2000 usersTxBF, 802.11be QoSWi-Fi Security SuiteWPA3 Personal, WPA3 Enterprise, WPA3 Enhanced Open, WPA3 Easy Connect, WPA2, WPS, 802.11i securityAES-CCMP, AES-GCMP, PRNG, TKIP, WAPI2, WAPI1, WEPPlatform Extensions – Bluetooth, 802.15.4 (Zigbee/Thread), 4G/5G FWAPacket Processing – WAN tunnel offload engine, integrated Ethernet switch, enhanced security processor, high-performance QoS/TMPeripheralsAudio – I2SUSB – USB 3.0I2C, SDIO, SPI, UART4x PCIe 3.0 controllers2x USXGMII (Universal Serial 10GE Media Independent Interface), 1x USXGMII-MProcess Technology – 14nmhttps://www.qualcomm.com/products/appli ... oduct-list"Qualcomm says the new WiFi 7 Networking Pro SoCs can run Openwrt with Linux Kernel 5.4.

For me in that tabel the 6GHz is the most interesting improvement, as there is more interfering 5GHz around us already. Wifi 6E , but probably need Wifi 7 to implement 6GHz properly.The other things are more incremental gains, that will need undisturbed signal for those high MCS encoding, IMHO.

I seriously doubt that Mikrotik will come out with a "WiFi 7" product in less than 2 or 3 years from now.It also looks like Mikrotik totally missed the "Wi-Fi 6e" market.Some (non-Mikrotik)WiFi 7 , Wi-Fi 7 products are shipping right now.IMO , Mikrotik has great reliable wireless products for Wi-Fi 5 products but hardly anything for Wi-Fi 6.  I've been waiting for years for Mikrotik to make a product that operates in the 6 GHz to low 7-GHz bands.

Will we ever get a decent MU-MIMO and OFDMA?New standards are just broader channels and more chains to show more numbers on the paper. 4-8-16 chains give a lot of throughput but have anyone seen a wireless client with more than 2*2 MIMO?I hardly believe that one can't find a free 5GHz channel indoors. Is it so important to have 6-7GHz?MU-MIMO is not working so what is the different?Just a broader channel and higher potential MCS (u hardly get)

Of all the new bells and whistles coming with WiF7, I'm most optimistic about MU-MIMO because it mostly relies on AP's capabilities and it isn't impossible to build AP with large array of antennae (which will make AP huge or ugly or both). But that doesn't increase speed for clients when there's only very few active at a time (i.e. in typical SOHO case). So the benefit of it will only be there for large commercial installations.The rest of features are, as already written, harder to achieve and it's quite likely that we'll see even larger discrepancy between theoretical capacity and reality.

yeah...  320mhz @ 4096qam with an 16x16 array....the baseband/DSP alone will burn a lot of power...the only "good" thing about "wifi7" is the "MU" part, and maybe some improvements to how OFDMA works.the laws of physics will keep us closer to 40mhz@2x2 streams for most applications.i would rather have working wave2+capsman for the existing AX line and CapAC.That will have some real impact in real scenarios, with real phones that real people have from the last 5+ yearswould make a lot more people happy that way (let the half a dozen wifi{next} enthusiasts suffer with tplink for a while)

The cAP AC XL that was released in 2022 is Wifi ACv1 with no upgrade path.So 2014 radio standard... 8 years later.The audience wifi wave2 driver would bring it to ACv2. A 2016 standard. Which they are just getting into caps-man in 2023... 7 years late.Outside of the 60Ghz PtP line... It's pretty hard to take Mikrotik WiFi seriously anymore.

Looking at some of the MT YT videos, and the consumer products line upI come to conclusion that MT is targeting products that "wider public/consumers"will buy, rather then creating "latest" products .......Or, as it's evident from the YT videos, operators or large ISP's in bulkat least for "consumer grade products (SOHO)".I could be wrong ....

Maybe it's time for cAP be...https://eu.store.ui.com/eu/en/products/u7-proThe U7 Pro will have even more issues than its predecessor since on the 6 GHz bandclient devices' maximum allowed EIRP will be lower than access points'therefore APs need higher gain antenna for the 6 GHz band than for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in order to maintain their RCPI advantage over mobile client devices.

... client devices' maximum allowed EIRP will be lower than access points' therefore APs need higher gain antenna for the 6 GHz band ...Tx power asymmetry can not be "rectified" by antenna gain (because it works for both Tx and Rx), this kind of asymmetry can only be "rectified" by asymmetry of Rx sensitivity ... which means that APs will need Rx higher sensitivity than stations. And the difference in Tx power between AP and station is only 6dB. This is way less than difference in Tx power between base station and terminal in mobile networks, in LTE difference is usually somewhere around 20dB (terminals are limited to 23dBm and base stations usually operate at around 40dBm to 46dBm, at least on low and medium frequency bands, i.e. lower than 2.5GHz).Alas, higher Rx sensitivity means that prices of AP chipsets will go up considerably ... perhaps by around 6dB as well.

No longer requiring legacy customers to trash the units to move on.I rescind my earlier statement about "2014 wireless in 2023."We now have 2016 wireless in 2024!

With the proliferation of low-cost Intel BE cards for end-user devices on the market and equipment already available from major competitors - the EAP770 line, UniFi U7 Pro, with the U7 Pro retailing for $189 - it might make it more transparent for many people whether to wait for Mikrotik or buy what is already on the market.Also,https://www.androidpolice.com/wifi-7-phones-list/

While idea is good, all 10G ports and SFP+ in that form factor ? I don't think it's possible. Maybe if they put SFP+ on the side. Also with all 10G ports there is a issue with cooling. I don't think it's possible without active cooling.

This is what these Chateaus makes expensive: their modems. You can expect which speeds on LTE/5G in real world? And with these tremendous speeds 5G/LTE offer it makes no sense to have an SFP port. It makes even no sense to have more than 2.5g ports. And again: Mikrotik develops these Chateau for ISP like the Latvian LMT as I recall. Consumers put it on a desk beside a power socket and it works. It is about needs and costs. They sell the hardware individually as well.When there is need for fiber, then ISP gives you another device. Or you just don't buy Chateau.

But even then, Chateau with a 2.5G or  SFP+ port would be great for businesses who get multigig (>1Gbps) from fiber or wireless (Wave, Tachyon, future vendor) but also need/want an LTE/5G backup.

The problem with roadmaps is that after you publish dates, you damn well stick to them. My impression is that MT has hard time when negotiating with manufacturers of MT's designs (because, let's face it, MT is a small vendor compared to some other well known low-end brands). And it might be that MT's development teams can't stick to some deadlines as well. So MT as a company have to act in a flexible way when it comes to production and product launches. Hence their habit of surprising us.Sometimes a close look at beta packages gives some hints about what they are working on (or perhaps they are more wary not to reveal such things to us lately), but the information is mostly vague (e.g. we might see new SoC type mentioned, but it doesn't tell us what kind of device that will be ... or we see some commercial device names but we can only guess their functionality and/or performance levels).So ... relax, seat back and let them surprise youAnd don't hold your breathe while waiting for a new product to appear, it may take longer than you can live without breathing

And it might be that MT's development teams can't stick to some deadlines as well.Well, we can always look at the big corporations. For example, in the software (as well as gaming) industry, you can simply announce something with a estimated year of release.  If Mikrotik agreed to at least that... Customers would be able to plan the lifecycle of their LAN or WAN equipment.The way it is happening now - looks like complete crap and disrespect for their customers.To give you an example, we're thinking about migrating from 802.11ac to new access points right now. Last year was a good year, we were given a good budget, and most of our work equipment, including employee laptops at the branch offices, have already been upgraded to support at least Wi-Fi 6. In  our country (where the head office is located) 6Ghz spectrum is allowed, so we are considering migration either to 6E or straight to Wi-Fi 7, which is still under discussion. Accordingly, I have to solve the issue of planning - either we move the entire corporation to mikrotik access points, or we change the infrastructure and migrate to another vendor with a more adequate attitude to the customer. We are not big as Coca-Cola or Google, but we have about 12.000 employees in 11 countries...And yes, we use a Mikrotik. No, we don't use Mikrotik as core routers (I want to sleep well at nightand we still use DMVPN...)P.S. If they hadn't fixed the wireless drivers, migration wouldn't have been an issue - we would have definitely migrated to another vendor's hardware.

I agree that there should be a bit of a road-map from Mikrotik, at least in terms of "a product that will.... and has a form factor of ....", because honestly they need to start concentrating on larger customers who as stated by avacha do have large budgets and do lifecycle planning. I also fall a bit into that category of getting a budget to work against, and honestly its getting real hard to justify Mikrotik in core/edge switch gear & wireless to some extent( especially busted drivers in new qcom-ac not working in capsman doing vlans), MT routers thou are generally ok(CCR). I do get a lot of pushback to just put in Cisco gear and be done with it. Its a tough life !It probably wont hurt the bottom line of MT to increase ram/flash storage of future products too so they can jam in a larger OS's( RoS v8+ ), so they don't have to compromise on deliverable features.Anyhow its a wait and see thing as per usual with MT's wireless side of the house. I only hope they have 1 capsman to rule them all in future products, not this broken wifi/wireless 'crap' that has been thrust onto us poor souls who have to manage a large mix of AX + legacy ac2 gear.

Poor souls is the right wording.It is quite sure that Mikrotik is working on some Mediathek based devices. We don't know what kind these devices will be. I would guess wifi7 APs. But who knows.I don't even know why is so top secret.there are only 2 options: wifi7 devices come or not come.a) "we are in development and may release 2025"b) "we focus on AX gear and currently no wifi7 in the making"For b) this would make things clear. People could spend their wifi7 budgets on other vendors and done.On the other hand: every new Mikrotik product or development even when public, needs at least some time for stabilization. Look how it went with ROS7, wifi wave2, Winbox 4. Even when it landed, it will most probably be far from production ready. my 2 cents

Maybe its time MT splits their product lines, and does a 'budget' version of their gear( which I understand reasons for ), and a PRO line of gear ( happy to pay more to have all the bells and whistles.)

Would make sense. Especially for the European market. Labour is very expensive. An European company can make a simple equation: "pay some more $$$ for hardware but get all the bells and whistles or save some bucks on hardware but spend $$$$$ IT admins for hours of hours for troubleshooting capsman"

I wonder if RoS v8, or a Kernel update( e.g v6.4+ ) will help assist with Wi-Fi 7.E.g :https://www.phoronix.com/search/WiFi+7

I don't think so. Support in kernel is IMHO mostly relevant for consumer PCs. Embedded devices and even Android smartphones often use very "old" Kernel versions with many patches applied. And SOC vendors like Qualcomm provide their own driver SDK as well.

Its been another month, still eager to see some news here.I see they announced a refresh of the model I'd love to have WiFi 7 (6ghz support) in for shop floor industrial machines with ethernet ports that get moved around when the floor is reconfigured for new product runs.  They refreshed the wAP ac LTE kit, yes, rounding out the end of 2024 and they released a hardware refresh with an 802.11AC WiFi chipset

Would like to see something like hap ax2, but wifi 7 and with USB port.Yes, I would also like an SFP+ cage for my PON ONT, 2.5G Ethernet interfaces and get this Homeplug AV2 1300 standard back for CPL meshing over powerline option in a USB-C power supply option!Rock.

Mikrotik has a serious problem with its product development timelines. This has been happening since the WiFi 5 lines, but especially since WiFi 6. For years, all manufacturers released complete WiFi 6 product lines while Mikrotik had nothing. When they finally started to release something, they didn’t introduce a complete line (indoor and outdoor APs, desktop devices, etc.). Instead, they started releasing products little by little: first desktop devices, then a month later an indoor AP... years later, an outdoor one. By the time they completed their WiFi 6 line, practically all manufacturers were already releasing their WiFi 7 product lines. Knowing Mikrotik, I don’t expect to see the first WiFi 7 products until at least late 2025 or 2026... not to mention when they will complete the line. This makes it impossible to think of Mikrotik as a serious provider of WiFi solutions. As of today, you cannot offer a reasonably serious client a solution that is not at least WiFi 6-based. Until recently, there were no outdoor WiFi 6 antenna options from Mikrotik, which forced us to look for solutions from other manufacturers... inevitably leading to a loss of customers to other platforms out of sheer necessity. It's clear that Mikrotik has very solid solutions when it comes to routing, but we cannot deny that other platforms have them too, and they offer the possibility of implementing an integrated network with all their equipment from the same manufacturer, something that with Mikrotik becomes, at the very least, complicated, especially during periods of technological change.

MikroTik has definitely fallen behind, that much is clear. The real question is whether they can catch up. But without a solid roadmap, not even a letter to Santa is going to help them here.

The world is moving fast, and companies are making significant investments. It's not just about a handful of devices; we're talking about hundreds of APs being purchased and deployed, sometimes some more to have spare parts. These are investments planned for years ahead. If another vendor is chosen, MikroTik could be waiting years before they even become a theoretical option in the next purchasing cycle. But by then, Wi-Fi 9 could be the standard, and MikroTik might only have a Wi-Fi 7 lineup. Falling behind like this is not a sustainable business strategy for them in the long run.

We ask for WiFi 7, and in the October newsletter we get another Wi-Fi 6 product in the wAP ax.  Insert facepalm emoji here.

Although with wan throughput effectively capped at about  1.1 gigs, the 2.5 has limited utility.

No news isn't good news...  Are we going to have to wait for ROS 8.X with Linux kernel 6.5+ to get good 802.11be support?

For 802.1be a.k.a wifi7 we need ROS v.8 with linux kernel 6+Well according to a previous poster Qualcomm driver supports Kernel 5.4+ and according to the banana pi docs the corresponding MediaTek one does too. (there are rumors about MediaTek Wi-Fi drivers being tested)https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4Since ROS7 is using Kernel 5.6.3 that should work out alright.https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... nelversion
