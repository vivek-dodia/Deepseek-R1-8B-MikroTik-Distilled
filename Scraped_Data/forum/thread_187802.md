Hi to All,I've updated the main router in my school this week from the 6.x to last 7.x version (7.4) and I've started noticing some problem that I haven't noticed in my lab environment:I'm using from many years the "reply-only" arp option on the interfaces of the laboratories of my school, to increase the security, assigning all the ips from the mikrotik's dhcp (static leases), and with the 6.x version, and previous versions, have ever worked perfectly.Now the "reply-only" option seam still working, but I've some problem on the arp table: many of the record of the table from those interfaces are marked as invalid, like this one:mikrotik_arp_problem_example.pngI've tried deleting one of those invalid records from the arp table and made the computer to do a new dhcp request. I can see the leases on the dhcp server that is bound, but nothing appear on the arp table for that device.I've double checked in the dhcp server configuration and the "Add ARP for leases" option is flagged.Here's are part of the configuration of one of the interfaces and the relative dhcp server:Code:Select all/interfacevlanaddarp=reply-onlyinterface="LAN (sfp-sfpplus2)"name="lab_6 (24)"vlan-id=24/ip dhcp-serveraddadd-arp=yes authoritative=after-2sec-delayinterface="lab_6 (24)"\

I also had the same problem on version 7.9 when I turned on Reply-only ARP, then the Hotspot login page didn't work, I checked the ARP table and it said Invalid

Issue still there in 7.11Anyone have it running in 7.x ? Can't mikrotik fix this ?

Didn't see anything related in 7.12RC changelog...so should still be there in 7.12

Had the similar problem with 7.12.1 on RB952Ui (MIPSBE) but not C53UiG (arm64). The reboot fixed invalid static entries, as they became valid.SUP-137777 (cool number)

Still the same with 7.13

Same on 7.13.1Except this time the ARP record remains invalid even after a reboot. To get this fixed I had to remove and re-add the entry. Rebooted after each action, for good measure.

Smooth upgrade from 7.13.1 to 7.13.2: the static ARP record was not marked as invalid. Fixed?

For me, the problem seems to occur immediately after the hotspot user appears in the active list. As a workaround, disabling the ARP entry and then enabling it using the following hotspot user-profiles On-Login script has solved the problem for now.Code:Select all:localarplist[/ip arp findwheredisabled=no]:foreachiin=$arplistdo={if([/ip arpget$i address]=$address)do={/ip arp disable $i/ip arp enable $i}}To add the script to all Hotspot users (removes current On-Login scripts):Code:Select allupdated below

The above script works only for static ARP entries. A workaround for dynamic entries is to disable and enable add-arp-for-leases on the DHCP server.Here is a script that works for both (removes current On-Login scripts):Code:Select all/ip hotspot user profileset[find]on-login="Fix_arp_schedule"/system scriptadddont-require-permissions=noname=Fix_arpowner=admin policy=\
    ftp,reboot,read,write,policy,test,password,sniff,sensitive,romon source=":lo\
    cal darplist [/ip arp find where invalid=yes and dynamic=yes]\r\
    \nif ( [:len \$darplist] > 0 ) do={ \r\
    \n:log info [:len \$darplist]\r\
    \n:local dlist [/ip dhcp-server find where add-arp=yes and disabled=no]; \r\
    \n/ip dhcp-server set \$dlist add-arp=no; \r\
    \n/ip dhcp-server set \$dlist add-arp=yes; }\r\

The 7.13.2 -> 7.13.3 upgrade broke the ARP record, it's "invalid" upon the first boot. Had to delete the record, reboot, and add then re-add it.
