Okay, let's dive into a detailed configuration of a MikroTik MAC server within a Hotspot network, focusing on RouterOS 7.11 (with notes for compatibility with 6.48 and 7.x). This configuration is aimed at an expert level, assuming you understand basic networking and RouterOS concepts.

## Scenario Description:

We're setting up a MAC server on a MikroTik router, specifically on interface `vlan-78` (which we assume is a VLAN interface already configured and associated with a subnet `61.24.147.0/24`). This MAC server will respond to MAC address discovery requests within the specified VLAN. This is especially useful in a hotspot environment to provide management and potentially to identify clients uniquely based on their MAC address. In our configuration, we are not using MAC address authentication or any of the related functionalities for hotspot login. We are solely focused on operating the MAC server functionality to respond to MAC discovery requests.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Step 1: Verify VLAN Interface**
    *   **Before**: Ensure that the VLAN interface `vlan-78` exists and is configured correctly and its associated subnet is `61.24.147.0/24`. The IP address of the router in this subnet is assumed to be already configured, and that all associated network configurations for the vlan are already present and operational.
    *   **Why**: This is a prerequisite for configuring the MAC server on that specific interface.
    *   **CLI Command (read-only)**:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan print
        /ip address print
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI**: Navigate to `Interface` -> `VLAN` and `IP` -> `Address` respectively, ensure that `vlan-78` is present and has the intended configuration. Also, check the IP configuration and make sure the router has an IP in the configured network.
    *   **After**: You should see the `vlan-78` in the interfaces with the desired VLAN ID configured and the IP address `61.24.147.x/24` (where x is the router address within this network) in IP addresses.

2.  **Step 2: Enable MAC Server on the VLAN Interface**
    *   **Before**: The MAC server is not enabled on `vlan-78`, MAC address discovery will not work on that interface.
    *   **Why**: To make the router respond to MAC address discovery requests.
    *   **CLI Command**:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface mac-server set enabled=yes interface=vlan-78
        ```
    *   **Winbox GUI**: Navigate to `Interfaces` -> `MAC Server`, enable the checkbox next to `vlan-78`
    *   **After**: MAC server is active on the specified interface `vlan-78`. You can verify this by listing enabled MAC servers.
    *   **CLI Command (Verification)**:
         ```mikrotik
        /interface mac-server print
         ```

3. **Step 3: (Optional) Configure MAC server allowed interface**
   * **Before**: The mac server is running on the interface, but it is not configured to only accept requests from that same interface.
   * **Why:** Limiting allowed interfaces increases security and makes it easier to troubleshoot.
   * **CLI Command**:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface mac-server set allowed-interface=vlan-78
    ```
    * **Winbox GUI**: Select the `vlan-78` interface on the `Interface`->`MAC server` page, navigate to the `General` tab, and then choose the `vlan-78` interface as the only allowed interface.
    * **After**: The mac server is now only processing discovery requests from devices on the `vlan-78` interface

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
# Verify VLAN interface (read-only)
/interface vlan print
/ip address print

# Enable MAC Server on vlan-78
/interface mac-server set enabled=yes interface=vlan-78

# (Optional) Configure MAC server allowed interface
/interface mac-server set allowed-interface=vlan-78

# Verify MAC server status
/interface mac-server print
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** MAC server not responding.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check that the correct interface (`vlan-78`) is configured in `/interface mac-server print`, the interface is enabled, and the interface is operational. Verify that the client is correctly connected to the network and is making the discovery request.
*   **Problem:** High CPU usage related to MAC server.
    *   **Solution:** In hotspot networks with many clients, make sure that only the necessary interfaces are enabled for the MAC server (e.g. `allowed-interface`). Review the amount of active devices in the interface using tools like `/interface monitor`.
*  **Problem:** Multiple MAC servers enabled in the same broadcast domain.
    * **Solution:** Ensure that you have only one MAC server active per broadcast domain to avoid duplicate responses or incorrect behaviours.
*   **Security Issue**: Unnecessary mac-server on multiple interfaces.
    * **Solution**: Enable the mac-server only on specific interfaces that you know need the functionality. Always limit access and exposure to minimize the potential security risks.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Use `mac-ping` from another device on VLAN `vlan-78`:**
    *   **Command**: Use MikroTik's `mac-ping` tool from a second RouterOS device connected to `vlan-78`.
        ```mikrotik
       /tool mac-ping interface=vlan-78 address=FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF count=3
        ```
    *   **Expected Output**: The router with the MAC server should respond to the MAC ping, showing a successful communication.
2. **Use a Network Tool (tcpdump)**
    * **Command**: Run tcpdump in the RouterOS with the command `/tool sniffer quick ip-address=61.24.147.0/24`
    * **Expected Output**: You will see ARP requests for MAC addresses and the replies of the router containing the MAC server, showing that the server is responding to the discovery requests.
3.  **Check MAC Server Statistics:**
    *   **Command**:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface mac-server print
        ```
    *   **Expected Output**: The `packets` and `frames` counters will increase as the server receives and replies to discovery requests.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Hotspot and User Management:** You can use MAC address information for client management, custom login pages, or specific user configurations in MikroTik Hotspot.
*  **Radius Server:** The MAC address of the client can be sent to the Radius server during authorization using the `Calling-Station-Id` attribute.
*   **DHCP Server:** MAC address information can be used for IP binding, static leases, or other DHCP options.
*   **MAC Address Filtering:** With the MAC server active, you can use MAC address filtering to allow or deny access to your network.
*   **Security:** While the MAC address can be used as an identifier, keep in mind that it can be easily spoofed by malicious actors. Always add additional layers of security.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

While there isn't a direct REST API call to "discover" a MAC address from the MAC server, the REST API can be used to configure it and see its properties.

**Example 1: Get MAC Server Configuration**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/interface/mac-server`
*   **Request Method:** `GET`
*   **Example Response (JSON):**
```json
[
    {
        ".id": "*1",
        "name": "vlan-78",
        "enabled": "true",
        "interface": "vlan-78",
        "allowed-interface": "vlan-78",
        "frames": "0",
        "packets": "0"
    }
]
```

*   **Error Handling**: The API will return a `200` status code for a successful request, `401` for authentication error, or `404` if the endpoint or resource is not found. Errors are sent as JSON objects containing an `message` parameter for debugging. For example: `{"message": "not found"}`

**Example 2: Enable MAC server for interface vlan-78**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/interface/mac-server`
*   **Request Method:** `PUT`
*   **Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
    ".id": "*1",
    "enabled": "true"
}
```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):** If there are not errors, the request will return a `200` status code, along with the updated information of the interface.

**Example 3: Add a MAC server**
*   **API Endpoint:** `/interface/mac-server`
*   **Request Method:** `POST`
*  **Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "interface": "vlan-78",
  "enabled": true,
  "allowed-interface": "vlan-78"
}
```
*  **Expected Response (JSON):** If there are no errors, the request will return a `201` status code, and a response like in example 1, with the added entry.
*   **Error Handling**: The API will return a `400` status code with a `message` parameter if any required parameter is missing, or has incorrect formatting.

**API Notes**:
- The `.id` field in the API response corresponds to the internal router identifier for the MAC server. You can obtain this ID when doing a GET operation in `/interface/mac-server` or by using command `/interface mac-server print`.
- When modifying an element with the API, it is always necessary to provide the `.id` parameter.
- For the POST example, you can add as many parameters as needed to configure the mac-server on creation.

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Enable only on required interfaces:** Don't enable the MAC server on all interfaces, as this increases the potential attack surface. Only enable on interfaces where needed for a specific purpose.
*   **Use `allowed-interface`:** Specifically restrict the interface(s) where the mac-server will respond to.
*   **Combine with other security methods:** MAC address information is not sufficient for robust security as it can be easily spoofed. Always combine with authentication, encryption, firewalls, and other techniques.
*   **Monitor CPU usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage for the MAC server. If there is a considerable amount of devices, the resource usage will increase. This is specially important when using low power or embedded devices.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **Scalability:**  For a very large Hotspot, consider whether the MAC server alone provides the necessary scalability for user management.
*   **Advanced Options**: Explore further options in `/interface mac-server` that have not been addressed, such as `use-radius`, and `radius-mac-format`.
*   **Automation**: This configuration can be further enhanced by using scripting to automatically enable or disable MAC servers depending on certain conditions.
*   **Error handling**: Add more specific error handling in case the mac-server is not enabled or is misconfigured.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic

The MikroTik MAC server is a feature in RouterOS that allows the router to respond to MAC address discovery requests. It acts as a kind of directory that maintains knowledge of which MAC address is where, specifically in the local broadcast domain. This is primarily useful in the following scenarios:

*   **Discovery Protocols**: The main use case is for protocols that need to find devices based on the MAC address.
*   **Hotspot and Management:** You can uniquely identify users via MAC address. This information can be used to deliver specific configurations or rules for certain users.
*   **Network Topology Mapping**: You can use the MAC addresses to map your network.
*   **Security Policies**: While not foolproof, MAC addresses can be used to configure some basic security rules.

The MAC server does not authenticate devices, it only responds to requests for MAC address discovery. For advanced use cases, the MAC server should be used in conjunction with other RouterOS features. The MAC server also does not learn MAC addresses automatically. It only responds with the router's MAC address to discovery requests.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **Resource Usage:** Enabling the MAC server will consume resources, primarily CPU. If you have multiple interfaces with the server enabled, the resource consumption will increase.
*   **Security vs. Convenience:** Using MAC addresses for identification can be convenient, but it is not a strong security mechanism, as MAC addresses can be easily spoofed by malicious users.
*   **Complexity:** Setting up advanced use cases of the MAC server (e.g., with RADIUS) increases complexity.
* **Network Discovery:** The MAC server provides an easy way to detect that a device exists, and this can be a vector for potential attacks.
* **Flexibility**:  The MAC server is an static device that responds to requests. The router will always reply with its own MAC address on the selected interface, so there is limited flexibility on the response content and behaviour.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration targets RouterOS 7.11, which includes the `/interface mac-server` functionality. The commands and parameters are applicable to most RouterOS 7.x versions (>= 7.0).

For RouterOS 6.48:
The basic concept and usage of the MAC server are the same. The command is `/interface mac-server`, and the configuration process is similar. However, some parameters or command outputs may be slightly different.  You should verify that the command output is as expected. For example, `allowed-interface` and other security parameters may not be available on older RouterOS versions. Always verify the documentation specific to your RouterOS version before making changes.

This should give you a very detailed explanation on the setup, operation, and security of a MAC Server on your MikroTik RouterOS device. Let me know if you have any other questions.
