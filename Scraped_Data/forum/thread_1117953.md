Hi everyone,I'm trying to block internet access except for two domains, I managed to block the traffic but I can't unblock it for the two domains. I applied this configuration:IP > Firewall > Filter Rules(rule position 1)Chain: forwardProtocol: tcpDst. Ports: 80, 443Action: drop(adjust position 0)Chain: forwardDst. Address: AuthorizedListAction: acceptIP > Firewall > AddressListList: AuthorizedListAddress: diretta.itThe problem that doesn't unlock the domain is I don't see packet exchange on rule 0.If I delete Dst. Address and enter the entry direct.it in "content". Instead I browse all the sites except direct.itWhere am I wrong?Thank you

Can you give this a try:Code:Select all/ip firewall rawaddaction=drop chain=prerouting disabled=yes dst-port=80protocol=tcp tls-host=!*diretta*addaction=drop chain=prerouting disabled=yes dst-port=443protocol=tcp tls-host=!*diretta*

Your AuthorizedList needs to at least include static.flashscore.com because most of the resources come from there. And probably content.livesportmedia.eu too. And your two rules should be below theCode:Select allaction=accept chain=forward connection-state=established,related,untrackedrule, if possible.Can you give this a try:Code:Select all/ip firewall rawaddaction=drop chain=prerouting disabled=yes dst-port=80protocol=tcp tls-host=!*diretta*addaction=drop chain=prerouting disabled=yes dst-port=443protocol=tcp tls-host=!*diretta*I don't think this will work. Because the tls-host is only present in the first few packets of the connection, and there is no connection tracking in RAW.
