I've never thought, I have to create a thread about a simple thing like routing, but I've come to a point where I don't know how to proceed.The setup is rather simple, I have a CHR instance running in a remote dc, and I need to get wireguard working between the CHR and a remote peer.There's a vrf called dc that has access to the public internet. It's the only uplink, no internet connectivity in the main routing table.I've tried adding routing/rules aswell as using mangle rules to steer the traffic without success. I see packets getting routed to the internet correctly, but the return traffic never makes it back to the wireguard interface, and I've no idea why.I assume, that the wireguard data plane, which handels the underlay network connection including handshakes always use the main routing table. Unfortunately, this isn't documented in any way.my config:Code:Select all[sysop@CHR]/ip/vrf>/ip/route prwhererouting-table=dcFlags:D-DYNAMIC;A-ACTIVE;c-CONNECT,s-STATICColumns:DST-ADDRESS,GATEWAY,DISTANCE#     DST-ADDRESS        GATEWAY            DISTANCE0As0.0.0.0/0195.XXX.XXX.193@dc1DAc195.XXX.XXX.192/26MGMT@dc0Code:Select all[sysop@CHR]/ip/vrf>/routing/rule/prwheretable=dcFlags:X-disabled,I-inactive4dst-address=87.XXX.XXX.191/32action=lookup-only-in-table table=dcCode:Select all[sysop@CHR]/ip/vrf>/tool sniffer quickinterface=MGMT port=51820Columns:INTERFACE,TIME,NUM,DIR,SRC-MAC,DST-MAC,SRC-ADDRESS,DST-ADDRESS,PROTOCOL,SIZE,CPU

Post the CHR config and the main router config/export file=anynameyouwish ( minus router serial #,  any public WANIP information, keys etc. )

As the config contains too much sensitive info, I've removed most parts of it. That's the config currently running on the CHR.The remote wireguard peer is a UDM, nothing special.As expected, it's still not working.Code:Select all/interfaceethernetset[finddefault-name=ether2]disable-running-check=noname=MGMTset[finddefault-name=ether1]disable-running-check=noname=PVE/interfacewireguardaddlisten-port=51800mtu=1420name=WG.UDM/ip smb usersset[finddefault=yes]disabled=yes/ip vrfaddinterfaces=MGMT name=dc/snmp communityset[finddefault=yes]addresses=0.0.0.0/0disabled=yesaddaddresses=::/0authentication-protocol=SHA1 encryption-protocol=AES name=wkkadmin security=private/system logging actionaddname=netwatch target=memoryaddname=ospf target=memoryaddname=firewall target=memoryaddname=wireguard target=memory/certificate settingssetcrl-download=yes crl-use=yes/ip neighbor discovery-settingssetdiscover-interface-list=all protocol=lldp,mndp/ip settingssetmax-neighbor-entries=8192rp-filter=loose tcp-syncookies=yes/interfacewireguard peersaddallowed-address=0.0.0.0/0,::/0endpoint-address=87.XXX.XXX.191endpoint-port=51820interface=WG.UDM name=peer6 persistent-keepalive=25spreshared-key="XXX"public-key=\"XXX"/ip addressaddaddress=195.XXX.XXX.206/26interface=MGMT network=195.XXX.XXX.192addaddress=192.168.11.7/24interface=WG.UDM network=192.168.11.0/ip cloudsetddns-enabled=yes ddns-update-interval=1mupdate-time=yes/ip dnssetallow-remote-requests=yes servers=8.8.8.8/ip firewall address-listaddaddress=87.XXX.XXX.191list=ADMINaddaddress=88.XXX.XXX.54list=ADMIN/ip firewall filteraddaction=accept chain=input comment="ESTABLISHED, RELATED, UNTRACKED"connection-state=established,related,untracked tcp-flags=""addaction=drop chain=input comment=INVALID connection-state=invalidaddaction=accept chain=input comment=ADMIN src-address-list=ADMINaddaction=accept chain=input comment=ICMP protocol=icmpaddaction=drop chain=input comment="INPUT DEFAULT DROP"log=yes log-prefix=INP_BLOCK/ip ipsec profileset[finddefault=yes]dpd-interval=2mdpd-maximum-failures=5/ip routeadddst-address=0.0.0.0/0gateway=195.XXX.XXX.193@dcrouting-table=dc/ip servicesettelnet disabled=yes vrf=*1setftp disabled=yessetwww disabled=yes vrf=*1setssh vrf=dcsetwww-ssl vrf=*1setapi disabled=yes vrf=*1setwinbox vrf=dcsetapi-ssl disabled=yes vrf=*1/ip smb sharesset[finddefault=yes]directory=/pub/ip sshsetalways-allow-password-login=yes host-key-size=4096host-key-type=ed25519 strong-crypto=yes/ipv6 ndset[finddefault=yes]advertise-dns=nora-delay=0sra-lifetime=10m/ipv6 nd prefixdefaultsetpreferred-lifetime=10m10svalid-lifetime=25w5d/routing ruleaddaction=lookup-only-in-table disabled=nodst-address=87.XXX.XXX.191/32table=dc/system clocksettime-zone-name=Europe/Berlin/system identitysetname=CHR/system loggingaddaction=disk topics=criticaladdaction=netwatch topics=netwatch,!debugaddaction=ospf topics=ospfaddaction=firewall topics=firewalladdaction=wireguard topics=wireguard/system notesetshow-at-login=no/system ntp clientsetenabled=yes/system ntp serversetenabled=yes multicast=yes/system ntp client serversaddaddress=17.253.34.253addaddress=17.253.52.125

Do you understand wireguard?If you do then you would realize this is nonsensical for the Server for handshake/interface wireguard peersadd allowed-address=0.0.0.0/0,::/0endpoint-address=87.XXX.XXX.191 endpoint-port=51820 interface=WG.UDM name=peer6persistent-keepalive=25spreshared-key="XXX" public-key=\"XXX"At the CHR it should be/interface wireguard peersadd allowed-address=192.168.11.Xinterface=WG.UDM name=peer6  preshared-key="XXX" public-key=\"XXX"and where is the allowed IP settings for the client router???/interface wireguard peersadd allowed-address=192.168.11.Yinterface=WG.UDM name=peerRouter  preshared-key="YYY" public-key=\"YYY"and where is the input chain wireguard rule to allow incoming handshakes to the CHR......../ip firewall filteradd action=accept chain=input comment="ESTABLISHED, RELATED, UNTRACKED" connection-state=established,related,untracked tcp-flags=""add action=drop chain=input comment=INVALID connection-state=invalidadd action=accept chain=input comment=ADMIN src-address-list=ADMINadd action=accept chain=input comment=ICMP protocol=icmpadd action=drop chain=input comment="INPUT DEFAULT DROP" log=yes log-prefix=INP_BLOCKSince I think this is now a prank post, I am outta here........

yes, I do understand the concept of wireguard very well. The allowed-address parameter simply limits the ip communication INSIDE the tunnel and has nothing to do with the handshake or the underlay network communication. The CHR is initiating the connection, so I have to specify the remote peer and port.0.0.0.0/0;::/0 allows incoming connections from any IP/IPv6 SOURCE address (again, inside the tunnel). It is not relevant for the described problem.Furthermore, the remote peer ip address (87.XXX.XXX.191) is part of the ADMIN address list, permitted to connect.

Then you have never stated clearly there is another router acting as the Wireguard server...... that is the router config I need to see.

solved it by using a separate routing table instead of a vrf. Not an ideal solution, but at least it works.My guess is, that this kind of setup currently just doesn't work with wireguard. Needs proper vrf support, like the other core services such as ssh, winbox,www..

Same issue, very badly waiting for WireGuard vrf support

there is no feature for that, i get that.But why is that hard to add it manually?

I agree nichky, seems like people just dont know how to use wireguard properlyTruth be told I havent used VRF but I think thats a BGP issue.   Attempting to use BGP and wireguard VPN .........As to my first statement, dont use overlapping subnets ;-PPP

how does asking for VRF support for wireguard and allegedly "not knowing how to properly use wireguard" relate to each other??
