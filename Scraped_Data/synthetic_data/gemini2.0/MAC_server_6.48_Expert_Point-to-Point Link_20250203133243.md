Okay, let's dive into configuring a MAC Server on MikroTik RouterOS 6.48, focusing on a point-to-point link scenario using VLAN interface `vlan-75` and subnet `103.92.224.0/24`.  I will provide detailed instructions, practical examples, and address potential pitfalls and best practices.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up a point-to-point link between two MikroTik routers.  We'll use a VLAN interface `vlan-75` operating within the `103.92.224.0/24` subnet. On one router, a MAC server will be configured on the VLAN interface, while the other router can use it for DHCP client or other functions.  A MAC server allows the router to offer IP addressing and other parameters based on the MAC addresses of connected devices. This is useful for static or semi-static addressing assignments.

## Implementation Steps:

### 1. **Step 1: Pre-existing VLAN Interface Verification**

*   **Description**: We need to ensure our VLAN interface (`vlan-75`) exists and is correctly configured. This is a prerequisite to setting up the MAC server.
*   **Before Configuration:**
    Let's assume you already have a physical interface configured (e.g., `ether1`) and a VLAN ID is associated with the interface.
*   **CLI Example to check interface**:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface vlan print
    ```
    This command will list existing VLAN interfaces. Look for `vlan-75` and note its `vlan-id` and `interface` properties.
*   **Winbox GUI Example**:
    Navigate to *Interface > VLAN*. Verify if *vlan-75* exists and its settings.
*   **Action**: If the interface does not exist, it must be created first. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.
*   **CLI Example to create interface**:
    ```mikrotik
     /interface vlan add name=vlan-75 vlan-id=75 interface=ether1
    ```
    This command adds a new interface named `vlan-75` with a VLAN ID of 75 on the physical interface `ether1` .
*   **Effect**: The `vlan-75` interface will be created and visible in the interface list.

### 2. **Step 2: IP Address Assignment**

*   **Description:** Assign an IP address to the `vlan-75` interface within the `103.92.224.0/24` subnet.  This is needed for the MAC Server to function on the network.
*   **Before Configuration:**
    The `vlan-75` interface is available but has no IP address.
*   **CLI Example to check interface IPs**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print
    ```
*   **Action:** Assign an IP address to the `vlan-75` interface. Choose an IP address within the range (e.g. 103.92.224.1/24).
*   **CLI Example to add IP address**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=103.92.224.1/24 interface=vlan-75
    ```
    This command adds the IP address `103.92.224.1` with a subnet mask of `/24` to the `vlan-75` interface.
*   **Winbox GUI Example**:
   Navigate to *IP > Addresses*, click the plus (+) button, and fill in the IP address, network, and interface.
*   **Effect:** The `vlan-75` interface will be assigned the specified IP address and subnet.
*   **CLI Example after setting interface IP**:
    ```mikrotik
        /ip address print
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
        #   ADDRESS            NETWORK         INTERFACE
        0   103.92.224.1/24    103.92.224.0    vlan-75
    ```

### 3. **Step 3: Configure the MAC Server**
*   **Description:**  Now, we enable and configure the MAC server on the `vlan-75` interface. This server will hand out IP addresses based on the MAC address.
*   **Before Configuration**:
    The MAC server is not configured, and won't hand out any IPs.
*   **CLI Example to check the server**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip mac-server print
    ```
*   **Action**: Enable the MAC server on the `vlan-75` interface.
*   **CLI Example to add mac-server**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip mac-server add interface=vlan-75 disabled=no
    ```
    This command adds a MAC server to the `vlan-75` interface and enables it.
*   **Winbox GUI Example**:
    Navigate to *IP > MAC Server*, click the plus (+) button, choose interface `vlan-75` and uncheck the *Disabled* box.
*   **Effect:** A MAC server is now active on the specified interface.
*    **CLI Example after creating the server**:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip mac-server print
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
        #   INTERFACE   ARP        DISABLED
        0   vlan-75       enabled      no
       ```

### 4. **Step 4: Define Static MAC Address Assignments (Optional)**
*   **Description:** (Optional) To assign specific IP addresses to specific MAC addresses, you define static MAC entries. If not configured, and DHCP is not present, the MAC server will rely on ARP to get a network address for the client.
*   **Before Configuration:** No static MAC entries are defined.
*   **CLI Example to check the MAC entries**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip mac-server entry print
    ```
*   **Action:** Add a static MAC entry. For example, let's assign `103.92.224.100` to the MAC address `00:11:22:33:44:55`.
*   **CLI Example to add MAC entry**:
    ```mikrotik
     /ip mac-server entry add mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 address=103.92.224.100
    ```
    This command creates a static entry, linking `00:11:22:33:44:55` to `103.92.224.100`.
*   **Winbox GUI Example**:
    Navigate to *IP > MAC Server > Entries*, click the plus (+) button and fill in the MAC Address and the IP address.
*   **Effect:** Clients with the defined MAC will always receive the static IP.
*   **CLI Example after adding the MAC entry**:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip mac-server entry print
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid
        #   MAC-ADDRESS       ADDRESS        TO-ADDRESS      VLAN    INTERFACE   DISABLED
        0   00:11:22:33:44:55  103.92.224.100                   vlan-75      no
       ```

### 5. **Step 5: (Optional) DHCP Client on the other Router**
*   **Description:**  Now, on the second router, we'll configure DHCP client to obtain an IP address via the MAC server. This step is a way to verify the MAC Server on the other router.
*   **Before Configuration:** Second router is not set to use DHCP
*   **CLI Example to check DHCP status**:
    ```mikrotik
     /ip dhcp-client print
    ```
*   **Action**: Add a DHCP client.
*   **CLI Example to add DHCP client on interface vlan-75**:
    ```mikrotik
     /ip dhcp-client add interface=vlan-75 disabled=no
    ```
    This command sets up the router to request an IP via DHCP from the first router on the `vlan-75` interface.
*   **Winbox GUI Example**:
    Navigate to *IP > DHCP Client*, click the plus (+) button and set the interface to `vlan-75` and uncheck the *Disabled* box.
*   **Effect:** The other router will obtain an IP address from the first router's MAC server, based on its MAC address.
*   **CLI Example after setting DHCP Client**:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip dhcp-client print
        Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic, R - running
        #   INTERFACE   ADD-DEFAULT-ROUTE  USE-PEER-DNS  STATUS        ADDRESS
        0   vlan-75       yes              yes         bound          103.92.224.x/24
       ```
## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the complete set of CLI commands:

```mikrotik
# Step 1: Create VLAN interface (if it doesn't exist)
/interface vlan
add name=vlan-75 vlan-id=75 interface=ether1

# Step 2: Add IP address to the VLAN interface
/ip address
add address=103.92.224.1/24 interface=vlan-75

# Step 3: Add the MAC server
/ip mac-server
add interface=vlan-75 disabled=no

# Step 4: (Optional) Add static MAC entry
/ip mac-server entry
add mac-address=00:11:22:33:44:55 address=103.92.224.100

# (Second Router) Step 5: DHCP Client
/ip dhcp-client
add interface=vlan-75 disabled=no
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Issue**:  MAC server doesn't hand out IP addresses.
    *   **Solution**: Verify:
        1.  The VLAN interface is up and working. Use `/interface print` to check it is active.
        2.  The MAC server is enabled and associated with the correct interface. Use `/ip mac-server print`.
        3.  The client device's MAC address is present in the static MAC entries (if used). Use `/ip mac-server entry print`.
        4.  No other DHCP server is present on the network.
*   **Issue**:  IP addresses are not assigned as expected.
    *   **Solution**:
        1.  Check for MAC address typos in static entries.
        2.  Ensure IP ranges do not conflict.
        3.  Verify the client is sending ARP requests or DHCP requests. Use the RouterOS tool `torch` on the interface `vlan-75` to check that clients are sending DHCP or ARP.
*   **Security Issue**:  Unrestricted access to the MAC server.
    *   **Solution**:
        1.  Use static entries, not leaving the server as a "default" DHCP server.
        2.  Restrict access via interface firewall rules. `/ip firewall filter`. For example, only allow packets with source macs from authorized devices.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Check MAC Server Status**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip mac-server print
    ```
    Verify that the MAC server for `vlan-75` is enabled.
2.  **Check Static MAC Entries**:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip mac-server entry print
    ```
    Verify the correct MAC addresses and corresponding IP assignments.
3.  **Test Connectivity from Client**:
    *   Connect a device on `vlan-75` or the other router using the dhcp client.
    *   Verify that the device receives the correct IP address using the device's network configuration and `/ip dhcp-client print` (for the router).
    *   Ping the `103.92.224.1` IP address from the client device.
4. **Use `Torch` tool**:
    * Start the torch tool to verify that clients are sending the DHCP or ARP broadcast messages.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=vlan-75
    ```

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server**: A DHCP server is an alternative to a MAC server. If you do not need static IP addresses per MAC address, and your setup is dynamic, a DHCP server is preferred.
*   **Firewall Rules**: Always implement firewall rules to restrict access and secure the network.
*   **VLAN Tagging**: VLAN tagging ensures proper traffic segmentation in more complex network configurations.
*   **VRF**: Use VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) instances to isolate MAC server instances for different groups or purposes.

## MikroTik REST API Examples (if applicable):

 "message": "already have such mac entry"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

*   **MAC Address Spoofing Prevention**:
    *   Use the firewall to allow only known MAC addresses and block packets from unknown sources on the MAC Server interface.
    *   Do not rely exclusively on MAC address filtering as it can be spoofed. Layer it with other security measures.
*   **Restrict API Access**:
    *   Use strong passwords for API users, limit permissions based on the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   Use HTTPS to encrypt API requests.
*  **General RouterOS Hardening**:
    * Disable any unused services.
    * Periodically update the software.
    * Implement a complex password policy.
    * Use firewall rules for access control.
    * Change default admin user and password.

## Self Critique and Improvements

The configuration provided is functional and detailed. However, here are potential improvements:
* **Dynamic vs Static:** A DHCP server with static leases might be preferable over a MAC Server in some scenarios, offering more control and options. This should be considered based on exact needs.
* **Advanced Firewalling**:  Firewall rules could be further defined, for example allowing access only from a specific subnet range, or for certain port numbers.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Setting up remote logging (Syslog) is essential for diagnosing issues in real-time in real-world scenarios.
* **Documentation:**  It is important to document all configurations thoroughly.
* **Backup:** Always take a backup of the configuration.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic

**MAC Server**

The MikroTik MAC Server is a less common feature that uses the MAC address of the connected devices, to assign IP addresses or other network settings. The server listens on network interfaces for client devices sending either DHCP Discover messages, or more commonly, ARPs. When a valid MAC is seen the server will answer and provide an IP address. This behavior resembles DHCP, but it does not use the DHCP protocol, instead it relies on ARP or similar low level protocols. The MAC server can also have static MAC entries, defining which MAC address should have which IP address. This provides similar behaviour to DHCP reservations.

**Why use a MAC server over DHCP?**
*   **Simple static addressing:** It provides a simple method for assigning IP addresses based on MAC address, which can be easier to configure than DHCP reservations, particularly for small setups.
*   **No DHCP Required**: Some devices may not fully support DHCP.
*   **Basic Network Setups:** MAC Servers are suitable for very basic network requirements.

**Limitations:**
*   **Less Functionality:** A MAC server has fewer configurable options than a full DHCP server. It does not support options like DNS servers, gateways, NTP servers, and other DHCP options.
*   **Scalability Issues:** It does not scale as well for large networks compared to a DHCP server. The server maintains it's IP and MAC association table in RAM.
*   **Security Issues:** MAC addresses can be spoofed, so relying solely on MAC addresses for security is not a good practice.
* **ARP-based:** By default it replies to ARP requests. As ARP is a broadcast protocol, it is susceptible to attacks.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs

*   **MAC Server vs. DHCP Server**: A DHCP server is generally preferred because it supports multiple DHCP options, and can be used on larger network scenarios, as DHCP clients discover the server before sending packets and is thus less vulnerable to MAC spoofing than ARP. However, a MAC server is simpler to setup if static IP addressing based on MAC address is needed, and there are few devices in the network.
*   **Static vs. Dynamic IPs**: Static IP addresses provided via static MAC entries in the MAC server allow predictable IP assignments, essential for services that require fixed IPs. Dynamic IP addresses via DHCP are more flexible and suitable for large networks, or when not required to have specific devices bound to specific addresses.
*   **VLAN vs. No VLAN**: VLANs create logically segmented networks, reducing broadcast domains and improving performance. However, they add complexity. Use VLANs when segmentation is required or if it is already a part of the network infrastructure.
*   **API Usage vs CLI Usage**: CLI commands are generally more efficient, and preferred by advanced users, while the REST API allows for programmatic access, suited for integrations and automation. API adds some overhead because of the added API request handling.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

The provided configuration is compatible with MikroTik RouterOS 6.48 and later 7.x versions. No RouterOS specific commands were used that would cause incompatibility between versions. All commands are basic and widely used across RouterOS versions.

By combining the above detailed steps, configurations, and examples, you have a robust and secure MAC server setup on your MikroTik router.
