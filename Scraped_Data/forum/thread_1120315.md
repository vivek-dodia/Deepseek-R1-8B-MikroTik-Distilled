How do you set one of these up that's not public but can be used internally for company use?If you are wanting to setup an internal ( not exposed to/from the Internet ) btest server , just connect a Mikrotik router ( one one Ethernet cable needed ) to the LAN/inside of your network.  Then go to the Mikrotik Winbox->tools->BTest-Server and click the Enabled box -- Presto you have a btest server for your inside network.You would btest from another Mikrotik router inside your network to the new btest Mikrotik router inside your network.  Login: admin Password ( what you set your password for ).Note:  This new Mikrotik btest server would allow you unlimited ( no timeouts ) for Mikrotik devices in your network to test against your inside btest server.North Idaho Tom JonesCan you make a RBmAP2nD into a btest server and do a bandwith test from the router. I have shut off all firewall filters on the router and still not able to connect via bandwidth test. my router is on ip 10.15.25.xxx, the mAP is in a bridge vlan with a 172.30.1.xxx.

Conceptually yes but don't expect huge results.Limited processor and only fast ethernet interfaces.You can use any Tik as btest server.

I did test your server from two remote locations (FL, OH).  Both did work at the time, but I can no longer connect.  That said, I swear that I did my best to stay away from exceeding the 10 minutes and followed the rules mentioned above.  How can I tell if I inadvertently exceeded my time limit?  I am trying to proof one of my customers that the MikroTik router is just fine and most likely it is their ISP.  Thank you in advance!I just now cleared the btest-jail Address-ListsSo you are no longer in btest-jail ( at least at the moment just now that I cleared the btest-jail lists ).North Idaho Tom JonesI thank you very much!  Will get back to you with my findings.

Hi Tom,Thank you for providing this free test server.Also tested for less than a minute on an asymmetrical 1G/50M link from Berlin, Germany.Tx/Rx: 53.0 Mbps/955.7 MbpsKind regards,SecOps7Are you having any strange issues/problems with your "asymmetrical 1G/50M link from Berlin" ?If my math is correct , you have an upload speed that is 5 percent of your download speed.( Would anybody correct me if I am wrong here please )On typical/average network devices that are receiving/downloading a TCP data stream will often have a 3 to 10 percent upload ( ACKs ) data stream.The TCP protocol is bi-directional traffic where the receiving computer is required to send ACK packets (I received your last packet - now send me the next packet).In your case , with a "asymmetrical 1G/50M link from Berlin" , I can see the following environment breaking your network with strange errors and data loss.Lets say you have 2 computers on your  "asymmetrical 1G/50M link from Berlin" Internet connection and they are doing the following:Computer # 1 is sending an email attachment ( sending a file ) and/or sending video in a video conference where this computer is sending at 25 meg.-- at this point you you only have 25-Meg free to upload because you are currently sending 25-Meg ( 50 - 25 = 25 )Computer # 2 is receiving a data stream of 750 meg.  This computer might need to send TCP ACK packets at a rate of greater than 25 meg.** At this point , your network wants to send ( bursts rates ) at greater than 50-Meg.  Because you are capped at sending at less than 50-Meg, both computers may now be having problems because of packet drops/loss on sent TCP/UDP traffic ( including sending TCP ACK packets ).  Sooo , your network starts to break and things start running slower than expected/needed.IMO and with my 20+ years of network experience , I have learned to never limit customer upload traffic to less than 10-percent of their purchased download account speed.  I have found that when using less than 10-percent , I begin to have some customer complaints of network problems.  So these days , I use a standard ratio of 20-Percent.In your case , if you were my customer with a 1-Gig download rate , I would limit you to a 200-Meg upload rate ( not 50-Meg ).  This with a 20-Percent up/down ratio, I would lever have any complaints about things not working to/from your Internet connection to me.If I were you , I would check to see if it is possible to increase your 50-Meg upload rate to at least 100-Meg ( or better 200-Meg  upload rate ).---Please , anybody - if you have an opinion and/or experience with upload/download bandwidth ratios that is not as I am saying , please give us your thoughts and suggestions.North Idaho Tom Jones

Are there any European servers that are up and working? I only get about 400 mbit to the US ones though my ISP is a gigabit fiber.I get about 900mbit using speedtest.netWhat's interesting though is that tools/profiling reports less CPU usage with speedtest.net at 900mbit than the local cpu stats show at 400mbit with the bandwidth test. So I would like to test a server closer to home and see if i can get it close to my fibers througput.I'm on a RB4011

Running speedtest is from a PC ?Logical then that cpu is higher when running btest on the router itself.Except for packet handling.which it is designed for, the router does nothing in the former case.Btest can be pretty cpu intensive.As long as it does not reach 100 on a single core, i wouldn't worry about it.

Re PC computer speedtest(s) verses Mikrotik's btest - any thoughts on this suggestion ?I think I would like to see an updated version of Winbox ( or something similar from Mikrotik ) where Winbox has a built-in btest server/client.This could enable the following types of speedtests :- PC Winbox btest ( speedtest ) to or from a Mikrotik router- PC Winbox btest ( speedtest ) to or from another PC computer also running a Winbox btest client/server ( Windows Winbox btest to another Winddows Winbox btest computer ).An added btest function in an updated Winbox could allow network admins to be able to get the entire picture of how the throughput of their network is doing because you could measure/test network I/O throughput between Windows servers and/or/to/from Windows PC workstations and/or/to/from Mikrotik ROS based routers/switches and even allow testing through VPNs and tunnels and bridges.The nice thing about adding a btest function to Winbox is that nothing is actually installed , it is only in the Windows PC memory when Winbox is running and btest is enabled/running.I for one would like to know how the Windows PC workstations on the networks I manage can handle heavy TCP-and/or-UDP traffic to/through my networks to all other points in or outside of my networks.Sooo , would something like this added function in Winbox ( or similar ) suggestion sound feasible and useful to you ?North Idaho Tom JonesEDIT:  Something like this feature could be useful to all network admins everywhere - even on the millions of networks that do not have any Mikrotik devices.  A Mikrotik branded btest tool like this would increase Mikrotik's product familiarity to millions of people/admins who would newly become aware of the Mikrotik brand.  ( aka - a Mikrotik sales boost tool ).--- OOOOoooo - and also limit it to a maximum of 15 to 60 seconds - to prevent users from killing their networks.

However , it's not popular and I don't know of anybody else who actually uses it.However , because both Winbox and btest.exe are both x86 code , I would think it would be simple to append the btest.exe code to the tail of winbox code , then add some winbox menu functions to access and use a slightly cleaner easier to use btest.exe

Just for my own clarification.  The current “Bandwidth Test” from the Winbox is not what we are looking for?  This is what I use from Winbox itself without any issues.GregC ,Looking at your post/image , you are using a Windows computer that is running a Windows Winbox program.  Your Winbox is then controlling a Mikrotik ROS device ( router or switch ) - and your winbox has opened the btest functions on the Mikrotik ROS device.If/when you run a btest , you are speed testing ( btest ) the TCP and/or UDP throughput of your Mikrotik ( to another Mikrotik ROS device ).  When the btest is running , the Mikrotik is performing the btest ( speedtest ) and the CPU on the Mikrotik is doing all of the work.  Your Windows computer itself is not speed-testing anything.Here is an enviornment where a btest function in Winbox that is running on a Windows PC computer can provide much more useful information :- 1) You have a nice/new/very-fast Windows computer- 2 ) Your computer has a 10-Meg Ethernet connection ( or a wireless connection ) to your Mikrotik ROS router device- 3 ) Your Mikrotik ROS router device has a 10-Gig fiber link to another 2'nd Mikrotik ROS device* When your Windows PC computer running Winbox sends commands to btest between both of your Mikrotik devices , you should get very close to 10-Gig ( if both Mikrotik devices have a fast enough CPU ).  This does not imply that your Windows computer can talk at 10-Gig.* If Winbox had a built-in btest function -- then you could btest ( using Winbox ) on your computer to either Mikrotik ROS device and you would get 10-Meg ( nothing faster ).  So why only 10-Meg instead of 10-Gig ?  --- Because you only have a 10-Meg Ethernet connection ( or wireless connection ) to the Mikrotik ROS device your PC computer is connected to.*** If you have multiple Windows PC computers/servers ( all running a Winbox with built-in btest functions ) , then you can btest ( speedtest ) from any of your Windows computers through your network(s) to another Windows PC computers/servers and then get a better picture of how fast your network really is ( not just Mikrotik to Mikrotik ).***** If somebody can run 1 mile in 10 minutes (Mikrotik btest to another Mikrotik) , the speed that somebody can run has nothing to do with how fast you or I can run.North Idaho Tom Jones

Outside of mikrotik btest we also have speedtest.net which you can run both from router from a docker container and from client PC.Also something that is useful is this list of public iperf3 severshttps://github.com/R0GGER/public-iperf3-servers

I still think this is a bit strange.Iperf3 with a bit lower bandwidth usage uses about 40% of a single core.Speedtest,net uses about 20% of a singel core while having a slightly higher bandwidth

I was already thinking along that line as well.It seems this is only applicable for UDP streams, not for TCP.iperf3 works similarly. If you use UDP and do not specify bandwidth, it will default to 1Mb/s.I understood the reasoning is because using UDP it is possible to saturate the line completely, even causing disconnect of your tools since there is no room anymore for other communication. TCP does not allow that. If the line is full, packets get dropped. Could be my explanation is technically not 100% correct but this is how I understood it works.

Ran a couple IPV4 tests from my 2116 in a data center in Utah on HE.net (10Gbps pipe).TCP hovers around 1Gbps, as high as 1400Mbps. CPU load on the 2116 is pretty minimal compared to the CHR.With UDP I'm able to saturate the full 4Gbps, smacking your CHR's CPU in the face at 100%, while the 2116 maxes out around 30% send, 20% receive.  This during peak hours (Monday night 9:30-9:50pm).IPv6 TCP receive worked one time, with a sudden burst to 2.6Gbps, then it dropped off.  I couldn't get TCP send or UDP tests to work.

I do this so that when a customer does a speedtest ,  they should normally see a little more than what they are paying for.

I needed a way to test from the router since none of my systems have more than a 1Gbps connection. I was switching around with different connection types (TCP, UDP) and receive vs send. TCP has it's obvious overheads, but UDP send did hit the 3Gbps, so I guess I am getting good service? :shrugs:This was from Loveland, CO, USAfirefox_RrTWd0PqHr.png

Hello,I work for a mail hosting provider, and while analyzing our spam traffic, we've noticed a significant amount of traffic originating from IP addresses with port 2000 open, identified as "MikroTik bandwidth-test server" on that port (with shodan). When we scan these IP addresses using nmap, it reports "cisco-sccp."We are curious as to why these machines are sending such a large volume of spam. While I'm not entirely sure if this is the right thread to address this issue, the topic seems closely related. Therefore, I would like to direct this question to those who might be directly involved or have knowledge about this phenomenon.Any insights or assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.Best regards,

OK - If you see your IP address list in the image below - and you continue to btest to my btest server without waiting 24 hours between btests, I am going to place your IP address on a 1-year block.All of the IP addresses listed below were supposed to wait 24 hours - but did not wait the required 24-hours.  Which then automatically placed them on a 1-Week waiting list b4 they can btest again.Soo , if this continues ( not waiting 24 hours between btest(s) to the btest server I manage , I will add an auto 1-year address list.  Where if you are on the 1-week waiting list and you btest again , then you are then auto placed on a 365-day waiting list.btest-address-list.png

Using the test server in the first post I was able to verify the connection bandwidth provided by my ISP. Results are 2.2/1Gbps, which is good given a SLA speed of 2.5/1Gbps.This was recorded using the UDP test. For newcomers, remember that depending on your firewall configuration, you might have to create a new rule allowing incoming UDP traffic for the duration of the test.Thanks to TomjNorthIdaho from Northern Italy.

I would love to know the reason for this see-saw behavior... ...You were testing using TCP.  TCP is a protocol that sends a packet and then waits for a received ACK packet ( ACK is a return message that a packet was received ).  This send , then wait for an ACK then send the next packet and wait loop is designed verify packets are being received and sent without packet loss.  Also , when an ACK packet is not received , the sending packet is then re-transmitted and a received ACK packet needs to be received b 4 the next new packet is sent.This works well.  This can be pretty fast for near-by network communications - however from Brazil to North Idaho , I would  guess there are all kinds of issues to slow down the time from when a packet was sent and the time to receive an ACK packet.  Some of those issues include distance ( packets are not moving at the speed of light - instead packets are moving at the speed of what each switch-hop can reliably run at , and the time of how fast all of the routers can run , and how congested each switch/router is and the link speed between every switch and router.Sometimes - I'm amazed the Internet even works - whewwwwNote - UDP is sometimes a better test for network speed because it is a send send send send protocol , there are no received ACK packages and there is no verification that a UDP packet was received or lost.Next time , try a UDP speedtest to my server and you might see a performance increase.  However, both TCP and UDP are used/needed to make the Internet work.Note - I just now cleared out  and reset all of the btest jail counters for everybody - so you can test again without waiting the normal time-out waiting period.North Idaho Tom Jones

Hey Tom,Thank you for the very good explanation! Makes total sense. I tried again this morning, with the first minute with UDP and the second minute with TCP:Captura de Tela 2024-02-03 às 10.33.40.pngThis is very interesting. With UDP, my download speed is close to the nominal, but the upload is ridiculous, 1mbps. With TCP the upload speed surpasses the download speed, way above what is contracted (my link is supposed to be 200mbps down/100mbps up). Is this something that may be wrong with my setup, or is something else, like shenanigans played by my ISP? Thanks again!

Hi,I'm new to mikrotik.I've seen last year an IT performing a bandwith test from another router mikrotik from another fiber line that I own but I can't remember the IP. He was telling me it  was the official bandwith test from mikrotik. But As I read more and more from this forum there does not seem to be an official speedtest or bandwidth test from mikrotik....Also I tried the north Idaho server from Tom and I can't ping it nor do the test....IS there a problem ?Thanks for any answers I might get

He's a storyteller or you probably misunderstood.No I clearly not misunderstood, then it means that he really believes that's the official bandwith test server from mikrotik.Is the first line of the first post.Do you read what's written on the topic before writing anything?Yes and that's why I'm writing here because it is the most updated topic on a possible bandwith test server operational from the forum. I must have missed that part about the ping then. Sorry about that.I totally get that it was a personal server so yeah I did read it or I would not have understood that -> logic.And through the ping it is my first reflex since I'm part of the scholar part of IT that consider that we should let ICMP running, not all of them but some of them, plus there are other means to prevent a possible ICMP overflow and ban the IP doing so. So that was my first reflex since the bandwith test was not running out of the box, it was to ping it.But apparently I was asking too much or it is considered as rude, I don't know.So sorry for the misunderstanding.Thank you for your answer tho

May 31, 2024 - thank you Tom for continuing to host this public mikrotik bandwidth test server.  Just tested from a client site after a faulty network cable limited their symmetrical speeds down to 100Mbps, and it was easy to connect to.

CroatiaTx/Rx Avg: 313.2 Mbps/349.1 MbpsActually i have a problem, my ISP sold a 1G/0.5G connection but i can download only cca 430Mbps. ISP modem is in bridge mode.ISP tech came and measured with his laptop connected directly to ISP modem 1G down so i think ISP side is ok.Anybody have idea how to configure mikrotik to engage full bandwidth?

I seem to have a probem on IPv6 - I see that connection(s) are up from firewall connection list, but traffic does not flow (only few kb/s rates are seen in torch). Strangely Bandwidth test reports remote CPU load as 100%. IPv6 transfer/speedtests to other IPv6 locations work OK.snap 2024-07-07 at 13.54.17.png

I got  TX/RX  average of 2.2 Gbps/1075.2 Mbps to 23.162.144.120 from Switzerland while showing me local CPU utilization of 7% and remote utilization of 100%. This is on a 10Gbps domestic fiber connection that should actually go all the way to 10Gbps since it is point to point.

Yup , I have it down for now.It was getting tons of abuse by many other Mikrotik network admins.I was seeing whole /24 & /23 & /22 networks where almost every IP address in ( customer ) nework blocks would sequentially one-after-another perform a btest to my Mikrotik btest server.When I see this type of network-block sequentially IPs performing btests one after another using their next IP address, I know it is somea-holeadmin who has created some cron/scripts so all of his networks/customers can be Internet throughput tested to my btest server.When I change the btest password or IP address, or the jail-wait-time-between-btests , or block the entire remote ISP's network ,  the auto btests stops ...  - until those same bad-actor Mikrotik admins change their scripts & their IP addresses to use the new IP address or new password or new timeout-waits - then again , I start getting hit with auto btests.I don't have the time to monitor and block entire remote ISP networks because some bad-actors will not follow my usage guide-lines to use my btest server.I'm not sure how I will resolve this issue.  I thought about making a subscription based btest system , but that's more than I wanted to do - and I wanted it easy & simple & free to use for Mikrotik admins.I will get it back up and running again - but at this moment it time , I'm pretty busy with some other ISP projects.  When I have some free time ( hopefully soon ) , I will bring this btest server back on-line.North Idaho Tom Jones

I'm very sorry that because of one stupid guy we all loose chance to usa a very precious service.Unfortunately this is humanity, stupid people existing.Maybe you can find a way to give a chance of 10 seconds test for each IP a day, maybe this can protect you from those mads. Thank you!.

Thank you a lot for this opportunity mateI?ve tested it from Saint Petersbug (Russia), I got 26mb download (while speedtest gives 77) and 41mb upload (while speedtest 88), so I guess it may be a fragmentation problem, or simply the interconnections between countries aren't that good, maybe because thye are checked/firewalled. I can't change the MTU on TCP for testing, on UDP seams you are not serving.Thank you again
