Same problem when try upgrade 6.49.17 => 7.12.1 => 7.17 on CCR2004 with errorupgrade failed, free 145 kB disk space for a (null)upgradeFrom 6.49.17 to 7.12.1 upgrade is OK, but from 7.12.1 to 7.17 - NO.Try this SOLUTION:1) upgrade step by step using download archivehttps://mikrotik.com/download/archive2) put file routeros-7.xx-arm64.npk to Files (Winbox) and reboot device3) upgrade step by stepKnown issueIn last 7.17 deleted old CAPsMAN module... if you use upgraded config, you need download extra packages - all_packages-arm64-7.xx and put wireless-7.xx-arm64.npk to Files (Winbox).
