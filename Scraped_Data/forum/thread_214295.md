Hello. I’m experiencing a link flapping issue with my MikroTik Cloud Router (CCR2116-12G-4S+). I have the ISP link connected to ether3. The setup is such that the MikroTik is connected to a switch that belongs to the ISP, which in turn is connected to the ISP’s router. As a result, I’m not receiving the uplink directly from the ISP router.I’ve tried replacing the LAN cable (for the ISP uplink) multiple times, but I continue to see the link flapping with messages like “Link OK,” “Unknown,” and “No cable detected.” The strange thing is that I should have an immediate Internet connection, since the cable is directly attached to the ISP's switch. However, when I attempt to ping the gateway, I get “No route to host” or “Timeout” errors.Also, I’ve tried all the ports on the router, but the flapping issue persists. Additionally, whenever I connect another device to the router on any port, the router goes down, and all the links start flapping.and, I’ve already reported this issue to the ISP, but I wanted to check if anyone here has encountered a similar problem before.......Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!
