I recently bought crs304-4xg-in as I upgraded my internet connection to 8Gbs and needed to replace my 1Gbe switch. I actually wanted unmanaged switch as I have no experience in networking but assumed that I can easily make it a 'dumb switch' (and got great price for the switch)As I understand it should work as such out-of-the box but it doesn't for me.I also tried:1.

I thought I will need to return itAnd thanks for the reply!Yes, Winbox via MAC.Make sense to keep it out of the bridge, looking how it is internally wired1. I reseted the configuration (no default).2. I've run[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge add name=bridge1[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether1[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3[admin@MikroTik] > /interface bridge port add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4as a result I haveafter such setup and router connected to ether 1 and pc to ether 4, my problem is best described by I don't have access to internet on PC.AlsoAny ideas how can I debug/investigate?

```
/ip dhcp-client
add interface=bridge
```

Well, the "dumb" bridge should have an IP (L3) assigned to be able to ping a destination.A "dumb" bridge is L2 and knows nothing of L3, while not becoming "smart"; it will become a "disadvantaged" switch if you give it a L3 address.Once an address is assigned to the interface, a dynamic route for the whole subnet (192.168.1.0/24) will be automatically added to the "main" route table.You could add a dhcp client to the bridge.Code:Select allBut from the PC, can you ping 192.168.1.1?
