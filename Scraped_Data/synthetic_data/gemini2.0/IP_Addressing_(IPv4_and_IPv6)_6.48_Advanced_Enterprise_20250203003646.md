Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive guide to IP addressing and other core MikroTik features, focusing on your specific requirements. This document will be lengthy and detailed, but that's necessary to cover all the advanced aspects.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** We're configuring a MikroTik router in an enterprise environment. The router is the gateway for the `3.113.74.0/24` subnet and manages other features like routing, firewall, and quality of service.
*   **Specific Requirement:** Assign the IP address `3.113.74.1/24` to the `ether-3` interface, the primary gateway for this network. We will then explore various features in detail while keeping this base configuration.
*   **RouterOS Version:**  This guide assumes RouterOS 6.48, but will also discuss compatibility and differences with version 7.x where relevant.
*   **Configuration Level:** Advanced
*   **Network Scale:** Enterprise

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

Here's how to implement the initial IP address configuration using both the CLI and Winbox, followed by a deeper dive into each feature and related concepts.

**2.1. Using the CLI**

*   **Connect** to your MikroTik router via SSH or the terminal in Winbox.
*   **Execute** the following command:
```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=3.113.74.1/24 interface=ether-3
```

**2.2. Using Winbox GUI**

*   **Open Winbox** and connect to your router.
*   **Navigate** to `IP` -> `Addresses`.
*   **Click** the `+` button to add a new IP address.
*   **Enter** the following:
    *   `Address`: `3.113.74.1/24`
    *   `Interface`: `ether-3`
*   **Click** `Apply` and then `OK`.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

Let's detail the core command used above, with its parameters and variations:

```mikrotik
/ip address
add
address=<ip_address/prefix>
interface=<interface_name>
network=<network_address> #Optional: calculated automatically if prefix is provided.
comment=<description> #Optional: For documentation.
disabled=<yes | no> #Optional: To enable/disable the address.
```

**Example CLI Configuration (with additional parameters)**

```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=3.113.74.1/24 interface=ether-3 comment="Main LAN Interface" disabled=no
/ip address print
```

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

**Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect Prefix:**  Using the wrong subnet mask or prefix length can lead to connectivity issues and overlapping networks.
    *   **Example Error:** `Invalid netmask 255.255.255.0 for address 3.113.74.1/23` (incorrect prefix)
*   **Interface Mismatch:**  Trying to assign an address to a non-existent or misconfigured interface.
    *   **Example Error:** `Interface 'ether-10' not found`
*   **Conflicting Addresses:**  Duplicate IPs on the same layer-2 network.

**Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:**

*   **`ping`:**  Use the `ping` command to test connectivity from the router or other devices on the network.
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 3.113.74.100
    ```
*   **`traceroute`:**  Identify network paths.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool traceroute 3.113.74.100
    ```
*   **`/ip address print`:** Review IP address configurations.
*   **`/interface print`:** Review interface status and configuration.
*   **Logs:**  Review `/system logging` for error messages.

**Example Error Scenario:**

You try to add the IP `3.113.74.1/24` to `ether-3` when another interface is already configured with an IP on the same subnet.
```mikrotik
/ip address
add address=3.113.74.2/24 interface=ether-4

/ip address
add address=3.113.74.1/24 interface=ether-3
```

**Error Output**: `failure: already have address on this subnet`

**Troubleshooting:**
* Use `/ip address print` to find the conflicting address.
* Remove or change the conflicting address with `/ip address remove <number>` where number is the number as displayed using `/ip address print`.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping Test:** Ping devices on the `3.113.74.0/24` subnet from the router.
*   **Connect:** Attempt to connect to the network from a device on the `3.113.74.0/24` subnet.
*   **`torch`:** Use torch to observe traffic on the interface, to check traffic is seen.
   ```mikrotik
   /tool torch interface=ether-3
   ```
*   **`monitor-traffic`:** This provides real-time traffic monitoring for a given interface.
   ```mikrotik
   /interface monitor-traffic ether-3
   ```

**7.2. Adding a new IP Address**

*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Example Curl Request:**
    ```bash
     curl -k -u 'admin:password' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{ "address":"192.168.89.1/24", "interface":"ether2"}' 'https://192.168.88.1/rest/ip/address'
    ```
*  **Example Curl Response:**

   ```json
  {"message":"added"}
   ```

*   **Example JSON Payload:**
    ```json
      {
        "address": "192.168.89.1/24",
        "interface": "ether2"

      }
    ```

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik uses bridging to create a layer-2 broadcast domain.  This is how interfaces can be grouped together so that they can interact with each other, acting like a switch.
*   **Routing:** Routing is the process of forwarding traffic between networks using routing tables. The RouterOS will select the most specific route it can find to send traffic to its destination.
*   **Firewall:**  A stateful firewall tracks TCP connections and filters traffic based on various criteria including source, destination, ports, protocol, and more. Firewall rules are processed sequentially so the order is important.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex and unique passwords for all users.
*   **Disable Unused Services:** Disable services you don't need (e.g., MAC server on public interfaces).
*   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to block unwanted traffic.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your RouterOS software updated to the latest version.
*   **Secure Winbox Access:**  Disable Winbox access from public interfaces and use a VPN.
*   **Limit API access**: Use strong passwords and only enable the API on secure internal networks.
*  **Use Role-Based Access Control**: Use RouterOS user groups to control access.
*  **Protect your backups**: Do not store configuration files on unencrypted mediums.

**10. Comprehensive Feature List, Examples, and Trade-Offs**

This section summarizes many of the features already discussed along with key considerations.

*   **IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6):**
    *   *IPv4 Example*: Already covered extensively.
    *   *IPv6 Example*: `/ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=ether-3`.
    *   *Trade-Offs*: IPv4 is well-understood, but IPv6 is increasingly needed for the future Internet.
*   **IP Pools**: Used by DHCP servers and PPP clients.
    *    *Trade-Offs*: If a large IP pool is used on an un-secure network it can lead to IP exhaustion attacks.
*   **IP Routing**:
    *   *Trade-Offs:* Static routing is simple, but dynamic routing is necessary for complex networks.
*   **IP Settings**:
   *   *Trade-Offs:* Changes should be done with caution, as this impacts the operation of the router.
*  **MAC server**:
    *   *Trade-Offs*: Used for management of MAC addresses on the network, should be disabled on untrusted networks.
*   **RoMON**:
    *   *Trade-Offs:*  Useful for large MikroTik deployments, but can be a security risk if not properly secured.
*   **WinBox:**
    *   *Trade-Offs:*  Easy management, but should not be exposed publicly.
*  **Certificates:**
    *    *Trade-Offs*: Secure communication, but can add setup and maintenance requirements.
*   **PPP AAA**:
    *   *Trade-Offs:*  Secure remote access, but can be more difficult to configure.
*   **RADIUS:**
    *   *Trade-Offs:* Centralized authentication, requires separate RADIUS server.
*   **User / User Groups:**
    *   *Trade-Offs:* granular access control, but can be complex to manage on large networks.
*   **Bridging and Switching:**
    *   *Trade-Offs:* Layer-2 network connectivity, but must be configured correctly to avoid spanning-tree problems.
*   **MACVLAN:**
   *   *Trade-Offs:* Creates multiple virtual interfaces on a single physical interface, but the physical interface must be in a bridge for it to work.
*   **L3 Hardware Offloading:**
   *   *Trade-Offs:* Increased throughput but decreases flexibility.
*   **MACsec:**
   *   *Trade-Offs:* Layer 2 security, but complex to set up.
*   **Quality of Service:**
    *   *Trade-Offs:* Improves network experience, but can introduce CPU overhead.
