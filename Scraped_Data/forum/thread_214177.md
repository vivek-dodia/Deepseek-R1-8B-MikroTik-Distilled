Hello MikroTik Community,I am facing an issue with downgrading my MikroTik hAP ax3 ARM 64 router from RouterOS version 7.18beta2 to 7.16.2. I have tried multiple methods but have been unable to get the desired version to install successfully.Steps Taken:Verified the correct .npk file: I confirmed that I am using the correct routeros-7.16.2-arm64.npk file for my routerâ€™s architecture (ARM 64).Uploaded the .npk file: I uploaded the file to the "Files" directory by dragging and dropping the .npk file using Winbox.Rebooted the router: After uploading the .npk file, I rebooted the router.Checked the packages: I verified that the file was present in the "Files" directory using /file print. I also checked the installed packages with /system package print, but the 7.16.2 package does not appear, and the router continues to show 7.18beta2.Attempted to remove the 7.18beta2 packages: I used the following commands to remove all components of the newer version:/system package disable wifi-qcom routeros rose-storage/system package remove wifi-qcom routeros rose-storageHowever, the system continues to show 7.18beta2 packages as installed.Checked logs for errors: I checked the logs with /log print where message~"package", and the following warning appeared:omitting package system-7.16.2: newer package system-7.18beta2 is already installedRe-uploaded the .npk file: I re-uploaded the file and rebooted, but the issue persists.What further steps should I take to downgrade to RouterOS 7.16.2?would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions.Thank you for your help!

```
/system/resource/print
```

For minimum ROS version you have to check this:Code:Select allSometimes it can be different than routerboot (I have a wAP ax withfactory-firmware: 7.15.2andfactory-software: 7.15.1).Anyway, proper way for downgrading is toget list of installed packages (disabled as well)upload all corresponding package files but for older version (e.g. routeros, wifi-qcom, rose, etc.)execute/system/package/downgraderebootBullet #3 is different from upgrading ROS via otherwise identical way.

It could be the new 'security' feature introduced in 7.17 -/system device-modehas been changed.By defaultinstall-any-versionis set tonowhich prevents installation of anything with a lesser version than listed inallowed-versions, seehttps://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/R ... evice-mode
