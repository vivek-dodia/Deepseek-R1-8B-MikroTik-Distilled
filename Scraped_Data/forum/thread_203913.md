```
/system logging action
add disk-file-count=10 disk-file-name=disk1/dudeLog/dudeLogNew disk-lines-per-file=4000 name=dudeLog target=\
    disk
# for testing (later)    
add name=dudeSyslog remote=127.0.0.1 target=remote

/system logging
add action=dudeLog topics=dude
add action=dudeLog topics=script

# testing
# Should get 2 entries, one sent to memory, second to dudeLog.
/log info message="testing"
```

```
/log info message="testing"
```

What I have works, but it was setup quite a while ago, so there maybe something I have missed here.Code:Select allNow In dude:In Notifications sectionAdd a NotificationCall it "log to syslog"It is of type loglog prefix=syslogSchedule should be active all the timeAdvanced, sorry not sure, doesn't really seem relevant.In Settings (Server Configuration) /Syslog TabEnabledPort 514Add an entryAction=accept Notification="log to syslog"# testingIn winbox, system loggingchange rule with script topic (created above) to action=dudeSyslogthenCode:Select allWith luck you should get 2 messages in log again,but now one message should be dude, event, and have syslog: prefix in front of it.Change script rule action back to dudeLog (or disable it)Edit: Also need to firewall rule to allow udp port 514 input.
