Okay, let's craft some detailed, expert-level MikroTik documentation focusing on IP addressing for a SOHO environment, using the specified subnet and interface.

## Scenario Description:

We are setting up a small office/home office (SOHO) network using a MikroTik router running RouterOS 7.11 (or newer 6.48, 7.x). The router will manage wireless clients connecting via an interface named "wlan-99," with an IPv4 subnet of 99.150.4.0/24. IPv6 configuration is included as a futureproofing measure. Clients connecting via wlan-99 will receive dynamic IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from this subnet.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure IP addressing for the `wlan-99` interface on your MikroTik router.

1.  **Step 1: Create and Enable the WLAN Interface**

    *   **Why:** This step ensures that the interface named `wlan-99` exists. If you already have a wireless interface that you want to use, then rename it to `wlan-99` using `/interface wireless set wlan1 name=wlan-99`.  If you do not have one, you'll have to create one first.
    *   **Before:** The router's interface list may or may not include `wlan-99`.
    *   **Action:** Via CLI (replace `wlan1` as needed):

    ```mikrotik
    /interface wireless
    add name=wlan-99 mode=ap-bridge ssid=MySSID security-profile=default
    /interface wireless enable wlan-99
    ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `Wireless > Interfaces`. Click the `+` to add the interface. Set `Mode` to `ap-bridge`, `SSID` to `MySSID`, `Security Profile` to `default` and `Name` to `wlan-99`. Click `OK`.
        Then check the Enabled box for `wlan-99`
    *   **After:** The router has an enabled wireless interface named `wlan-99`.
    *   **Expected Result:** A new wireless interface will appear in `/interface wireless print` output. You should also see this interface in the Winbox interfaces list.

2.  **Step 2: Add IPv4 Address to the Interface**

    *   **Why:** This assigns an IPv4 address to the `wlan-99` interface, providing a gateway for devices in that subnet. We'll use `99.150.4.1/24` as the router's IP address on that network.
    *   **Before:**  The `wlan-99` interface has no assigned IPv4 address.
    *   **Action:** Via CLI:

    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=99.150.4.1/24 interface=wlan-99 network=99.150.4.0
    ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `IP > Addresses`. Click the `+` button. Set `Address` to `99.150.4.1/24`, select `wlan-99` for the `Interface`, and click `OK`.
    *   **After:** The `wlan-99` interface has IP address `99.150.4.1/24` assigned.
    *   **Expected Result:** `ip address print` shows 99.150.4.1/24 assigned to the wlan-99 interface. This will now be the gateway for devices connected to the wlan-99 wireless network.

3.  **Step 3: Setup DHCP Server for IPv4**

    *   **Why:** This allows client devices to automatically obtain an IP address from the 99.150.4.0/24 subnet via DHCP.
    *   **Before:** Clients on `wlan-99` cannot get an IP address automatically.
    *   **Action:** Via CLI:

    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=dhcp_pool_99 ranges=99.150.4.10-99.150.4.254
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=dhcp_pool_99 disabled=no interface=wlan-99 name=dhcp-server-99
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=99.150.4.0/24 dns-server=99.150.4.1 gateway=99.150.4.1
    ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `IP > Pool`, click `+`, and create a pool with a name `dhcp_pool_99` and a Range `99.150.4.10-99.150.4.254`, click ok.
        Then navigate to `IP > DHCP Server`. Click on the `DHCP` tab, then click the `+` button. Set `Interface` to `wlan-99`, `Name` to `dhcp-server-99`, check that disabled is not checked, and click `OK`.
        Then click on the `Networks` tab and click the `+` button. Set `Address` to `99.150.4.0/24`, `Gateway` to `99.150.4.1`, and `DNS Server` to `99.150.4.1`, click ok.
    *   **After:** Clients connecting via `wlan-99` can obtain IPv4 addresses from the defined DHCP range.
    *   **Expected Result:** Connecting clients will automatically receive an IP address and gateway setting.

4.  **Step 4: Add IPv6 Address to the Interface (Optional but recommended)**

    *   **Why:** This enables IPv6 connectivity on the interface. It's good practice to implement IPv6 even if you don't actively use it now. We will use a link-local address for now.
    *   **Before:**  The `wlan-99` interface does not have an assigned IPv6 address.
    *   **Action:** Via CLI:

        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 address
        add address=fe80::1/64 interface=wlan-99
        ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `IPv6 > Addresses`. Click the `+` button. Set `Address` to `fe80::1/64`, select `wlan-99` for the `Interface`, and click `OK`.
    *   **After:** The `wlan-99` interface has link-local IPv6 address `fe80::1/64` assigned.
    *   **Expected Result:** `ipv6 address print` shows `fe80::1/64` assigned to the wlan-99 interface. This is a unique link-local IPv6 address assigned to the router.

5.  **Step 5: Setup Router Advertisement for IPv6 (Optional)**

    *   **Why:** This will allow connected clients to auto-configure their IPv6 address using SLAAC.
    *   **Before:** Clients on `wlan-99` do not automatically receive IPv6 addresses other than link-local.
    *   **Action:** Via CLI:

        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 nd
        add interface=wlan-99  advertise-dns=yes managed-address-flag=no other-config-flag=no  advertise-mtu=yes
        ```

    *   **Winbox GUI:** Navigate to `IPv6 > ND`, click the `+` button. Select `wlan-99` as the `Interface`, select the `Advertise DNS` box, and ensure the `Managed Address Flag` and `Other Config Flag` are not selected. Select the `Advertise MTU` box. Click `OK`.
    *   **After:** Clients connecting via `wlan-99` can obtain IPv6 addresses and DNS server automatically.
    *   **Expected Result:** Connecting clients will automatically receive a global IPv6 address and DNS setting.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

```mikrotik
/interface wireless
add name=wlan-99 mode=ap-bridge ssid=MySSID security-profile=default

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Wireless Interface Not Enabling:**
    *   **Problem:** The wireless interface might not enable if the correct wireless security settings are not configured.
    *   **Solution:**  Ensure a security profile is configured with a valid password or other settings, and associated with the wireless interface. Review your `/interface wireless security-profiles print` for the `default` security profile, and adjust the password.
*   **DHCP Not Assigning IP Addresses:**
    *   **Problem:** DHCP server may not be running.
    *   **Solution:**  Check DHCP server status with `/ip dhcp-server print` for the `enabled` setting on `dhcp-server-99`. Check if the interface it is assigned to is the right interface. Also, ensure the IP pool range and interface are correctly configured. Check the `IP > DHCP Server > Leases` table for assigned leases.
*   **IPv6 Connectivity Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Clients not receiving IPv6 addresses.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure IPv6 Router Advertisements are enabled on the `wlan-99` interface. Use `/ipv6 nd print`.
*   **Resource Usage:**
    *   **Problem:** High CPU usage.
    *   **Solution:** Monitor CPU usage using `/system resource monitor`.  For a very basic configuration this will almost never be a problem. More complex wireless configurations can have an impact.  Consider disabling or simplifying features not required for basic network functions.
*   **Security Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Using default passwords and weak security configurations.
    *   **Solution:** Change the default `admin` password and use strong encryption for wireless networks (WPA2 or WPA3). Be sure that you have not enabled a telnet or ftp server on the device.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Interface Status:**
    *   Use `/interface wireless print` and verify that the `wlan-99` interface is enabled and running. Check for `running=yes`.
2.  **IP Address Assignment:**
    *   Use `/ip address print` and confirm that `99.150.4.1/24` is assigned to the `wlan-99` interface. Use `/ipv6 address print` and confirm `fe80::1/64` is assigned to `wlan-99`
3.  **DHCP Server Status:**
    *   Use `/ip dhcp-server print` to confirm the `dhcp-server-99` is enabled.
    *   Connect a client to the `wlan-99` network and check if it receives an IP address within the `99.150.4.0/24` subnet. Verify using `ipconfig /all` or similar command.
4.  **IPv6 Testing:**
    *   Connect a client to the `wlan-99` network and check if it receives a IPv6 address in the form of a 2000::/3 address.
    *   Use `ping6 -c 3 google.com` from a connected client or use the MikroTik tools to test IPv6 connectivity, such as `/tool ping6 <ipv6-address>`
5.  **Use `Torch` Tool:**
    *   Use `/tool torch interface=wlan-99` to monitor traffic on the interface.  This tool will show you what traffic is flowing in real time.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **Firewall:** You will want to configure the MikroTik firewall to protect your network from unwanted connections from the outside internet, especially if you will be routing to the internet. `/ip firewall filter print` and `/ip firewall nat print` will help to show existing configurations.
*   **Guest Network:** Create a separate SSID and VLAN for guest access for security.
*   **Bandwidth Management:** Configure QoS to prioritize traffic based on your needs using `/queue tree print` or `/queue simple print`.
*   **VPN:** You might want to add VPN functionality with IPsec or WireGuard for remote access, or connecting to other branch offices.
*   **DNS:** In addition to the local DNS provided on the gateway you might want to use a different DNS forwarder such as google or cloudflare dns.

## MikroTik REST API Examples:

Let's examine a practical API example to add an IPv4 address.

**API Endpoint:** `/ip/address`

**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "address": "99.150.4.2/24",
  "interface": "wlan-99",
  "network": "99.150.4.0"
}
```

**Expected Response (Success):**

```json
{
  ".id": "*11",
   "address": "99.150.4.2/24",
   "interface": "wlan-99",
  "network": "99.150.4.0"
}
```

**Example API call for adding an IPv6 Address:**

**API Endpoint:** `/ipv6/address`

**Request Method:** POST

**Example JSON Payload:**
```json
{
  "address": "2001:db8::1/64",
  "interface": "wlan-99"
}
```

**Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  ".id": "*12",
   "address": "2001:db8::1/64",
   "interface": "wlan-99"
}
```

**Error Handling:**
*   **Error Response:** If an error occurs (e.g., invalid interface, duplicate address) the API will return a 400-series error or 500 status code, along with a message detailing the issue in a JSON object similar to: `{"message": "input does not match any value of interface"}`

## Security Best Practices:

*   **Use Strong Passwords:** Never use default passwords for any accounts, especially the admin user.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable telnet, ftp and other services you do not need.
*   **Secure Wireless:** Use WPA2 or WPA3 security with a strong passphrase.
*   **Firewall:** Implement a firewall to control traffic between networks and the internet. Protect your management interfaces from external access.
*   **Regular Updates:** Always keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   **Limit API Access:** Restrict the IP addresses from which API access is allowed.
*   **HTTPS for API:** Use HTTPS (with a certificate) for all API calls to prevent eavesdropping.

## Self Critique and Improvements:

*   **More Detailed Security:** We could expand security configuration with more complex firewall rules and access lists.
*   **Advanced QoS:** Implement advanced queue trees to provide better QoS for real-time applications.
*   **Redundancy:** Adding VRRP configuration for redundancy is an option.
*   **Monitoring:** Could implement SNMP or other monitoring solutions for alerting and real-time analysis.
*   **Error Handling:** API error handling could be more robust, with logging and alerts.

## Detailed Explanations of Topic:

**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**

IPv4 is the foundational protocol for most of the internet. It uses 32-bit addresses, usually represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It is a connectionless protocol. IPv4 includes unicast, multicast and broadcast packets for various applications. While still widely used, IPv4 is now running out of available addresses, leading to the adoption of IPv6.

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**

IPv6 is the next-generation IP protocol. It uses 128-bit addresses, represented in hexadecimal colon-separated notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). It has a vastly larger address space than IPv4, solving the IPv4 address exhaustion issue. IPv6 includes a variety of features designed to improve IP addressing, such as router advertisement.

**IP Addressing in MikroTik:**

MikroTik's RouterOS supports full IPv4 and IPv6 functionality. You can assign addresses to interfaces, configure DHCP servers, setup IPv6 router advertisement, and perform complex routing and filtering based on both IPv4 and IPv6. In RouterOS, each interface can have multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and these can be statically assigned or dynamically obtained using DHCP/DHCPv6 protocols. MikroTik's implementation includes a very configurable router advertisement section which allows fine tuning of advertised IPv6 flags.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

*   **Static vs. Dynamic IP Assignment:**
    *   **Static:** Offers predictable IP addresses. Can be easier to manage for a smaller number of devices. More difficult to manage and to scale with increasing number of devices.
    *   **Dynamic (DHCP):**  Automates IP assignment, suitable for larger networks or frequent device additions. Simplifies address management. More difficult to troubleshoot in very large networks.
*   **SLAAC vs. DHCPv6:**
    *   **SLAAC (Stateless Address Auto Configuration):** Simpler, allows devices to generate addresses based on router advertisement. Less flexible, can be harder to implement with special features or options.
    *   **DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6):** More configurable, similar to DHCP for IPv4, provides more control over address assignment and options.
*   **Overlapping Subnets:**
    *   **Trade-off:** Using overlapping subnets is usually not recommended because it creates routing issues, however there are use cases where it can be a valid option. Using non-overlapping networks will always be the best approach if there is any doubt.
*   **Link-Local vs. Global IPv6 Addresses:**
    *   **Link-Local:** Necessary for devices on the same local network to communicate without a router, such as to manage the device. Will not allow communication to the internet.
    *   **Global:** Necessary for devices to communicate to the wider internet or other networks. Must be set up using a router.

## Configuration for Specific RouterOS Versions:

This configuration was tested on version 7.11. The commands should work mostly unchanged for RouterOS 6.48 and later 7.x versions as well. If you are using a much older version of RouterOS, some commands might be slightly different, or non existent. Always check the MikroTik documentation if any command appears to fail, especially if it is a security-related feature.

This documentation should provide a comprehensive guide to setting up basic IP addressing for a SOHO network using MikroTik RouterOS. The specific commands and examples should help any administrator get their network up and running in no time.
