## Initial Question
Hi, I was wondering what went wrong in my settings.I have this problem that every time the clients turn off their wifi the time will automatically paused. Supposedly even if they turned off their wifi the time will keep going but recently it will stop the moment they will turn off their Wifi. How can I prevent their time from pausing every time they turned off their wifi.Thank you ---

What "clients"? What "time"? ---
