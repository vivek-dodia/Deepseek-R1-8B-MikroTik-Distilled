# MikroTik RouterOS IP Pool Configuration for ISP Environment

This document provides a detailed guide on configuring IP Pools within a MikroTik RouterOS device, specifically designed for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) environment. We will focus on practical examples, CLI commands, troubleshooting, and best practices relevant to MikroTik devices.

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Requirements

**Scenario:**

An ISP needs to assign IP addresses dynamically to subscribers connected on VLAN 19 (interface name: `vlan-19`). The ISP has the public IP subnet `90.181.102.0/24` available for this purpose. We need to configure an IP pool to manage and distribute these addresses.

**Specific MikroTik Requirements:**

*   RouterOS version: 6.48 (or 7.x compatible).
*   Configuration Level: Basic
*   Network Scale: ISP
*   Subnet: 90.181.102.0/24
*   Interface Name: `vlan-19`
*   Implement IP Pool for dynamic assignment of IPs.
*   Provide detailed configuration, CLI examples, and troubleshooting.
*   Security best practices, especially for less common features.
*   Include REST API example for this IP pool.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

Here's a step-by-step guide using both the CLI and Winbox, along with explanations:

### 2.1. Using CLI

**Step 1: Create the IP Pool**

```mikrotik
/ip pool
add name=isp-pool ranges=90.181.102.10-90.181.102.250
```
**Explanation:**

*   `/ip pool add`: Creates a new IP pool.
*   `name=isp-pool`:  Sets the name of the pool to `isp-pool`.
*   `ranges=90.181.102.10-90.181.102.250`: Defines the range of IP addresses available in the pool. Weâ€™re leaving .1 - .9 for router use and .251 - .254 for other network devices if required and broadcast addresses.

**Step 2: Configure DHCP Server**

A DHCP server will use the pool. The interface `vlan-19` should be set up and it should be already enabled.

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=isp-pool disabled=no interface=vlan-19 lease-time=10m name=dhcp-isp
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=90.181.102.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=90.181.102.1
```
**Explanation:**

*   `/ip dhcp-server add`: Creates a new DHCP server.
*   `address-pool=isp-pool`: Specifies the previously created pool as the source for leases.
*   `disabled=no`: Enables the DHCP server.
*   `interface=vlan-19`: Binds the server to the `vlan-19` interface.
*   `lease-time=10m`: Sets the lease time to 10 minutes (this may need to be adjusted depending on the ISP setup.)
*   `/ip dhcp-server network add`: Adds the network configuration for the DHCP server.
*   `address=90.181.102.0/24`: Defines the network address and subnet mask.
*   `dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4`: Sets DNS servers for DHCP clients.
*   `gateway=90.181.102.1`: Specifies the default gateway for clients.

**Step 3: Verify the Configuration**
```mikrotik
/ip pool print
/ip dhcp-server print
/ip dhcp-server network print
```

## 4. Common Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

### Common Pitfalls:

*   **Incorrect IP Range:** Ensure the IP pool range is within the subnet and does not overlap with other devices.
*   **Conflicting IP Addresses:** Verify no static IPs are assigned within the IP pool range.
*   **VLAN Interface Issues:** Check if the `vlan-19` interface is properly configured and enabled.
*   **DHCP Not Enabled:** Ensure the DHCP server is not `disabled`.
*   **Incorrect Gateway or DNS:** Verify the correctness of gateway and DNS settings for DHCP clients.
*   **Lease Time:** Keep lease time short, unless you have static clients.

### Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:

1.  **DHCP Leases:**
    *   Use `/ip dhcp-server lease print` to view assigned leases.
    *   If no leases appear, check client connectivity and DHCP server settings.
2.  **Ping:**
    *   Use `/ping 90.181.102.1` (or another target) from the router to test basic connectivity.
    *   Use `ping <client_ip>` on the router to reach clients.
3.  **Torch:**
    *   Use `/tool torch interface=vlan-19` to capture and analyze DHCP traffic.
    *   Filter by `port=67` for DHCP server traffic or `port=68` for DHCP client traffic.
4.  **Log:**
    *   Use `/log print` to view system logs, looking for errors related to DHCP or IP pools.
5.  **Error Scenario Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** The IP Pool range overlaps with the router's IP address.
    *   **Error:** DHCP might not assign addresses or might result in address conflicts.
    *   **Solution:** Adjust the IP pool range or change the router's IP address.
    * **Error Example:** Incorrect VLAN settings. The interface is not correctly configured as a VLAN on the bridge. You might need to add the correct VLAN Tag under `Interfaces -> VLAN`

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **Connect a client:** Connect a client to the `vlan-19` network.
2.  **Check for IP Assignment:** Verify that the client receives an IP address from the `isp-pool` range.
3.  **Ping Test:** Ping the default gateway (90.181.102.1) from the client.
4.  **Internet Access:** Verify the client has internet access.
5.  **Router Log:** Check the logs on the RouterOS for client DHCP requests.
6.  **DHCP Lease List:** Verify the DHCP client appears in the lease list using `/ip dhcp-server lease print`
