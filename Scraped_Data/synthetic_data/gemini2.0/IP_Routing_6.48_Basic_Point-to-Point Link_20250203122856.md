Okay, let's dive into a detailed technical document for configuring IP routing on a MikroTik router, focusing on a basic point-to-point link within the given subnet.

## Scenario Description:

This document outlines the configuration of a basic point-to-point link using a MikroTik RouterOS device. We'll be focusing on setting up IP routing within the subnet `136.111.165.0/24`, specifically for an interface named `bridge-92`.  This scenario is common in small office/home office (SOHO) environments or when establishing a simple link between two devices.

## Implementation Steps:

Here's a step-by-step guide to configure the IP address on the bridge interface and ensure basic IP routing:

**Step 1: Check Existing Configuration**

*   **Why?** Before making changes, it's crucial to understand the current configuration of the router. This prevents conflicts and allows for easy rollback if needed. We are going to check if the interface exists.
*   **Action (CLI):**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface print
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** The output will list all interfaces on the router. Look for `bridge-92`. If it does not exist, we will create the interface bridge in the next step.
*   **Action (Winbox):** Navigate to `Interface` and check if bridge-92 exists.

**Step 2: Create the Bridge Interface (if it doesn't exist)**
*   **Why?**  We are going to create the interface bridge in the event that it does not already exist.
*   **Action (CLI):**
    ```mikrotik
     /interface bridge add name=bridge-92
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** The output will show that the bridge interface has been created. We can verify by using the previous step of `/interface print`
*   **Action (Winbox):** Navigate to `Interface->Bridge` and create a new bridge interface named `bridge-92`.

**Step 3: Assign an IP Address to the Bridge Interface**

*   **Why?**  For routing to work, the interface needs an IP address within the defined subnet. We will assign the IP `136.111.165.1/24` to the bridge interface.
*   **Action (CLI):**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address add address=136.111.165.1/24 interface=bridge-92
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** After execution, the router will have the specified IP address configured on the bridge interface. You can verify this by using the following command in the CLI `/ip address print`
*   **Action (Winbox):** Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`. Click the "+" button and add IP address 136.111.165.1/24 to interface bridge-92.

**Step 4: Verify IP Address Configuration**

*   **Why?** Verify the IP address has been configured.
*   **Action (CLI):**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address print
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** The output will list all IP addresses assigned to interfaces, including the newly assigned address on `bridge-92`. You should see something like the following:
```
    Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic
    #   ADDRESS            NETWORK        INTERFACE
    0   136.111.165.1/24   136.111.165.0  bridge-92
```
*   **Action (Winbox):** Verify that the address shows up in the `IP` -> `Addresses` window.

**Step 5: Test Connectivity (optional)**

*   **Why?** Verify local connectivity by pinging the address of the `bridge-92`.
*  **Action (CLI)**
    ```mikrotik
    /ping 136.111.165.1
    ```
*   **Expected output:** You should see successful pings.
```
    SEQ HOST ADDRESS                                    SIZE TTL TIME  STATUS
      0 136.111.165.1                            56  64    0ms  echo reply
      1 136.111.165.1                            56  64    0ms  echo reply
      2 136.111.165.1                            56  64    0ms  echo reply
      3 136.111.165.1                            56  64    0ms  echo reply
      4 136.111.165.1                            56  64    0ms  echo reply
    sent=5 received=5 packet-loss=0% min-rtt=0ms avg-rtt=0ms max-rtt=0ms
```
* **Action (Winbox):** Open a `new terminal` and run the ping command `/ping 136.111.165.1`.

**Step 6:  (Additional) Enabling Routing (If needed)**

*   **Why?** By default, RouterOS will forward packets between interfaces. However, if you disabled forwarding, then you will need to enable forwarding for the routing to work.
*   **Action (CLI):**
     ```mikrotik
     /ip settings set forwarding=yes
     ```
*   **Expected Output:** You can check that forwarding is enabled by running the command `/ip settings print`.
*   **Action (Winbox):** Navigate to `IP->Settings`, and ensure that the `enable` checkbox for forwarding is enabled.

## Complete Configuration Commands:

Here's the complete set of MikroTik CLI commands to implement this setup:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge add name=bridge-92
/ip address add address=136.111.165.1/24 interface=bridge-92
/ip settings set forwarding=yes
```

**Parameter Explanations:**
| Command              | Parameter     | Description                                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/interface bridge add`| `name` |  The name of the bridge interface.     |
| `/ip address add`  | `address`     | The IP address and subnet mask (CIDR notation) to assign to the interface.        |
|                     | `interface`   | The interface on which to assign the IP address.                                    |
| `/ip settings set` | `forwarding` |  Enables IP packet forwarding. Required if default forwarding is disabled. |

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

*   **Problem:** Incorrect subnet mask or IP address assignment.
    *   **Solution:** Double-check the `/ip address print` output. Correct using `/ip address set <number> address=<correct_address/mask>`.
*   **Problem:** Interface `bridge-92` does not exist.
    *   **Solution:** Create the interface bridge using the instructions of `Step 2`.
*  **Problem:** Forwading is disabled, and you cannot connect to your router
    *   **Solution:** Enable ip forwarding via `Step 6`.
*   **Problem:** The router is not reachable from other devices in the subnet.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that the other device have configured its IP address with an IP on the same subnet. Verify that the other device does not have a firewall that could be blocking connectivity.
*   **Problem:** Misconfigured firewall rules that block connectivity to the interface.
    *   **Solution:** Check the `/ip firewall filter print` output. Ensure there are no block rules that are being applied that are affecting the connectivity to your device.
*   **Problem:** High CPU usage due to incorrect configurations.
    *   **Solution:** Monitor router performance using `/system resource print`. Review the configuration for any settings which can cause high CPU usage. Ensure there is not a lot of traffic being forwarded across the interface.

## Verification and Testing Steps:

1.  **Ping Test:** From another device within the `136.111.165.0/24` network, ping the IP address of the bridge interface (136.111.165.1):
    ```bash
    ping 136.111.165.1
    ```
    *   **Expected Result:** Successful ping replies.

2.  **Traceroute:** Use traceroute to map the network path.
    ```bash
    traceroute 136.111.165.1
    ```
    *   **Expected Result:** The first hop should be the router's IP.

3.  **MikroTik Torch (Traffic Monitoring):**
     * **Action (CLI)**
    ```mikrotik
    /tool torch interface=bridge-92
    ```
    *   **Action (Winbox):** Go to Tools->Torch, specify the interface you are interested in (`bridge-92`), and then click on `Start`. The window will show all traffic going over this interface.
    *   **Expected Result:** Torch will display traffic flow on the interface, useful for troubleshooting if connectivity fails.

## Related Features and Considerations:

*   **DHCP Server:** For ease of use, add a DHCP server on `bridge-92` to automatically assign IPs.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Set up firewall rules to secure the network and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Static Routes:** If the router needs to connect to networks outside of `136.111.165.0/24`, you'll need to add static routes or use a dynamic routing protocol.
*   **VLANs:** For more complex network segments, consider using VLANs on the bridge.

## Detailed Explanation of Topic:

IP routing is the process of forwarding IP packets from one network to another. A router is responsible for making this routing decision based on the destination IP address of the packet and its routing table. In the context of this document, we created a single local network using the `bridge-92` interface. We assigned an IP address on this interface, so that this router can participate in routing packets. If the router does not have any interfaces connected, then the packets cannot be routed.  In the most basic form, IP routing requires at least 2 network interfaces with a configured IP address and subnet.

## Detailed Explanation of Trade-offs:

The current setup uses a single bridge interface and IP address, this is beneficial for simple point-to-point networks. Here are some trade-offs to consider:

*   **Single Broadcast Domain:** Using a bridge interface creates a single broadcast domain. While simple, this can be a problem in larger networks. You may want to isolate different segments of your network using VLANs or different subnets.
*  **Lack of Redundancy:** This configuration does not have any redundancy. In case the router fails, your whole network will stop working. For increased redundancy, consider multiple routers, and routing protocols.
*  **Scalability:** The current setup is suitable for small scale networks. For large scale networks, it would be better to implement routing protocols, such as OSPF, to manage routes more effectively.
*   **Security:** Security is very basic in this setup. Consider using additional firewall and security features for the sake of your network.
