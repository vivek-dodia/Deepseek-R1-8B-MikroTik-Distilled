**Layer3 Routing with MikroTik RouterOS 6.x**

**Configuration Scenario and Requirements:**

Expert Configuration Level for SOHO Networks

- Multiple VLANs within the network
- Static routing to connect the VLANs
- Firewall rules to control traffic between the VLANs

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**1. VLANs Configuration:**
- Create VLANs using the "Bridge" menu
- Assign the VLANs to the physical interfaces

**2. Static Routing Configuration:**
- Go to "IP" > "Routes"
- Click on "+" button to add a new route
- Provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Destination | Network Address | The subnet you want to route |
| Gateway | IP Address | The next hop gateway for the subnet |
| Distance | 1 | Lower distance indicates a preferred route |

**3. Firewall Rules Configuration:**
- Go to "IP" > "Firewall" > "NAT"
- Click on "+" button to add a new rule
- Provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Chain | dstnat | Destination NAT chain |
| Protocol | All | Matches all protocols |
| Dst. Address | Any | Destination address matches any |
| Dst. Port | Any | Destination port matches any |
| In. Interface | Interface to VLAN 1 | Specifies the interface where the traffic is coming from |
| Action | accept | Allow traffic to pass through |

- Repeat the above step for all other VLANs you want to allow communication with.

**Complete Configuration Commands:**

```
# Create VLANs
/interface bridge add name=VLAN1 vlan-id=1
/interface bridge add name=VLAN2 vlan-id=2

# Assign VLANs to interfaces
/interface bridge port add bridge=VLAN1 interface=ether1
/interface bridge port add bridge=VLAN2 interface=ether2

# Add static routes
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.1.0/24 gateway=192.168.1.1
/ip route add dst-address=192.168.2.0/24 gateway=192.168.2.1

# Add firewall rules
/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat protocol=all dst-address=any dst-port=any in-interface=VLAN1 action=accept
/ip firewall nat add chain=dstnat protocol=all dst-address=any dst-port=any in-interface=VLAN2 action=accept
```

**Common Pitfalls and Solutions:**

* **Wrong VLAN configuration:** Ensure that the VLANs are created correctly and assigned to the appropriate interfaces.
* **Incorrect routes:** Verify that the static routes are configured with the correct subnet and gateway addresses.
* **Firewall rules not applied:** Check that the firewall rules are enabled and applied to the correct interface.

**Verification and Testing Steps:**

* Ping between the VLANs to verify connectivity.
* Use Traceroute to check the routing path.
* Monitor firewall logs to ensure that traffic is being allowed as expected.

**Related Features and Considerations:**

* **BGP Routing:** For more advanced routing capabilities, consider using BGP to dynamically learn routes.
* **Dynamic Routing Protocols (RIP, OSPF):** These protocols can automatically discover and maintain routing tables.
* **Security:** Ensure that the firewall is configured to protect the network from unauthorized access and attacks.
