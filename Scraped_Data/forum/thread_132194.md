Policy routing is only half working - it sort-of works, but seems to be dropping packets or something as it's really slow, with no sign of the CPU being loaded. My backup link is only a 6Mbps/750kbps ADSL, but I want to route my VoIP over it as my primary 350Mbps/20Mbps link is very jittery. I've also set up incoming HTTPS/VPN and SMTP on the backup link; the HTTPS and SMTP are very very slow and the VPN fails.Everything works fine when I pull the primary link though.Both of my WAN links are dynamic, in that one is DHCP (via cable modem) and the other is PPPoE (via DSL modem), could that be causing a problem with my "static" but route-marked routes?Can anyone see where I am going wrong? Here's my /ip firewall:Code:Select allAnd here's my /ip route:Code:Select allUp and running, here's my /ip route print:Code:Select allEdit: It's on an RB3011UiAS with ROS 6.41.3. I can share more of the config if that would help.Edit 2: Yes I know the rule to send the VoIP over route-wan2 is disabled. That's because it doesn't work at all when it's enabled. But I added in testing on the rule called "SSH" which is where my test client is.

Policy routing is incompatible with fasttracking. No packet which needs to be mangled (to get the routing mark assigned), nor any response packet in a connection established by such packet, must matched by the "action=fasttrack" rule, otherwisemost ofthe subsequent packets of the same connection would bypass the mangle table (and several other steps of packet processing too). The fact that only most of, not all, packets of the fasttracked connections are actually fasttracked explains why these connections are slow but not totally dead.So if all connections need to be policy-routed, just remove theCode:Select allrule from theCode:Select alllist, and eventually do some CPU consumption optimization as suggested below.If there are connections which do not need policy routing, you definitely want them to remain fasttracked to save CPU power. In such case, for those connections you want to policy-route, you shouldmark each such connection as a whole on its establishing packet:Code:Select allassign a routing mark to any packet belonging to a marked connection:Code:Select allThis fulfils two goals:you only evaluate all the criteria on the establishing packet of each connection, and then you just assign routing mark based on existing connection mark so the CPU time spent per packet is reducedeven packets belonging to a marked connection which come from WAN side can be matched on connection-mark so you can prevent them from activating fasttracking for the connection easilyNext, you add one ruleCode:Select allper each connection mark you use right before the existingCode:Select allrule inCode:Select all.

Aha! I knew I must be missing something simple and obvious! I turned off that fasttrack forward rule and voilà! Everything worked! Many many thanksIn fact I only want to policy route on WAN2, and (later) traffic shape WAN1 outbound and WAN2 traffic. This works out perfectly. I have changed the fasttrack rule to:Code:Select allso that only inbound traffic on WAN1 - which runs at up to 350Mbps - gets fasttracked; everything else (WAN1 outbound at 20Mbps, WAN2 inbound at 6Mbps, WAN2 outbound at 750kbps) can go the "slow" CPU-bound route, which the RB3011's dual-core 1.4GHz processor should handle without breaking sweat.Many thanks again.
