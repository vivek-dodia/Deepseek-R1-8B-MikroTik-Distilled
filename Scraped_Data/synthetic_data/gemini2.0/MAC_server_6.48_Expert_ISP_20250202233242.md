**1. Configuration Scenario and Requirements**

In this scenario, we will configure a MikroTik RouterOS 6.48 device to act as a MAC server. The MAC server will be responsible for managing MAC addresses and IP addresses, ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network.

**2. Step-by-Step Implementation**

**2.1 Enable MAC Server**

- Go to **IP > MAC Server** and click on the **Plus** button.
- Set **Name** to identify the MAC server.
- Select **Enable** to activate the MAC server.

**2.2 Configure MAC Address Binding**

- Click on the **Bindings** tab.
- Click on the **Plus** button to add a new MAC address binding.
- Enter the **MAC Address** of the device you want to authorize.
- Enter the **IP Address** you want to assign to the device.
- Click **Apply** to save the binding.

**2.3 Configure DHCP Server**

To automatically assign IP addresses to authorized devices, we need to configure a DHCP server.

- Go to **IP > DHCP Server** and click on the **Plus** button.
- Set **Interface** to the interface that will be used for DHCP.
- Set **Address Pool** to the range of IP addresses that will be assigned to clients.
- Set **MAC Server** to the name of the MAC server you created in step 2.1.
- Click **Apply** to save the DHCP server configuration.

**3. Complete Configuration Commands**

```
/ip mac-server enable {name=<MAC_server_name>}
/ip mac-server binding add src-address=<MAC_address> address=<IP_address>
/ip dhcp-server add interface=<Interface_name> address-pool=<IP_address_pool> mac-server=<MAC_server_name>
```

**4. Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

- Ensure that the MAC addresses you bind are correct and belong to devices on the network.
- Verify that the DHCP server is properly configured and has a valid address pool.
- Check that the interface you selected for DHCP is correct and has connectivity.
- If devices are not getting IP addresses, ensure that the DHCP client is enabled on the device.

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

- Connect authorized devices to the network.
- Check if they are assigned IP addresses from the specified DHCP pool.
- Test network connectivity by pinging other devices on the network.

**6. Related Features and Considerations**

- **IPFiltering:** You can use IP filtering rules to restrict access to the network based on MAC addresses.
- **Hotspot:** You can integrate the MAC server with a Hotspot to manage user authentication and authorization.
- **Bridge:** The MAC server can work with bridges to manage MAC addresses on bridged interfaces.

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

**Get MAC Server Configuration:**

```
GET /ip/mac-server/print
```

**Create a MAC Address Binding:**

```
POST /ip/mac-server/binding/add
{
  "mac-address": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
  "address": "192.168.1.10"
}
```

**Create a DHCP Server:**

```
POST /ip/dhcp-server/add
{
  "name": "DHCP1",
  "interface": "bridge1",
  "address-pool": {
    "range": ["192.168.1.100", "192.168.1.150"]
  },
  "mac-server": "MAC-Server1"
}
```
