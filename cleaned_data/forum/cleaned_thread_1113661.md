## Initial Question
MorningI have a CCR2216 on ROS 7.16.2When I upgraded from 7.16.1 to 7.16.2 my OSPF sessions was not working. I disabled L3 HW offloading and OSPF came up again.After a few days I turned L3HW offloading on again and last night my OSPF sessions between edge and other routers was down again. If I look at the log there is an improper shutdown because of kernel failures.When I disabled L3HW offloading, OSPF came up again. I rebooted router again. I have logged a ticket with Support now as well.Has anybody else had this? ---
