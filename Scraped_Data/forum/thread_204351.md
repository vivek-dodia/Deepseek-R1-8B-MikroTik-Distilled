Goodmorning,after generate a backup with my MacOS terminal, via SSH[admin@MikroTik] > /system backup save name=test password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>Configuration backup savedI would like to retrieve it, from the Router.A gentlemen on this forum, told me to use it Netinsall, and it work fine; BUT I do have MacBook,and to get Netinstall working I do need to use a Windows PC and the router connected via ETH Cable.Is there any command, via terminal (SSH) that allow me to download files from the Router ?For example, /file print, list me all the available files, is there a command like /file download name=test or /file get name=test ? (GET do something, but I believe not exactly what I'm looking for)Model			RBwAPGR-5HacD2HnDRevision		        r3Firmware Typ  	ipq4000LCurrent Firmware	6.49.12Thank again for your support and endurance
