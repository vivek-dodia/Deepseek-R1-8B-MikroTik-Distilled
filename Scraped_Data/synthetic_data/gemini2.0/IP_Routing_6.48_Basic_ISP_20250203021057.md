Okay, let's delve into this comprehensive MikroTik documentation for your ISP scenario. This is going to be extensive, so I'll break it down into sections and focus on your request for routing, but will also cover other requested topics.  We'll build up the configuration and provide detailed explanations along the way.

**Comprehensive Scenario: ISP Routing Implementation**

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

**Scenario:** An ISP needs to route a subnet `121.197.104.0/24` out a specific interface `ether-65`. This subnet is connected to a downstream network (e.g., customer network) and needs to be routed via the designated interface.  This interface is used to connect a customer's network to the ISP’s network.

**MikroTik Requirements:**
*   **RouterOS Version:** 6.48 (Target, applicable to 7.x as well)
*   **Configuration Level:** Basic configuration with some Advanced insights.
*   **Network Scale:** ISP
*   **Interface:** `ether-65`
*   **Subnet:** `121.197.104.0/24`
*   **Routing Goal:** Ensure any traffic destined to the subnet `121.197.104.0/24` will go out the `ether-65` interface.
*   **Security:** Implement basic security best practices by restricting access to the router from the given subnet, ensuring no routing of other traffic.
*   **Monitoring:** Basic monitoring setup is also needed to allow easy troubleshooting

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation (CLI and Winbox)**

**Step 1: Interface Configuration**

*   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
    /interface ethernet
    set ether-65 name="customer-eth65"
    ```
*   **Winbox:** Navigate to `Interfaces`. Locate `ether-65`, double-click it, and rename it to `customer-eth65`.

**Step 2: IP Address Assignment**

*   **CLI:** Assign an IP address to the interface (note: within the ISP's network and not 121.197.104.0/24). We will use an IP address in an ISP's private range and not the specific 121.197.104.0/24 subnet to avoid conflict. We assume the ISP uses 10.0.0.0/8 address range
    ```mikrotik
    /ip address
    add address=10.20.30.1/30 interface=customer-eth65 network=10.20.30.0
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   `address=10.20.30.1/30`:  Assigns the IP address `10.20.30.1` with a `/30` subnet mask to the interface. This IP address should be part of the same network as the remote end, on the other side of the `ether-65` interface.
    *   `interface=customer-eth65`: Specifies that this IP address is associated with the `customer-eth65` interface.
    *   `network=10.20.30.0`: Specifies the network ID for this IP range. This is important for routing table calculations

*   **Winbox:** Navigate to `IP` -> `Addresses`. Click the `+` button, add the above parameters, and then click `Apply`.

**Step 3: Static Route Configuration**

*   **CLI:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip route
    add dst-address=121.197.104.0/24 gateway=10.20.30.2  distance=1
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *  `dst-address=121.197.104.0/24`: Specifies the destination network as `121.197.104.0/24`.
    *  `gateway=10.20.30.2`: Sets the next hop IP address to `10.20.30.2`, which is assumed to be on the other side of the customer's router connected on `ether-65` (or `customer-eth65`).
    *  `distance=1`: Specifies the administrative distance for this route. A lower value makes the route more preferred.

*   **Winbox:** Navigate to `IP` -> `Routes`. Click the `+` button, and then input the values, and click `Apply`.

**Step 4: Firewall Configuration (Basic Security)**

*   **CLI:**
   ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input comment="Allow Established Connections" connection-state=established,related action=accept
    add chain=input comment="Accept Input from LAN (Management)" src-address=10.20.30.0/30  action=accept
    add chain=input comment="Drop Invalid Connections" connection-state=invalid action=drop
    add chain=input comment="Drop everything else" action=drop
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   We allow established and related connections to avoid breaking existing services.
    *   We allow management traffic from the local network where the `customer-eth65` interface is configured.
    *   We drop invalid traffic.
    *   Finally, we drop everything else to avoid random attacks.

*   **Winbox:** Navigate to `IP` -> `Firewall` -> `Filter Rules`. Click the `+` button to add rules using the above configurations.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**
   ```mikrotik
   /interface ethernet
   set ether-65 name="customer-eth65"

   /ip address
   add address=10.20.30.1/30 interface=customer-eth65 network=10.20.30.0

   /ip route
   add dst-address=121.197.104.0/24 gateway=10.20.30.2 distance=1

   /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input comment="Allow Established Connections" connection-state=established,related action=accept
    add chain=input comment="Accept Input from LAN (Management)" src-address=10.20.30.0/30  action=accept
    add chain=input comment="Drop Invalid Connections" connection-state=invalid action=drop
    add chain=input comment="Drop everything else" action=drop
   ```

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect interface name.
    *   **Error Scenario:** If the interface name in the IP address or route configuration is wrong, the traffic won't go through the desired path.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/interface print` to check interface names, double-check typing, and ensure it matches the physical interface.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect IP address/subnet masks.
    *   **Error Scenario:** Communication will fail if IP addresses, network address, and subnet masks are incorrect.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check `/ip address print`, verify address, subnet, network, and interface.
*   **Pitfall:** Incorrect Gateway Address.
    *   **Error Scenario:** Route will be ineffective or will lead to the wrong network, causing packets to be dropped.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Verify that the gateway is reachable on the target interface.
*  **Pitfall:** Firewall blocking traffic
   *   **Error Scenario:** The firewall rules can block the traffic if they are not properly configured.
   *   **Troubleshooting:** Check firewall rules, and allow traffic to the correct ports and destination.
*   **MikroTik Diagnostics:**
    *   **Ping:** `/ping 121.197.104.1` (or any address on the target network) to test connectivity.
    *   **Traceroute:** `/tool traceroute 121.197.104.1` to trace path of traffic.
    *   **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=customer-eth65` to see real-time traffic on the interface.
    *   **Log:** `/log print` to see logs of activities and errors.

**5. Verification and Testing**

*   **Ping:**
    *   From a machine in the 121.197.104.0/24 network, try pinging an IP address on the router in a different network.
    *   From the router, ping an IP on the 121.197.104.0/24 network.
*   **Traceroute:** Use traceroute from the router to an IP in the 121.197.104.0/24 network to ensure the route is followed.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding):** For more advanced setups, if you had multiple customers using the same subnet, you would use VRF to isolate their traffic.
*   **Policy Based Routing (PBR):** Useful for complex routing rules, e.g., sending traffic from certain source IPs out a different interface.
*   **Limitations:** Basic static routes don’t adapt to network failures. For dynamic routing, you would use routing protocols such as OSPF or BGP.
*   **Less Common Scenario:** Using `dst-address-list` in route table to group multiple network routes, or using `routing-mark` for policy based routing.

**8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **IP Addressing:** RouterOS uses standard IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes. An interface needs an IP address within a subnet to participate in IP routing.
*   **IP Pools:** Used to allocate IP addresses dynamically, typically for DHCP servers.
*   **IP Routing:** MikroTik uses static routing (manual route configuration) and dynamic routing protocols to determine paths for packets. Each route entry contains a destination network, a next-hop gateway, and an administrative distance.
*   **IP Settings:** Includes options for settings such as MTU, TCP settings, etc.
*   **Bridging:** Used to forward frames at Layer 2.
*   **Switching:** RouterOS can act as a Layer 2 switch using its hardware switch chip.
*   **Firewall:** RouterOS firewalls are stateful. Firewall rules are checked on the packet's ingress, and a matching rule determines if the packet is accepted or dropped.

**9. Security Best Practices Specific to MikroTik Routers**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use complex, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
*   **Restrict Access:** Only allow access to the router from trusted IPs. Use firewall rules to block access from untrusted networks.
*   **Disable Unused Services:**  Disable unnecessary services to reduce your attack surface.
*   **Keep RouterOS Updated:**  Install the latest version of RouterOS and RouterBOOT to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure API Access:**  Use HTTPS for API access and disable unauthenticated access.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor logs to identify security incidents.
*   **Disable Default Accounts:** Remove the default admin user and create unique user credentials.
*   **Limit API Access:** Use different users with restricted permission for accessing the API.
