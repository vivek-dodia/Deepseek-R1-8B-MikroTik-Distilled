## Initial Question
Hi everyone, I recently updated to RouterOS 7.16 and noticed in the changelog that ZeroTier is supposedly upgraded to version 1.14. However, in the ZeroTier web interface, it still shows version 1.10.3. I'm a bit confused about which version is actually running on my router.Could someone clarify why the web interface is reporting an older version, while the 7.16 release notes indicate a newer version? Is there something I need to enable or configure, or is this simply a display issue?Thanks in advance for any insights!Best regards, Hagelsturm ---
