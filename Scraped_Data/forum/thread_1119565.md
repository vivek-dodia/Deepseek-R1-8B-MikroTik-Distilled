I'm adding RB5009U to hAP ax3 and CRS3xx fleet.Bridge VLAN Filtering for multiple VLAN/subnets is working; no switching issuesIPv4/IPv6 routing and firewall are working; RouterOS package upgrades work.hAP ax3 has WAN interface; all RB5009U ports are on default bridge.All RB5009U interfaces are in WAN interface list; no WAN interface.Both devices can ping *.pool.ntp.org hosts.All IPv4 LAN subnets are private.hAP ax3 NTP diagnostics:Code:Select all[admin@mtc53uiga]>/system/ntp/client/exportterse;/system/ntp/client/printwithout-paging# 2025-01-16 10:06:59 by RouterOS 7.16.2# software id = KQPZ-KUKS## model = C53UiG+5HPaxD2HPaxD# serial number = xxxxxx/system ntp clientsetenabled=yes/system ntp client serversaddaddress=0.pool.ntp.org/system ntp client serversaddaddress=1.pool.ntp.org/system ntp client serversaddaddress=2.pool.ntp.org/system ntp client serversaddaddress=3.pool.ntp.org

I observed similar issue but with time.google.com. I switched to other set of NTP servers for MikroTik devices and had no issues since. I also confirmed that while this is happening, I am able to query this NTP server from other devices with no issues.Does NTP client require a public IPv4 address?It does not.

Bah, humbug! Works when after adding default gateway IP address (hAP ax3 running NTP server). Good enough to move forward.You know, I should disable the firewall since I just presumed it was not in play. Thanks for the reply, helps the mind work here.

Well, now I know disabling every firewall rule has no effect.
