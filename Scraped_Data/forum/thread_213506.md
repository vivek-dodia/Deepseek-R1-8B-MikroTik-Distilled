Up.Also, is there a more official forum for feature requests? I don't want to submit a service ticket just for a wishlist item.If you go to help.mikrotik.com, there is a category for feature requests.  Stuff like adding a setting like MTU on VETH seems like a fair request.

I just noticed. I guess container development on routers is a recent thing. Using a mtu 1500 in an environment that should be similar to a loopback is not what I expected.
