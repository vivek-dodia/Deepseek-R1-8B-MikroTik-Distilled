Okay, let's dive deep into configuring a MikroTik router, specifically focusing on IP addressing and related topics within the context of an ISP network environment. This document will cover a wide range of MikroTik features and concepts, structured as per your detailed requirements.

**1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario and Specific MikroTik Requirements**

*   **Scenario:** We will configure a MikroTik router (running RouterOS 6.48 or 7.x) to serve as an edge router for a small ISP. The router will have one internal interface (`bridge-24`) connected to the ISP's network using IPv4. We will also discuss IPv6 considerations.
*   **Subnet:** The internal network will use the subnet `179.200.211.0/24`.
*   **Interface:** The internal network will be connected to a bridge interface named `bridge-24`.
*   **Configuration Level:** This guide aims for a basic to advanced configuration, suitable for ISPs handling a moderate number of clients.
*   **Network Scale:** ISP.

**2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation**

We will start by configuring the basic IPv4 addressing on the `bridge-24` interface, and then expand to other features.

**2.1 Initial Setup**

*   **Assumptions:** You have a MikroTik router and have basic access using Winbox or SSH. You are logged in as an admin user.
*   **Step 1: Access your MikroTik Router** Access your Router via Winbox, WebFig or SSH.
*   **Step 2: Configure the `bridge-24` interface.**
    *   Create the bridge interface using CLI:
       ```mikrotik
       /interface bridge
       add name=bridge-24
       ```
    *   Add the ports that should be connected to the local network using CLI. In this example we assume that interface `ether2` should be connected to the local network:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface bridge port
        add bridge=bridge-24 interface=ether2
        ```
        *Note that multiple interfaces can be added to the same bridge*
    *   Assign an IP address to `bridge-24` using CLI:
       ```mikrotik
       /ip address
       add address=179.200.211.1/24 interface=bridge-24
       ```
        **Explanation:**  
        * `/ip address add`: This is the MikroTik command to add a new IP address configuration.
        * `address=179.200.211.1/24`: Specifies the IPv4 address and the network mask (24-bit netmask = 255.255.255.0).
        * `interface=bridge-24`: Specifies which interface the IP address is assigned to.

*   **Step 3: Verify the IP address configuration:**
    *   You can verify via CLI:
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address print
        ```
    *   Alternatively via Winbox, you can navigate to **IP > Addresses** and review the configured interfaces.

**2.2 Basic IPv6 Configuration (Optional)**

*   **Step 1: Enable IPv6:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 settings set disable-ipv6=no
    ```
*   **Step 2: Assign an IPv6 address to `bridge-24`.**  We will use a Unique Local Address (ULA) prefix in this example. Replace `fd00:1234:5678::/48` with your own ULA range.
    ```mikrotik
    /ipv6 address
    add address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64 interface=bridge-24
    ```
    **Explanation:**  
    * `/ipv6 address add`: Similar to IPv4, this command adds an IPv6 address.
    * `address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64`: The IPv6 address and the network prefix length.
    * `interface=bridge-24`: The interface for the address.

**3. Complete MikroTik CLI Configuration Commands**

Here's the complete CLI configuration for the initial setup:

```mikrotik
/interface bridge
add name=bridge-24

/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge-24 interface=ether2

/ip address
add address=179.200.211.1/24 interface=bridge-24

/ipv6 settings
set disable-ipv6=no

/ipv6 address
add address=fd00:1234:5678::1/64 interface=bridge-24
```

**4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics**

*   **Pitfall 1: Incorrect Interface Assignment:** If you assign an IP address to the wrong interface, devices on your network won't be able to reach the router.
    *   **Error Scenario:** No connectivity, devices can't ping `179.200.211.1`.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip address print` to check the interfaces. Double-check your bridge and port configurations.
*   **Pitfall 2: Overlapping Subnets:** Ensure that there are no other devices with the same IP address range.
    *   **Error Scenario:** IP address conflicts, inconsistent network behavior.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Use `/ip neighbor print` to discover devices on the network.  Use `ping 179.200.211.1` to verify connectivity to the router interface.
*   **Pitfall 3: Bridge Misconfiguration:**  Forgetting to add interfaces to the bridge will result in them not being part of the bridged network.
    *   **Error Scenario:** Clients connected to interfaces on the router other than the ones connected to the bridge cannot communicate.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Ensure that all required ports are connected to the bridge, using `/interface bridge port print`.
*  **Pitfall 4: IPv6 Routing:** If you want IPv6 connectivity past the router you will also need to configure a route.
     *   **Error Scenario:** Clients can obtain an IPv6 address but cannot connect to the internet.
     *   **Troubleshooting:** Ensure that a default IPv6 route is present, using `/ipv6 route print`.
* **Diagnostics Tools**
    * **`ping`:** `ping 179.200.211.1` to check IP connectivity of the router itself. Ping any devices on the local network.
    * **`traceroute`:** `traceroute 179.200.211.254` to trace routes on local networks.
    * **`torch`:** `/tool torch interface=bridge-24` to view real-time traffic flowing through the interface.
    * **`/ip neighbor print`:** To show all active neighbors connected to the device

**5. Verification and Testing Steps**

*   **Ping Test:**
    *   Connect a device to `bridge-24` (or a port on the bridge). Assign it an IP in the `179.200.211.0/24` network (e.g., `179.200.211.2/24`).
    *   From the device, ping the router's IP: `ping 179.200.211.1`.
    *   From the router, ping a device on the local network `ping 179.200.211.2`
    *   If the ping is successful, connectivity is established.
*   **IPv6 Test (if configured):**
    *   From the client device, ping the IPv6 address of the bridge-24 `ping fd00:1234:5678::1`.
    *   From the router, ping an IPv6 address from the client device
    *   If configured correctly this will indicate that IPv6 is working as expected.
*   **Winbox Interface Monitoring:**
    *   Observe traffic on the interface using Winbox. Navigate to **Interfaces**, select `bridge-24`, and look at the "RX/TX" counters.

**6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations**

*   **IP Pools:** For dynamic IP assignments, we can use IP pools:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip pool
    add name=isp-pool ranges=179.200.211.100-179.200.211.200
    ```
    This creates a pool of IP addresses that could be used by DHCP server
*   **DHCP Server:**
    ```mikrotik
    /ip dhcp-server
    add address-pool=isp-pool interface=bridge-24 lease-time=1d name=dhcp-isp
    /ip dhcp-server network
    add address=179.200.211.0/24 dns-server=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8 gateway=179.200.211.1
    ```
    This configures a DHCP server on the bridge-24 interface, using the defined IP Pool
*   **MAC server:** Can be used for troubleshooting connectivity. Use the `mac-winbox` and `mac-telnet` services to connect to your router even if the IP configuration is missing or incorrect.
    ```mikrotik
    /tool mac-server set allowed-interface-list=bridge-24
    /tool mac-server enable
    /tool mac-server mac-winbox set allowed-interface-list=bridge-24

**7. MikroTik REST API Examples**

MikroTik's REST API is powerful but requires a bit more setup than the CLI. Here are a few examples:

**7.1 Prerequisites:**
*  Ensure API is enabled (`/ip service set api enabled=yes`). You may need to set up a specific IP address for access if you don't want the API to be globally exposed.
* You must have a user/pass for api authentication.

**7.2 Example 1: Get all IP Addresses**

*   **Endpoint:** `https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Request (Headers):** Provide basic authentication header with your username and password
*   **Example cURL request (replace <router-ip>, <user> and <password>):**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u <user>:<password> "https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address"
    ```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    [
        {
            ".id": "*1",
            "address": "179.200.211.1/24",
            "interface": "bridge-24",
            "version": "4",
            "actual-interface": "bridge-24",
            "dynamic": "false",
            "invalid": "false"
         },
        {
            ".id": "*2",
             "address": "fd00:1234:5678::1/64",
             "interface": "bridge-24",
             "version": "6",
            "actual-interface": "bridge-24",
            "dynamic": "false",
            "invalid": "false"
         }
    ]
    ```

**7.3 Example 2: Adding a New IP Address**

*   **Endpoint:** `https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request (Headers):** Content-Type: `application/json`, Basic Authentication header.
*   **Example cURL request (replace <router-ip>, <user> and <password>):**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u <user>:<password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"address":"179.200.211.2/24", "interface":"bridge-24"}' "https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address"
    ```
*   **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "message": "added",
        "id": "*3"
    }
    ```

**7.4 Example 3: Deleting an IP Address**

*  **Endpoint:** `https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address/<.id>`
*   **Method:** `DELETE`
*   **Request (Headers):** Basic Authentication Header
*   **Example cURL request (replace <router-ip>, <user>, <password> and id):**
    ```bash
    curl -k -u <user>:<password> -X DELETE "https://<your-router-ip>/rest/ip/address/*3"
    ```
*  **Expected Response (JSON):**
    ```json
        {
          "message": "removed"
         }
    ```

**Note:** The actual JSON might differ slightly depending on the RouterOS version. Remember that the REST API access needs to be secured to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**8. In-depth Explanations of Core Concepts**

*   **Bridging:** MikroTik's bridging functionality combines multiple interfaces into a single layer-2 domain. This allows devices on different physical ports to communicate as if they were all connected to a single switch. The router bridges ethernet ports together and then treats the bridge interface as the network facing interface.
*   **Routing:** MikroTik routers use routing tables to determine the next hop for network traffic. This is how traffic flows between subnets and to other networks like the internet. Routing is needed to direct traffic to devices not directly connected to the router.
*   **Firewall:** The firewall controls traffic flow based on pre-defined rules. MikroTik's firewall is stateful, meaning it tracks connections, allowing for more complex and secure traffic control. The Firewall filters traffic between different interfaces based on specified rules.
*   **IP Addressing:** IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are numerical labels that identify devices on a network. We used static addressing, but DHCP is usually used for clients.
*   **IP Pools:** Pools of IP addresses that can be allocated to devices. It is used by the DHCP server.

**9. Security Best Practices**

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. This is paramount for security.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable services like `telnet` and the API unless needed. This limits attack vectors. Use `/ip service print` to show all enabled services.
*  **Firewall Rules:** Implement a robust firewall to restrict access from unauthorized networks. At minimum add rules to block incoming traffic on the internet interface.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep RouterOS updated to the latest stable version to patch any security vulnerabilities. Use `/system package update print` and `/system package update install` to check and install updates.
*  **Secure API Access:**  Restrict access to the REST API to only trusted IP addresses, and always use strong credentials. Only enable the API if it is necessary.
*  **Use SSH:** Always prefer SSH over telnet for remote access.
*  **Limit Winbox Access:** Restrict Winbox access to trusted networks.
*  **Review Logs:** Review the system log for suspicious activities using `/system logging print`.
*  **Limit MAC Server Usage:** If you use MAC-Server it should only be active when needed.

**10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples**

Here are some examples related to the topics you requested:

**10.1 IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)**
   - We already covered the basic examples in the main guide, but here are a few more examples:

     - **Setting a static IP on an interface:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip address
        add address=192.168.1.100/24 interface=ether1
        ```
     - **Adding multiple IPv6 Addresses to an interface:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 address
        add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=ether1
        add address=2001:db8:1::1/64 interface=ether1
        ```
     - **Setting an IPv6 Link-Local address:**
       ```mikrotik
        /ipv6 address
        add address=fe80::1/64 interface=ether1
       ```
  - **Tradeoffs**
    - *Static vs Dynamic IP*: Static IPs are best for fixed equipment that needs to be accessed at the same address, while dynamic IPs are better for the average user because the IP is allocated automatically by a DHCP server.

**10.2 IP Pools**

    - See section 6 for example usage.

**10.3 IP Routing**

   - **Adding a default IPv4 gateway:**
     ```mikrotik
     /ip route
     add dst-address=0.0.0.0/0 gateway=192.168.1.1
     ```
   - **Adding a default IPv6 gateway:**
      ```mikrotik
      /ipv6 route
      add dst-address=::/0 gateway=2001:db8::1
      ```
   - **Adding a static route to a specific network:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip route
        add dst-address=10.0.0.0/24 gateway=192.168.1.2
        ```
    - **Tradeoffs**
        - *Static routing vs dynamic routing:* Static routes are useful for basic networks and routes that should not change, while dynamic routing allows for automatic discovery of routes through protocols such as OSPF and BGP.

**10.4 IP Settings**
    - **Example:**
        ```mikrotik
        /ip settings
        set tcp-syncookies=yes allow-fast-path=yes
        ```

**10.5 MAC Server**
  - See section 6 for an example.

**10.6 RoMON**
  - See section 6 for an example.

**10.7 WinBox**
   - Winbox is a GUI tool for configuring Mikrotik routers, and is recommended for beginners.

**10.8 Certificates**
  - We already discussed this in section 6

**10.9 PPP AAA**

    - **Example:** Setting up a PPPoE server:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface pppoe-server server
         add interface=bridge-24 service-name=pppoe-isp max-mtu=1492 max-mru=1492
        ```

**10.10 RADIUS**

    - **Example:** Setting up a RADIUS server for PPP authentication
        ```mikrotik
        /radius add address=192.168.1.100 secret=your-secret service=ppp timeout=300ms
         /ppp aaa
         set use-radius=yes accounting=yes interim-update=10m
         ```

**10.11 User / User groups**

    - **Example:** Creating a new admin user:
        ```mikrotik
        /user add name=newadmin password=newpassword group=full
        ```
    - **Example:** Creating a user group and configuring permissions:
        ```mikrotik
        /user group add name=limited access=read
        /user add name=limiteduser password=user group=limited
        ```

**10.12 Bridging and Switching**

    - Already covered in the main guide.
    - **Tradeoffs**
        - *Software bridge vs hardware switch:* Hardware switching performs much better than bridging. Use hardware switching wherever possible.

**10.13 MACVLAN**

    - **Example:** Create a MACVLAN on ether1:
      ```mikrotik
      /interface macvlan
      add interface=ether1 mac-address=02:00:00:00:00:01 name=macvlan1
      ```

**10.14 L3 Hardware Offloading**
   -  See section 6

**10.15 MACsec**
   - **Example**:
    ```mikrotik
    /interface macsec
    add interface=ether2 key=6162636465666768696A6B6C6D6E6F70 name=macsec1
    ```

**10.16 Quality of Service**

    - **Example:** Simple queue for limiting bandwidth:
        ```mikrotik
        /queue simple add target=179.200.211.0/24 max-limit=10M/10M
        ```
    - **Example:** Configuring HTB queues:
        ```mikrotik
       /queue type
       add kind=pcq-upload name=pcq-upload-default pcq-rate=1M pcq-limit=50
       add kind=pcq-download name=pcq-download-default pcq-rate=1M pcq-limit=50
       /queue tree
       add name="upload" parent=global-out queue=pcq-upload-default
       add name="download" parent=global-in queue=pcq-download-default
      ```
    - **Tradeoffs:**
        -  *Simple queues vs HTB queues:* HTB queues are more flexible and offer more advanced control, while simple queues are easier to configure and maintain. HTB is more performant on higher bandwidth scenarios.

**10.17 Switch Chip Features**

   -  Some RouterOS devices have more advanced switch chip functionality.
   -  These features are chip-specific, but an example might be a VLAN configuration:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface ethernet switch vlan
        add vlan-id=10 ports=ether2,ether3
        /interface ethernet switch egress-vlan-tag
        add tagged-ports=ether2 vlan-id=10
         ```

**10.18 VLAN**
  - **Example**:
    ```mikrotik
        /interface vlan
         add interface=bridge-24 name=vlan100 vlan-id=100
    ```

**10.19 VXLAN**

    - **Example:** Setting up a VXLAN tunnel:
        ```mikrotik
        /interface vxlan add name=vxlan1 vni=1000 remote-address=192.168.2.1
         ```

**10.20 Firewall and Quality of Service**

    - **Example:** Basic firewall rule to drop incoming connections on internet interface:
    ```mikrotik
    /ip firewall filter
    add chain=input in-interface=ether1 connection-state=new action=drop
    ```
    -  **Example:** NAT configuration to allow access to local network:
       ```mikrotik
       /ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=ether1 action=masquerade
       ```
    -   **Connection Tracking:** Automatic stateful tracking of connections is enabled by default.
        - To see active connection, use `/ip firewall connection print`.
    - **Packet Flow:** When a packet enters a MikroTik RouterOS device, it passes through stages of processing. Input firewall, routing, output firewall, NAT, queues.
    -   **Queues:** See the QoS section above for examples.
    - **Kid Control:** MikroTik allows for scheduling internet access to children, by using firewall rules and schedules.
    -   **UPnP:** MikroTik supports UPnP, which allows clients to automatically forward ports.
    -   **NAT-PMP:**  Similar to UPnP, but used by Apple devices.
    -   **Tradeoffs**
         -  *NAT vs non-NAT*: NAT provides network address translation, which allows many devices to share one IP address, but this limits connection access from the outside.

**10.21 IP Services (DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy)**

    -  **DHCP Server** examples already given.
    - **DNS Server** Example
        ```mikrotik
