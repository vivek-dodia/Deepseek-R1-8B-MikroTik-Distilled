# Introduction
Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up that connection.
NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way.
Because of connection tracking you can use stateful firewall functionality even with stateless protocols such as UDP.
Firewall features affected by connection tracking:
List of tracked connections can be seen in/ip firewall connectionfor IPv4 and/ipv6firewall connectionfor IPv6.

# Connection states
Based on connection table entries arrived packet can get assigned one of the connection states:new, invalid, established, related,oruntracked.
There are two different methods when the packet is considerednew. The first one is in the case of stateless connections (like UDP) when there is no connection entry in the connection table. The other one is in the case of a stateful protocol (TCP). In this case, a new packet that starts a new connection is always a TCP packet with anSYNflag.
If a packet is not new it can belong to either anestablishedorrelatedconnection or not belong to any connection making itinvalid. A packet with anestablishedstate, as most of you already guessed, belongs to an existing connection from the connection tracking table. Arelatedstate is very similar, except that the packet belongs to a connection that is related to one of the existing connections, for example, ICMP error packets or FTP data connection packets.
Connection statenotrackis a special case whenRAWfirewall rules are used to exclude connection from connection tracking. This rule would make all forwarded traffic bypass the connection tracking, improving packet processing speed through the device.
Any other packet is consideredinvalidand in most cases should be dropped.
Based on this information we can set a basic set of filter rules to speed up packet filtering and reduce the load on the CPU by acceptingestablished/relatedpackets, droppinginvalidpackets, and working on more detailed filtering only fornewpackets.
```
ip firewall filter
add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop comment="Drop Invalid connections"
add chain=input connection-state=established,related,untracked action=accept comment="Allow Established/Related/Untracked connections
```
# FastTrack
IPv4 FastTrack is a special handler that bypasses Linux facilities allowing for faster packet forwarding. The handler is used forTCPandUDPconnections marked with "fasttrack-connection" action. IPv4 FastTrack handler supports NAT (SNAT, DNAT, or both).
```
fasttrack-connection
```
Note that not all packets of the connection can be FastTracked, so it is likely to see some packets going through a slow path even though the connection is marked for FastTrack. This is the reason whyfasttrack-connectionis usually followed by an identical "action=accept" rule.
```
action=accept
```
FastTrack-ed packets are bypassing:
It is up to the administrator to make sure FastTrack does not interfere with other configuration.
# Requirements
IPv4 FastTrack is active if the following conditions are met:
# Example
For example, for SOHO routers with factory default configuration, you could FastTrack all LAN traffic with this one rule placed at the top of the Firewall Filter. The same configuration accept rule is required:
```
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=fasttrack-connection connection-state=established,related
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward action=accept connection-state=established,related
```
# Connection tracking settings
Connection tracking settings are managed from/ip firewall connection trackingmenu.

# Properties
Property | Description
----------------------
enabled(yes | no | auto; Default:auto) | Allows to disable or enable connection tracking. With disabled connection tracking Â firewall features listed above will stop working. If set to "auto" connection tracking is disabled until at least one firewall rule is added.
loose-tcp-tracking(yes; Default:yes) | In case loose-tcp-tracking=yes, the 2nd part (SYN,ACK) and 3rd part (ACK) of the handshake without having seen the first initial SYN will be considered ESTABLISHEDIn case loose-tcp-tracking=no, the 2nd part (SYN,ACK) and 3rd part (ACK) without having seen the first initial SYN will be considered INVALID
tcp-syn-sent-timeout(time; Default:5s) | TCP SYN timeout.
tcp-syn-received-timeout(time; Default:5s) | TCP SYN timeout.
tcp-established-timeout(time; Default:1d) | Time after which established TCP connection times out.
tcp-fin-wait-timeout(time; Default:10s) |
tcp-close-wait-timeout(time; Default:10s) |
tcp-last-ack-timeout(time; Default:10s) |
tcp-time-wait-timeout(time; Default:10s) |
tcp-close-timeout(time; Default:10s) |
udp-timeout(time; Default:30s) | Specifies the timeout for UDP connections that have seen packets in one direction
udp-stream-timeout(time; Default:3m) | Specifies the timeout of UDP connections that have seen packets in both directions

Read-only properties
Property | Description
----------------------
max-entries(integer) | Max amount of entries that the connection tracking table can hold. This value depends on the installed amount of RAM.Note that the system does not create a maximum-size connection tracking table when it starts, it may increase if the situation demands it and the system still has free RAM, but the size will not exceed 1048576
total-entries(integer) | Amount of connections that the connection table currently holds
Max amount of entries that the connection tracking table can hold. This value depends on the installed amount of RAM.
Note that the system does not create a maximum-size connection tracking table when it starts, it may increase if the situation demands it and the system still has free RAM, but the size will not exceed 1048576
