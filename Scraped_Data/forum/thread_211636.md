So, as next step I tried to ping a public IP address from the MikroTik CLI, but it gives timeoutHmm. what to do now?IP doesn't work ?And you are sure about the IP address ? I always use as test 8.8.8.8 (= Google DNS)What do you have as route ?Should be something like 0.0.0.0/0 and gateway lte1Yes, pinging a public IP like 8.8.8.8 gives error "timeout"./ip route print shows something like this (I cannot do copy-paste, rather have to read from the screen):Code:Select all

Yes, pinging a public IP like 8.8.8.8 gives error "timeout".So it is not a missing route the issue (otherwise you would have "no route to host").Have you configured (properly) the APN?It depends on the ISP that issued the SIM, some work just nicely with the automatic APN (that the SIM provides) some need to have it set manually,AND, if you need to set it manually, you MUST disable the "use network APN" otherwise the one you typed in will be ignored.The ISP says the SIM can be used with any LTE router, it has even the PIN deactivated by default.I would of course prefer an auto-setup over a manual one.So, when I call the SIM provider, what should I ask them?Code:Select all

The APN, then if needed username, password, etc.It depends on the SIM, it could be "internet" or "internet.telekom" or "internet.v6.telekom":https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/mobilfunk/ ... ndards/apnSee also this:viewtopic.php?t=183528Check:/interface lte print/interface lte apn print

Forum veteran with 800+ posts can not figure this out? How is that even possible?Just setting up the device and then doing something else in the next 3 or 5 years...Anyway.. you have to decide if you want your router to handle DNS requests or if clients should connect directly to public DNS servers.If you want your router to be midleman, you have to enableallow-remote-requestsin DNSif you want to skip that, you can change settings of your DHCP server and use public DNS servers directlyFound the reason: I forgot to change the resolver settings (/etc/resolv.conf on the Linux PC).Had nothing to do in the router firewall setup (though I better should do something in the firewall, but atm q&d functionally has higher prio).Ok, now everything finally okThx.

Yes and no.It does keep stats for as long as the device is connected, aggregated.You can use Tools / Graphing but it can be a load on local resources.If you want more detailed info, you need to look at other options:Splunk:viewtopic.php?t=179960Kid control (someone here made a script to use Kid Control to collect stats etc. Maybe you can find it if you search a bit, I couldn't find it right away)...

My other router has such a useful traffic statistics page for the WAN interface (ie. Internet).Need a similar one for my MikroTik LTE interface b/c need to monitor (control) the traffic amount as it's not flat rate.Code:Select all
