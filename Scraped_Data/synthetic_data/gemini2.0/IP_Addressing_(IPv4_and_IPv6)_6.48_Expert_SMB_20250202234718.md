Okay, this is a substantial request!  Let's build a comprehensive technical document focusing on IP Addressing within MikroTik RouterOS, touching on the requested topics and incorporating the required elements. Given the sheer scope, we'll break this into logical sections.

**Document Start**

# MikroTik RouterOS: Expert Guide to IP Addressing (IPv4 & IPv6) - SMB Focus

This document provides an in-depth guide to IP addressing within MikroTik RouterOS (versions 6.48, 6.x and 7.x), targeting experienced administrators in Small to Medium Business (SMB) environments.  It covers IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, along with associated features and security best practices.

## 1. Scenario & Requirements

**Scenario:** We will configure a MikroTik router for a small office environment. This router will:

*   Act as the primary gateway to the internet for the office network.
*   Provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
*   Use DHCP to dynamically assign IPv4 addresses to devices on the LAN.
*   Support static IPv4 addresses for specific servers.
*   Be secured using MikroTik-specific firewall rules.
*   Provide internal DNS resolution.

**MikroTik Requirements:**

*   **RouterOS Version:** 6.48 (compatible with 6.x and 7.x)
*   **Interfaces:** At least two interfaces: one for internet connection (WAN) and one for the local network (LAN).
*   **Firewall:** A basic firewall setup to protect the network.
*   **DHCP Server:** To assign dynamic IPs to LAN clients.
*   **DNS Server:** Local DNS resolution for the local network.

## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation

This section details the implementation using both CLI and Winbox.

### 2.1. Initial Setup (CLI)

```mikrotik
# Reset to defaults (if needed, BE CAREFUL)
/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes

# Set router identity
/system identity set name=office-router

# Disable default configuration scripts
/system script remove numbers=0
```
**Explanation:**
* `/system reset-configuration no-defaults=yes`: Resets the RouterOS configuration. USE WITH CAUTION, as this will erase your current config.
* `/system identity set name=office-router`: Sets a descriptive name for the router.
* `/system script remove numbers=0`: Removes any default configuration scripts.

### 2.2. Interface Configuration (CLI)

Assume that:
*   `ether1` is the WAN interface (connected to the internet).
*   `ether2` is the LAN interface (connected to the local network).

```mikrotik
# Configure WAN interface (replace with actual settings from ISP)
/interface ethernet set ether1 name=wan comment="Internet Uplink"
/ip address add address=203.0.113.10/24 interface=wan comment="Public IP Address (replace)"

# Configure LAN interface
/interface ethernet set ether2 name=lan comment="Local Network"
/ip address add address=192.168.88.1/24 interface=lan comment="LAN IP Address"

# Enable IPv6 on LAN
/ipv6 address add address=2001:db8:1234:abcd::1/64 interface=lan comment="LAN IPv6 Address"
```
**Explanation:**
* `/interface ethernet set ...`: Sets name and comment for interface identification.
* `/ip address add ...`: Adds an IPv4 address to the interface.  The /24 specifies the subnet mask (255.255.255.0).
* `/ipv6 address add ...`: Adds an IPv6 address to the interface.  The /64 is the standard subnet for IPv6.

### 2.3. IP Pool Configuration (CLI)

This sets up a pool of IP addresses for the DHCP server.

```mikrotik
/ip pool add name=dhcp_pool ranges=192.168.88.100-192.168.88.200
```
**Explanation:**
* `/ip pool add ...`: Creates a new IP address pool named `dhcp_pool` containing a range of IP addresses.

### 2.4. DHCP Server Configuration (CLI)

This sets up the DHCP server on the LAN interface.

```mikrotik
/ip dhcp-server add name=dhcp_server address-pool=dhcp_pool interface=lan lease-time=1d disabled=no
/ip dhcp-server network add address=192.168.88.0/24 gateway=192.168.88.1 dns-server=192.168.88.1
```
**Explanation:**
* `/ip dhcp-server add ...`:  Creates a DHCP server tied to the `dhcp_pool` and LAN interface. `lease-time` specifies how long addresses are valid.
* `/ip dhcp-server network add ...`:  Configures the DHCP network parameters, including the gateway (router's LAN address) and DNS server (pointing back to the router).

### 2.5. Basic Firewall Setup (CLI)

```mikrotik
# Allow established and related connections
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward connection-state=established,related action=accept
/ip firewall filter add chain=input connection-state=established,related action=accept

# Allow ping from LAN
/ip firewall filter add chain=input protocol=icmp src-address=192.168.88.0/24 action=accept

# Drop invalid connections
/ip firewall filter add chain=input connection-state=invalid action=drop
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward connection-state=invalid action=drop


# NAT Masquerade (for internet access)
/ip firewall nat add chain=srcnat out-interface=wan action=masquerade
```
**Explanation:**
* `/ip firewall filter add ...`:  Creates firewall rules.
    * `chain=forward` rules apply to traffic passing through the router.
    * `chain=input` rules apply to traffic directed to the router itself.
    * `connection-state=established,related` allows established connections and their related traffic back through.
    * `action=accept` allows matching packets.
    * `action=drop` blocks matching packets.
* `/ip firewall nat add ...`: Creates a NAT rule for internet access.
    * `chain=srcnat` source NAT (network address translation).
    * `out-interface=wan`  interface where the NAT occurs (the WAN).
    * `action=masquerade` changes the source IP to the routers WAN IP address

### 2.6. IPv6 Router Advertisement (CLI)
```mikrotik
/ipv6 nd add interface=lan ra-interval=30s
```
**Explanation:**
* `/ipv6 nd add ...`: Enables Router Advertisement (RA) on the LAN interface. This is needed so that clients can auto-configure their IPv6 addresses. `ra-interval` set RA every 30s

### 2.7 DNS Setup (CLI)
```mikrotik
/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes
/ip dns static add address=192.168.88.1 name=router.local
```
**Explanation:**
* `/ip dns set allow-remote-requests=yes`: Enables the router's DNS server to answer queries from the local network.
* `/ip dns static add ...`: Creates a static DNS record for local resolution.  Replace router.local with the FQDN you want to resolve to your router's local IP address.

### 2.8. Winbox Configuration

*   You can perform similar steps via Winbox by navigating to the respective menus (e.g., `Interfaces`, `IP` > `Addresses`, `IP` > `Pool`, `IP` > `DHCP Server`, `IP` > `Firewall`, `IPv6` > `ND`).
*  Winbox makes it easier to visualize the configuration and troubleshoot some issues.

## 4. Common MikroTik Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect Interface Configuration:**  Mistaking which interface is WAN or LAN is a common issue.
*   **Overly Restrictive Firewall:** Firewall rules that are too aggressive can block legitimate traffic.
*   **Incorrect NAT Configuration:** Missing the NAT rule can prevent internet access.
*  **Missing DNS:** Forgetting to enable the DNS server or add it to the DHCP server can lead to name resolution issues.
*  **RA not Enabled:**  Without RA enabled for IPv6 clients will not receive addresses automatically.
*   **Conflicting IP Addresses:** Overlapping IP subnets can create routing issues and connectivity problems.

**Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Connectivity Issues:**
    *   Use `ping` to test reachability within the LAN and to the internet (e.g., `ping 8.8.8.8`).
    *   Use `traceroute` to diagnose network hops to the destination (e.g., `traceroute google.com`).
    *   Use `torch` to inspect traffic on interfaces in real-time.

    ```mikrotik
    /tool ping 8.8.8.8
    /tool traceroute google.com
    /tool torch interface=wan duration=10s
    ```
2. **DHCP issues:**
    *  Check the DHCP server leases to see if client devices receive an address with `/ip dhcp-server lease print`.
    * Check the log for DHCP server errors with `/log print`.
3. **Firewall issues:**
    * `/ip firewall filter print` to verify firewall rules.
    * Check the `/log print` for dropped packets.
    * Add log rules at the beginning of each chain to observe what traffic reaches that chain.

4.  **Interface Issues:**
    *   Use `/interface print` to check the interface status.
    *   Look for errors, dropped packets, or collisions.

5. **DNS Issues**
    *  Use `/tool dns-query name=router.local` to test internal DNS.
    *  Use `/tool dns-query name=google.com` to test external DNS.
6. **General Logging**
    * `/log print` is a powerful command for understanding all types of router issues. Pay close attention to what the router is doing and what errors it is logging.

**Diagnostics:**
* Use the `/tool` menu to run various diagnostics such as `ping`, `traceroute`, `torch`, `bandwidth-test`.
* Use `/system resource print` to check the system resources, CPU usage and memory usage to ensure the router is not running at its maximum.

## 5. Verification and Testing

1.  **Ping Tests:**
    *   From a LAN client, `ping` the router's LAN IP (`192.168.88.1`).
    *   From the router, `ping` an external IP address or hostname (e.g., `8.8.8.8`, `google.com`).

2.  **DHCP Verification:**
    *   Check if a LAN client obtains an IP address within the `dhcp_pool` range.
    *   Use `/ip dhcp-server lease print` on the MikroTik to view the lease information.

3.  **Internet Access:**
    *   Browse the internet from a LAN client.

4.  **Firewall Testing:**
    *   Try pinging the router's WAN IP from the internet (if it has a public IP) and verify it is blocked (as our firewall rule on input should stop this) unless ping is allowed.

5.  **IPv6 tests:**
    *  From a LAN client verify you receive an IPv6 address automatically and can ping the IPv6 address of the router.
    *  Ping an external IPv6 address.

6.  **DNS testing:**
    * Try pinging router.local from a LAN client.
    * Try pinging google.com from a LAN client.
