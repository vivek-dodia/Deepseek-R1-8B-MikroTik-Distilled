Okay, let's dive into a comprehensive technical document focused on IP Pools in MikroTik RouterOS, covering a wide range of related topics and fulfilling your requirements.  This document targets RouterOS v6.48 (but will largely apply to v7.x as well). We'll focus on an Enterprise scale implementation and level of explanation.

# MikroTik RouterOS: IP Pools - Comprehensive Technical Documentation

## 1. Comprehensive Configuration Scenario

**Scenario:** A mid-sized enterprise needs to segment its network into multiple VLANs for different departments (e.g., Marketing, Engineering, Guest Wi-Fi).  Each department requires its own dedicated IP address range, allocated from a central IP pool managed on a core MikroTik router.  We will also explore how to assign pools and the various configurations for those assignments. The goal is to create flexible and scalable IP management.

**MikroTik Requirements:**
-  The core router needs to manage different subnets (VLANs).
-  DHCP servers for each VLAN will use IP pools.
-  The IP pools must be easily managed and adjusted.
- We will implement IPv4 and explore IPv6 options as well.
- We will consider High Availability and redundancy.

## 2. Step-by-Step MikroTik Implementation

###  2.1. Basic VLAN and Interface Setup

**Step 1: VLAN Creation:**

* Use Winbox or CLI to create VLAN interfaces.
   -  Let's assume we have a parent interface called `ether1`.
    - We will create the following VLANs: `vlan100` (Marketing), `vlan200` (Engineering) and `vlan300` (Guest).

**CLI:**

```
/interface vlan
add interface=ether1 name=vlan100 vlan-id=100
add interface=ether1 name=vlan200 vlan-id=200
add interface=ether1 name=vlan300 vlan-id=300
```
**Winbox:**
* Go to `Interfaces > VLAN` and add interfaces.
* Set parent interface to ether1, specify `vlan-id` and a name for the interface.

**Step 2:  IP Address Assignment:**

* We need to assign an IP to each interface for routing purposes and for dhcp relay or service purposes.
* We will use the following ranges: 192.168.100.1/24 (vlan100), 192.168.200.1/24 (vlan200), and 192.168.300.1/24 (vlan300)

**CLI:**

```
/ip address
add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=vlan100
add address=192.168.200.1/24 interface=vlan200
add address=192.168.300.1/24 interface=vlan300
```
**Winbox:**
* Go to `IP > Addresses` and add new addresses.
* Assign IP address and select target interface.

### 2.2. IP Pool Creation

**Step 3: Define IP Pools:**

*  Create specific pools for each VLAN.

**CLI:**

```
/ip pool
add name=marketing-pool ranges=192.168.100.10-192.168.100.254
add name=engineering-pool ranges=192.168.200.10-192.168.200.254
add name=guest-pool ranges=192.168.300.10-192.168.300.254
```

**Winbox:**
* Go to `IP > Pools`.
* Add new pool, providing a name and specifying the IP address ranges.

### 2.3. DHCP Server Setup

**Step 4: DHCP Server Configuration:**

* Configure DHCP servers to lease from the newly created IP pools for each interface.

**CLI:**

```
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=marketing-pool disabled=no interface=vlan100 name=dhcp-marketing
add address-pool=engineering-pool disabled=no interface=vlan200 name=dhcp-engineering
add address-pool=guest-pool disabled=no interface=vlan300 name=dhcp-guest
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.100.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.100.1
add address=192.168.200.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.200.1
add address=192.168.300.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 gateway=192.168.300.1
```

**Winbox:**
* Go to `IP > DHCP Server`.
* Add new dhcp-server, select interface and the associated ip-pool.
* Go to `IP > DHCP Server > Networks`
* Add new network.
* Select address space and set gateway, dns-servers and other options for each network.

### 2.4. Example IP Pools and DHCP Server configuration for IPv6
**Step 1: Interface IPv6 address assignment:**
We need to assign IPv6 addresses to each of our VLAN interfaces for IPv6 routing and dhcp purposes.  We will use the 2001:db8::/64 prefix and assign the second address with the following convention : `vlan100` will get 2001:db8::2/64, `vlan200` will get 2001:db8::2002/64 and `vlan300` will get 2001:db8::3002/64
**CLI:**
```
/ipv6 address
add address=2001:db8::2/64 interface=vlan100
add address=2001:db8::2002/64 interface=vlan200
add address=2001:db8::3002/64 interface=vlan300
```
**Step 2: IPv6 Pools**
Now we need to configure IPv6 pools for each VLAN, we will give out addresses within the ::10-::ffff range.
```
/ipv6 pool
add name=marketing-pool-v6 prefix=2001:db8::/64 prefix-length=64
add name=engineering-pool-v6 prefix=2001:db8::/64 prefix-length=64
add name=guest-pool-v6 prefix=2001:db8::/64 prefix-length=64
```
**Step 3: DHCP IPv6 Server Configuration**
We need to configure a DHCPv6 server for each vlan.
```
/ipv6 dhcp-server
add address-pool=marketing-pool-v6 interface=vlan100 name=dhcp-marketing-v6
add address-pool=engineering-pool-v6 interface=vlan200 name=dhcp-engineering-v6
add address-pool=guest-pool-v6 interface=vlan300 name=dhcp-guest-v6
/ipv6 dhcp-server network
add address=2001:db8::/64 dns-server=2001:4860:4860::8888,2001:4860:4860::8844 domain=example.com
```

## 4. Common MikroTik-Specific Pitfalls, Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics

**Pitfalls:**

*   **Incorrect IP Range:**  Overlapping pools or ranges outside the interface network.
*   **DHCP Server on Wrong Interface:** Accidentally binding a DHCP server to the wrong VLAN.
*   **DHCP Lease Issues:**  Clients not getting IP addresses (check DHCP server logs, see below)
* **VLAN tagging problems**: Make sure that switches are configured to pass tagged traffic through the trunk, and the devices receive the tagged traffic as expected.

**Troubleshooting:**

1.  **Check Interface Status:** `/interface print`. Verify that all interfaces are enabled and that the link is up for Ethernet.
2.  **DHCP Server Logs:** `/log print where topics~"dhcp"` for server logs. Look for lease assignment or failure messages.
3.  **IP Address Conflicts:** `/ip address print` ensure no IP address conflicts exist.
4.  **IP Pool Status:** `/ip pool print` shows the assigned addresses within pools.
5.  **Ping Test:**  Use `/ping <Destination IP>` to verify connectivity.

**Diagnostics:**

*   **Torch:** `/tool torch interface=<Interface Name>` for live packet capture.
*   **Packet Sniffer:** `/tool sniffer quick interface=<Interface Name>` can capture data for offline analysis.
*   **Traceroute:** `/tool traceroute <Destination IP>` for network path analysis.

## 5. Verification and Testing Steps

1.  **DHCP Client Test:** Connect devices to each VLAN and verify DHCP leases and IP assignments.
2.  **Connectivity Test:** Use `ping` to ensure clients can reach the gateway IP and Internet resources.
3.  **Traceroute Test:** From a connected client trace to an outside resource to verify routing is correct.
4.  **Packet Capture:** Use torch on the interfaces to monitor network communication and catch any issues.
5. **Monitor Interface Stats:** Use the Interface Stats in Winbox, or `/interface monitor <interface>` in the CLI to monitor traffic statistics, link errors, and packet drops. This can identify if there are issues with hardware or the interface itself.

## 6. Related MikroTik-Specific Features, Capabilities, and Limitations

*   **Hotspot:** MikroTik's Hotspot feature uses IP pools for user authentication.
*   **VPN:**  IPsec, L2TP, and PPTP can use pools for client IPs.
*  **Firewall:** RouterOS Firewall rules can be used to block or allow traffic based on pool usage.
* **Dynamic Routing:** IP pools can be used in conjunction with dynamic routing to automatically allocate addresses for new routes.
*   **Limitations:** IP pools are contiguous ranges.  Non-contiguous allocation requires separate pools. While MikroTik supports very large pools, consider breaking very large ranges into smaller ones for manageability.
*  **VRF:** Virtual Routing and Forwarding can make use of IP pools, creating dedicated routing tables and forwarding domains.
* **L3HW offload**: Hardware offloading can enhance performance, but make sure the switch chip supports the feature for all of the required functions, such as QoS, Firewalling, and NAT.

## 7. MikroTik REST API Examples

*Note: The RouterOS API is not a full REST API. It uses a proprietary binary protocol on top of TCP/IP and has its own way of accessing the system.  It does expose JSON-formatted data in responses which is often treated as "REST-like".  These examples use the MikroTik API and assume the API service is enabled and accessible.*

**Example 1:  Retrieve IP Pool List**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/pool`
*   **Request Method:** `GET`
*   **Example Python Code (using `routeros_api` library):**

```python
import routeros_api

try:
    # Connect to router
    api = routeros_api.RouterOsApiPool(username='<api_username>', password='<api_password>', host='<router_ip>', port=8728, use_ssl=True, ssl_verify=False, ssl_verify_hostname=False)
    # Fetch Pools
    pools = api.get_resource('/ip/pool').get()
    print("IP Pools:")
    for pool in pools:
      print(pool)
except routeros_api.exceptions.RouterOsApiError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

*   **Expected Response:** A list of IP pool objects in JSON format, like this:

```json
[
    {
        ".id": "*1",
        "name": "marketing-pool",
        "ranges": "192.168.100.10-192.168.100.254"
    },
    {
        ".id": "*2",
        "name": "engineering-pool",
        "ranges": "192.168.200.10-192.168.200.254"
    },
 {
        ".id": "*3",
        "name": "guest-pool",
        "ranges": "192.168.300.10-192.168.300.254"
    }
]
```

**Example 2: Create a New IP Pool**

*   **API Endpoint:** `/ip/pool`
*   **Request Method:** `POST`
*   **Example Python Code:**

```python
import routeros_api

try:
    # Connect to router
    api = routeros_api.RouterOsApiPool(username='<api_username>', password='<api_password>', host='<router_ip>', port=8728, use_ssl=True, ssl_verify=False, ssl_verify_hostname=False)
    # Add Pool
    new_pool = api.get_resource('/ip/pool').add(name='new-pool', ranges='192.168.400.10-192.168.400.254')
    print(f"New Pool Created with ID: {new_pool['ret']}")
except routeros_api.exceptions.RouterOsApiError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

*   **Expected Response:** A dictionary confirming the successful creation of the new IP pool and its internal id, similar to this:

```json
{
    "ret": "*4"
}
```

**Example 3: Modify a pool with a PUT (set) request**
```python
import routeros_api

try:
    # Connect to router
    api = routeros_api.RouterOsApiPool(username='<api_username>', password='<api_password>', host='<router_ip>', port=8728, use_ssl=True, ssl_verify=False, ssl_verify_hostname=False)
    # Modify Pool
    api.get_resource('/ip/pool').set(numbers='*3', ranges='192.168.300.50-192.168.300.250')
    print(f"Pool *3 has been modified")
except routeros_api.exceptions.RouterOsApiError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

**Example 4: Remove a pool with delete request**
```python
import routeros_api

try:
    # Connect to router
    api = routeros_api.RouterOsApiPool(username='<api_username>', password='<api_password>', host='<router_ip>', port=8728, use_ssl=True, ssl_verify=False, ssl_verify_hostname=False)
    # Remove Pool
    api.get_resource('/ip/pool').remove(numbers='*4')
    print(f"Pool *4 has been deleted")
except routeros_api.exceptions.RouterOsApiError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

## 8. In-Depth Explanations of Core Concepts

*   **Bridging:** RouterOS bridging allows multiple interfaces to act as one logical segment, sharing the same Layer 2 domain. Bridging can include VLANs. In this case, we are not using bridging but instead routing between vlan interfaces.
*   **Routing:** In this scenario, each VLAN is routed as a separate layer 3 network. The MikroTik router maintains a routing table to forward packets between the VLANs.
*   **Firewall:** MikroTik's firewall provides access control between interfaces, implementing NAT, and more advanced features. Firewall rules allow or block traffic based on source IP/pool, destination, protocol, and port.
*   **IP Addressing:**  IPv4 and IPv6 use logical addresses for network devices.  Subnets allow dividing networks into smaller logical groups. In this case, we used /24 for IPv4 and /64 for IPv6 as an example.
*   **DHCP:** A DHCP server automatically assigns IP addresses from a configured range. IP pools are used to define this range. DHCP leases provide a temporary IP address to network clients.

## 9. Security Best Practices

1.  **Strong Passwords:**  Use long and complex passwords for the MikroTik administrator account.
2.  **Change Default Ports:** Change the default API port (8728), web interface port (80) and SSH port (22) to something else.
3.  **Restrict API Access:** Limit API access to trusted IP addresses using firewall rules.
4.  **Enable Firewall:** Configure the firewall to block unwanted access, especially from the outside world. Block access to the management interfaces from outside the LAN.
5.  **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any unused services like Telnet, FTP, or API access for specific interfaces.
6.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep RouterOS updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
7.  **HTTPS for Winbox/Webfig:** Always use secure HTTPS access for Webfig/Winbox access. Enable TLS for Winbox API.
8.  **Rate limiting:** Rate limit connections to management services, or specific interfaces to prevent DoS attacks.
9. **Log review:** Frequently review the system logs and look for security-related messages. Use email or other alert system to notify administrators of possible security issues.
10. **Regular backups:** Ensure regular backups are taken, and stored securely in case of need for recovery.
11. **Use MAC Server and only allow approved MAC addresses** A MAC server can be used to authorize devices on the network to add another layer of security.
12. **Disable unused MACVLAN interfaces**. Delete or disable any interfaces which are not required by the system.

## 10. Detailed Explanations and Configuration Examples

This section builds upon the previously discussed core principles and provides in-depth information for each requested topic.

### IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

**IPv4:**

*   **Structure:**  32-bit address, represented in dotted decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   **Subnetting:** Divides networks into smaller groups using subnet masks or CIDR notation. For example:
    *   `/24` is 255.255.255.0 with 254 usable addresses
    *   `/16` is 255.255.0.0 with 65534 usable addresses
*   **Configuration:** Using `/ip address` commands, assigning to interfaces, configuring networks with gateways.

**IPv6:**

*   **Structure:** 128-bit address, represented in hexadecimal separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
*   **Shorthand:** Double colons `::` represent a series of zeros.
*  **Subnetting:**  Uses prefix length, such as `/64` or `/48`. Typical practice is `/64` for most networks. For example `/48` allows 65535 `/64` subnets
*   **Configuration:** Using `/ipv6 address` commands, assigning to interfaces, and configuring the `/ipv6 dhcp-server` for clients.
*   **Example:** `/ipv6 address add address=2001:db8::1/64 interface=ether1`

### IP Pools

*   **Definition:**  A set of IP addresses that can be used for DHCP leases, Hotspot users, VPN clients, etc.
*   **Configuration:** `ip pool add name=pool1 ranges=192.168.1.10-192.168.1.200`
*  **Ranges:** Use of ranges to specify addresses within a pool is mandatory.
*   **Limitations:** Contiguous ranges only. Each pool is defined by a start address and an end address.

### IP Routing

*   **Function:**  Directs network traffic between different networks.
*   **Routing Table:** Stores network destinations and next-hop information.
*   **Static Routes:** Manually configured routes: `/ip route add dst-address=10.1.1.0/24 gateway=192.168.1.2`
*   **Dynamic Routing:**  Protocols like OSPF, RIP, and BGP to learn routes automatically. We will look at BGP later on.
*   **Policy Routing:** Allows routing based on source, destination, protocol, or any parameter. Can be used to route traffic based on the source subnet.
*   **VRF:** Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances for creating completely isolated routing domains on the same router.
*   **Multicast:** Routing of multicast traffic for special applications like IPTV or multi-party communication.

### IP Settings

*   **Configurable Settings:**  `IP > Settings`:
    *   `Disable Fast Track`: Speeds up packet processing for more complex configurations
    *   `Allow Fast Path`: Faster forwarding of packets on bridge and routed interfaces.
    *   `ARP Timeout`:  Adjusts the time for ARP cache entries.
    *  `TCP Timestamp, Selective Ack and Window Scaling`: TCP settings for better congestion control and higher transfer rate.
    *  `Router ID`: Used by dynamic routing protocols.
*   **Use Case:** Optimizing forwarding settings and tuning low level networking behavior.
*   **Important Notes:** Experiment carefully, as incorrect settings can cause connectivity problems.

### MAC Server

*   **Purpose:** Authenticates users based on MAC addresses.
*   **Configuration:** `/mac-server mac-winbox set enabled=yes allowed-mac-address=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`
*   **Use Case:** Only allowing known devices to access the network, adding another layer of authentication and security. Can be configured to limit the interfaces from which it listens for connections.
*   **Notes:** It is often better to use another authentication method in place of MAC authentication if possible, such as 802.1x or certificate based authentication.

### RoMON

*   **Purpose:**  Remote monitoring and management tool.
*   **Configuration:** `/romon set enabled=yes id=your_romon_id`
*   **Use Case:** Connect to routers via RoMON which helps you manage the device when IP address or other networking issues exist.
*   **Notes:** RoMON uses a specific port for remote access.
* **Security**: RoMON has its own password to protect it, it is advised to use strong and different password from other services

### WinBox

*   **Protocols:** 802.1x, WPA Enterprise use RADIUS servers.

### User / User Groups

*   **Purpose:** Managing local user accounts and access permissions.
*   **Configuration:** `/user` menu. Create users, assign to user groups with specific permissions.
*   **Use Case:** Limiting access to different RouterOS features and management tools.
*   **Notes:**  User management is crucial for security.

### Bridging and Switching

*   **Bridging:**  Connects network segments at Layer 2. Devices on a bridge share the same broadcast domain.
*   **Switching:**  Forwarding packets within a bridge based on MAC address tables.
*   **VLANs:** VLANs segment a bridge into different logical networks.
*   **Configuration:** `/interface bridge` and `/interface bridge port` commands.
*   **Use Case:** Extending networks and supporting VLAN separation for network segmentation.
*   **Switch Chip Features:** Some MikroTik devices have specialized switch chips which offer line-rate switching, hardware offload for faster packet processing, and lower latency. VLAN configuration is often also offloaded to the switch chip.

### MACVLAN

*   **Purpose:** Create virtual interfaces with unique MAC addresses on a physical interface.
*   **Configuration:** `/interface macvlan add interface=ether1 mac-address=00:01:02:03:04:05`
*   **Use Case:** Running multiple virtual devices from one physical interface, like running multiple docker containers with independent MAC address.
*   **Notes:** MACVLAN should be used in specific cases where different MAC addresses are needed.

### L3 Hardware Offloading

*   **Purpose:**  Offload routing and NAT to the hardware.
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by default in RouterOS.
*   **Use Case:** Greatly increased throughput and lower latency for more demanding networks.
*   **Limitations:**  Not all features can be offloaded and some special features of RouterOS can cause offloading to be disabled. Can be problematic on RouterOS older versions. Check official documentation for compatibility.

### MACsec

*   **Purpose:**  Provides security at Layer 2, using MAC address as the base layer.
*   **Configuration:** Complex setup involving key exchange between peers.

*   **Configuration:**  Settings within `/interface bridge port`.
*   **Use Case:** Increase switching speed and reduce CPU usage, can help make your switch act like a managed switch, can implement port isolation, rate limiting, and port mirroring.
*  **Notes:** Configuration depends on the specific MikroTik device and switch chip.

### VLAN

*   **Purpose:** Segment a physical network into logical networks.
*   **Configuration:** `interface vlan add vlan-id=100 interface=ether1`
*   **Use Case:** Network segmentation, increase performance, broadcast domain control, creating isolated security zones for different purposes.
*   **Notes:** VLAN tagging on interfaces is essential.
*   **IEEE 802.1Q standard:** Based on this industry standard, making VLAN interop with other vendor devices.

### VXLAN

*   **Purpose:**  Layer 2 network tunneling across layer 3 IP networks, providing virtual networks on top of the IP infrastructure.
*   **Configuration:** `interface vxlan add name=vxlan1 vni=1000 remote-address=192.168.1.10`
*   **Use Case:** Virtualizing networks and creating secure network overlay to extend broadcast domain over different IP networks.
*   **Notes:**  Requires careful configuration for proper operation.
*   **VNI** VXLAN Network identifier must be consistent on different tunnel endpoints.
*  **Requires MTU configuration**:  VXLAN adds extra bytes to the packets, so the MTU needs to be adjusted on all related interfaces.

### Firewall and Quality of Service

#### Connection Tracking
*   **Purpose:**  RouterOS tracks stateful connections to use in firewall rules.
*   **Benefits:** Allows for more secure and efficient filtering of network traffic.
*   **Configuration:** No direct configuration of connection tracking, but firewall rules rely on connection tracking.
*  **Notes:** Connection tracking table has a limited size and can be affected by high traffic.

#### Firewall

*   **Purpose:** Control network traffic based on source, destination, protocol, port, and other parameters.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip firewall filter` `/ip firewall nat`
*   **Chain:** Chains, like `input`, `forward`, `output`, define the direction of traffic.
*   **Action:** Allow, drop, reject, log, etc.
*   **Mangle:** Allows modifying packets before they go through the router.
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation):**  Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice-versa, to allow devices inside a LAN to access the internet.
*   **Security**:  Firewall is a critical component of a secure MikroTik setup.
*   **Example:** Block traffic from 10.0.0.0/8 to the internet: `/ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address=10.0.0.0/8 dst-address=!192.168.0.0/16 action=drop`

#### Packet Flow in RouterOS

*   **Input Chain:** Packets destined for the router itself.
*   **Forward Chain:** Packets passing through the router.
*   **Output Chain:** Packets generated by the router.
*   **Understanding:** Packet flow helps to configure rules effectively.
*   **Rules:** Packets traverse each chain.

#### Queues

*   **Purpose:** Control bandwidth allocation, delay, and traffic shaping.
*   **Configuration:** `/queue simple` `/queue tree` commands.
*   **Types:** Simple queues, queue trees (HTB), PCQ.
*   **Use Case:** Prioritizing voice and video, limiting bandwidth for torrents, shaping traffic for different users.
*   **Notes:** Careful queue configuration is essential for good QoS.

#### Firewall and QoS Case Studies

*   **Example:** Prioritizing VoIP: Use mangle to mark VoIP packets and then prioritize with queues using the DSCP (DiffServ Code Point) marker.
*   **Web Filtering:**  Use Layer 7 firewall to block certain web categories or sites.
*   **Gaming Priority:** Use queue trees to shape traffic and prioritize gaming packets.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Use monitoring and torch to detect any issues and modify your rules and queues.

#### Kid Control

*   **Purpose:** Restrict internet access for children.
*   **Implementation:** Use firewall rules and time schedules.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address=<child-ip-range> time=20:00-08:00 action=drop`
*   **Notes:** Multiple strategies possible: block websites, block access during specific times, etc.

#### UPnP

*   **Purpose:** Enable automatic port forwarding by applications.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip upnp set enabled=yes allow-disable-external=yes`
*   **Use Case:** Convenient for gaming consoles and other devices which need port forwarding automatically.
*   **Security Notes:** UPnP can be a security risk if not managed properly. Can expose services unintentionally.

#### NAT-PMP

*   **Purpose:** Another mechanism for automatic port forwarding.
*   **Configuration:** Similar to UPnP.
*   **Use Case:** Similar to UPnP, also convenient for services inside the network, however NAT-PMP is less common than UPnP.
*   **Security Notes:** Can be a security risk, limit usage as much as possible.

### IP Services (DHCP, DNS, SOCKS, Proxy)

#### DHCP

*   **Purpose:** Assign IP addresses automatically.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip dhcp-server`
*   **DHCP Lease:** Dynamic IP assignments for clients.
*   **DHCP Relay:** Forwards DHCP requests to another DHCP server.
*   **Use Case:** Automatic IP configuration for clients, managing large number of clients on a network.
*   **Example:** See previously mentioned DHCP settings.

#### DNS

*   **Purpose:** Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip dns`
*   **DNS Forwarding:** Forwards requests to upstream DNS servers, such as Google DNS, Cloudflare, or your ISPs'
*  **DNS Cache:** Caches resolved DNS entries for faster future lookups.
*   **Static DNS:** Adding static domain names to IP mapping for local services, or to use your own private DNS server inside the LAN.
*   **Use Case:** Basic network connectivity, internal DNS server, blocking of domains.
*   **Security Note**: DNS can be used for malicious purposes, use secure upstream servers and consider security implications.

#### SOCKS

*   **Purpose:** An application layer proxy, can be configured to forward specific requests through the proxy.
*   **Configuration:** `/ip socks` command.
*   **Use Case:** Provides a proxy for forwarding all traffic through the proxy or just some traffic as required by clients.
*   **Notes:** Supports SOCKS v4
