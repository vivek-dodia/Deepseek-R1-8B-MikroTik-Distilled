Howdy!I have configured the DHCPv6 client as below:Code:Select all/ipv6 dhcp-client
add interface=ether1 pool-name=0 request=address,prefix use-interface-duid=yes use-peer-dns=noThis seems to work as my ISP sends me both an address and a prefixCode:Select all/ipv6/dhcp-client> /ipv6/dhcp-client/print 
Columns: INTERFACE, STATUS, REQUEST, PREFIX, ADDRESS
# INTERFACE  STATUS  REQUEST  PREFIX                         ADDRESS                    
0 ether1     bound   address  2a07:6aa1:5:202c::/64, 47m31s  2a07:6aa1:5:1031::3, 47m31s
                     prefixbut it seems like RouterOS never assignes the recived address on ether1 as I would expect:Code:Select all/ipv6/address/print 
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; G - GLOBAL, L - LINK-LOCAL
Columns: ADDRESS, INTERFACE, ADVERTISE, VALID
#    ADDRESS                                    INTERFACE  ADVERTISE  VALID 
0 D  ::1/128                                    lo         no               
1 DL fe80::1afd:74ff:fe27:d4c/64                ether1     no               
2 DL fe80::1afd:74ff:fe27:d4d/64                bridge     no               
3 DG fd0a:1a81:cbdf:d546:1afd:74ff:fe27:d4d/64  bridge     no         11m58sIs this behaviour correct? Are my expectations wrong?

Which ROS version? Only newer v7 versions correctly display dynamic IPv6 addresses and routes, older versions (including all v6 versions) omit them from print command. Addresses and routes are there or else IPv6 wouldn't work in certain aspects.

To me, it doesn't seem correct. On 7.14.3, I have got the following:Code:Select all[me@myTik] > ipv6/dhcp-client/print
Columns: INTERFACE, STATUS, REQUEST, PREFIX, ADDRESS
# INTERFACE  STATUS  REQUEST  PREFIX                                ADDRESS
0 ether1     bound   address  2xxx:xxxx:xxxx:4a63::/64, 56w2d8h8m8s  2xxx:xxxx:yyyy:yyyy:0:ffff:a0c:4a63, 56w2d8h8m8s
                     prefix

[me@myTik] > ipv6/address/print where global
Flags: D - DYNAMIC; G - GLOBAL
Columns: ADDRESS, FROM-POOL, INTERFACE, ADVERTISE
#    ADDRESS                                FROM-POOL  INTERFACE  ADVERTISE
0  G 2xxx:xxxx:xxxx:4a63::1/64               isp        bridge6    yes
1 DG 2xxx:xxxx:yyyy:yyyy:0:ffff:a0c:4a63/128             ether1     no

Thanks for the replies!Enabled "Add Default Route" for the DHCP Client and then directly disabled it again. This caused the addresses to get assigned.Maybe the client was stuck in some state and forced to restart when I fiddled it.Problem solved - should I report it as a bug?

Most likely yes, but if you haven't created a supout.rif file while it was still misbehaving, chances that gents in Riga will be able to do anything about it are way lower.
