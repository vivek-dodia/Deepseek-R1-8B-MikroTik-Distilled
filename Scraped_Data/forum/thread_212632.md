I guess I'm saying Mikrotik runs VPN proxy (BTH) and /ip/cloud DDNS already.  So some PHP should actually be easier than BTH to secure.....and why I present the question.As a data point, I ran a ping over the weekend, it was ~250ms from the west coast to Mikrotik/Lativia, with 1.5% packet loss – which is similar to what I've seen in past.Code:Select all

No, just "forum.mikrotik.com". But don’t take my word for it, call or email some of them and they’ll explain how it works.Btw, here's a list of popular DDoS protection service providers. Most providers have their services spread out across all continents, and in many cases, you can pick which data center to use.codeEDIT:Just an example ofCloudflare's pricing model:- Pro - for professional websites that aren’t business-critical, $25/month.- Business - for small businesses operating online, $250/month.

migrate to other forum software that supports load balancing, high availibility etcIm 100% sure one can do this with PHPBB and HAProxyhttps://www.haproxy.org/EDIT:something like this should work like a charm:Code:Select all
