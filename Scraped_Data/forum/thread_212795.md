You may want to look at output of command/interface/wifi/printand/interface/wifi/security/print(run them in terminal window ... you can start one from WinBox or connect to device using ssh)  ... and look for "encryption" property in both outputs. Only then you'll see what is actually configured on device. Default (if property is unset) is "ccmp" only ... which is basically good ole AES in WPA2. So if you don't enable it explicitly, TKIP won't be available.According to my experience it's mostly safe to enable "ccmp,ccmp-256" while any of gcmp tends to freak out many not-so-modern devices.
